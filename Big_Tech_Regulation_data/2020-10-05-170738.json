It includes draconian measures that would allow for constant monitoring of internet users, weakening of encryption in messaging apps, and mandatory ID registration to access and use social media in the country - among other dangerous provisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In discussion since early April, the bill's supporters rushed it through Congress and fast-tracked revisions up until this week, without properly consulting any civil society, academia, business stakeholders, or technical experts during its development or discussion. This comes in the context of an unprecedented public health crisis as Brazil faces a surge of COVID-19 infections.</p><p>The bill that would seriously harm free expression, privacy, freedom of association, and other human rights. Some of the most dangerous provisions would:</p><p>* Require social media and communication services to collect a valid ID and cell phone number for the creation of accounts;</p><p>* Demand the mass traceability of messages in messaging apps and \"communication systems\" in ways that can break privacy-preserving end-to-end encryption;</p><p>* Enable the suspension of entire internet applications, like WhatsApp or Telegram, at the national level, as a penalty for services who fail to comply with the provisions of the bill, without any valuation about necessity and proportionality; and</p><p>* Risk restricting and criminalizing people's law-abiding online activity through vague definitions of forbidden behavior.</p><p>Brazilian digital rights advocacy group Coalizao Direitos na Rede (<url normalizedValue=\"https://direitosnarede.org.br/2020/06/20/pl-das-fake-news-relatorio-estabelece-identificacao-e-criminalizacao-em-massa-de-usuarios.html\">https://direitosnarede.org.br/2020/06/20/pl-das-fake-news-relatorio-estabelece-identificacao-e-criminalizacao-em-massa-de-usuarios.html</url>) called attention to what could be \"one of the worst internet bills around the world due to the threats to privacy and freedom of expression it poses.\" The group also stated, \"Brazilian Senators and Parliamentarians need to consider international recommendations on the topic of misinformation instead of promoting a regulation that sets penalties to users based on vague and ambiguous ideas at the risk of revoking fundamental human rights for all Internet users in the country.\"</p><p>Javier Pallero, Latin America Policy Lead and Global Content Governance Lead at Access Now, added, \"In addition to the human rights harms it could enable, the bill will end up entrenching the power of concentrated big tech platforms by statute, by forcing them to collect and manage real ID data and surveil user's conversations.\"</p><p>Any content governance legislation should put human rights and the needs of the most vulnerable at their center.

That was the key takeaway from the opening session of the In2 Innovation Summit MENA, held in Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai, today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hosted by the region's leading public relations agency, ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, the panel, titled PR &amp; The New Trust Equation, gathered experts from the fields of communications and the media from the region.</p><p>Introducing the session, moderator Sunil John, founder &amp; CEO of ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, warned that that the media landscape was at a tipping point, with the rise of fake news and algorithm-driven content creating echo chambers and threatening to further erode trust between the public and media, governments and organisations. \"Big tech is not neutral,\" he said. \"Some people are comparing its influence to 'big tobacco' of old. Do we need regulation to deal with that? That is one of the big questions of the day.\"</p><p>Asked \"who is more trusted? PR or news media?\" panelist Brian Lott, Head of Corporate Communications, Mubadala, said that despite the rise of fake news, he thought the public still believed in media more than PR, adding that communications had a big role to play in rebuilding trust. \"Our challenge is to drive people to more authentic and truthful content,\" he said. \"People want truth \u2026 they want reality, not unreality. And PR has always communicated that reality in an interesting and compelling way. With advertising being viewed more skeptically, we have an opportunity to take advantage of that.\"</p><p>Faisal J Abbas, Editor-in-Chief of Arab News, warned that new media platforms were undermining the legitimacy and reputation of traditional media. \"My question from this region is, why is it you are tolerating terror propaganda on these outlets? The reality is children are being radicalised, they are being sent to fight in Syria,\" he said. \"With the great reach and impact that social media has, there must be a great responsibility.\" But he warned that the role of censor or regulator should not be played by government, and that the platforms themselves should better police their content.</p><p>Valerie Tan, Vice President Public Relations, Social Media, Internal Communications, at Emirates, said media had much more to lose in the current debate. \"People have always understood that PR and advertising has an agenda \u2026 now they realise that news outlets come with an agenda, too.\"</p><p>Paul Holmes, Chair &amp; Founder, The Holmes Report, warned that the biggest danger came not from fake news itself but from attacks on legitimate news stories. \"There's a concerted effort to portray legitimate journalism as fake news,\" he said. \"This is a huge problem for the media and for us in PR, undermining the credibility of both.\" He added that PR practitioners have \"a moral obligation not to pollute those channels, social and mainstream, with our own fake news\".</p><p>Switching towards the PR industry's own reputation, John cited the demise of Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm that went into administration following a much cricticised and racially charged campaign in South Africa. He asked whether PR firms had a moral choice to make over which clients they represent. \"Many agencies were involved in so-called 'dark arts and spin' ... two phrases I hate,\" he said. \"But in Bell Pottinger's case, their downfall came from within \u2013 they were expelled from the industry body PRCA for bringing the industry into disrepute.\"</p><p>Holmes said that Lord Bell, the former chairman of Bell Pottinger, had \"a view of PR being untenable in the modern world.\" He added: \"The divide between what is good PR and what is moral and ethical is, today, for the most part invisible. They are congruent in a way they never were 30 years ago. Ethics has to be at the heart of what we want to do. It's possible to do honorable work for bad companies. Equally it's possible to do dishonorable work for good companies.\"</p><p>Abbas, however, criticised the industry for \"being on the defensive\" over the allegations of 'spin'.\u00a0 \"We need to agree that perhaps most of the world looks at the PR industry as lobbyists,\" he said. \"You are hired on behalf of client, not the people, and you are paid to do a particular job, and they want value for money.\"</p><p>Tan said that PR was still struggling to shake off its negative reputation. \"PR has some way to go to convince we are not 'spin doctors'. People know PR comes with an agenda, but it shouldn't be a negative, it's actually very helpful,\" she said. John added there was a responsibility for PR professionals and media to ensure a free and honest exchange of ideas.</p><p>Holmes insisted that the industry was not just about maximising profit but also about relationship building and emotional intelligence, something John agreed with, saying: \"Reputation is the most precious commodity in the world we live in today and as PR professionals, it's important we protect that for our clients and our brands.\"</p><p>Returning to media, and media literacy, the panellists agreed more needed to be done in educating the public on how to separate good news from bad, before Abbas wrapped up the session with a plea for the industry to not lose sight of values. \"If you want the truth, read the media; if you want the exposure, work with bloggers and influencers.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/14/151928218681.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/14/151928218681.jpg</url></p><p>Accuracy, transparency and open exchange of ideas key to a strong and ethical PR industry <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/5/151928218874.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/5/151928218874.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MDAVME-110447756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MDAVME2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPP-H2X1-JDJN-62XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 World of Media JLT Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

It is so closely associated with the school that the thinking is widely known as \u201cthe Chicago School of antitrust.\u201d</p><p>But amid growing concerns about the unchecked power of today\u2019s tech giants, economists and legal scholars are questioning whether the Chicago School still makes sense. Even the university\u2019s own faculty is starting to publicly challenge the ideology.</p><p>At a convocation ceremony in June, Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the university\u2019s Booth School of Business, warned about the corrosive influence of monopolies and declared that the Chicago School had a blind spot when it came to Big Tech.</p><p>\u201cOur antitrust laws cannot do anything against these types of monopolies,\u201d said Mr. Zingales, who is the head of the university\u2019s George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, in his address. \u201cThe world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too.\u201d</p><p>A 56-year-old native of Padua, Italy, who has taught at the school since 1992, Mr. Zingales adheres to many of the traditional hallmarks of University of Chicago economics \u2014 free markets, small government and low taxes. But he is not an ideologue. After the financial crisis, he opposed breaking up the big banks but said later that he had been wrong.</p><p>His recent work laments that the American capitalist system has become corrupted by cronyism and companies that are too big, too powerful and too enmeshed with the overall economy.</p><p>When the Federal Trade Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjxSvIxvqQ\">decided to close a broad investigation</url> into Google without taking any action in 2013, Mr. Zingales said in a recent interview, it was clear that regulators were not sufficiently aggressive going after the new monopolies.</p><p>Although never shy about speaking out \u2014 he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjxSvIxvqQ\">predicted in 2011</url> that Donald J. Trump could win the presidency \u2014 Mr. Zingales became more vocal about the need for the Chicago School position to evolve. He said that today\u2019s tech giants were \u201cunprecedented in nature\u201d and that the rules of traditional economics did not apply to these companies.</p><p>For the last three years, Mr. Zingales and the Stigler Center have hosted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjxSvIxvqQ\">an antitrust summit</url>. The 2018 and 2019 conferences focused on how to deal with digital platforms like Google and Facebook. He gathered most of the leading antitrust scholars, a handful of top regulators, judges and attorneys general to come up with proposals on how monopoly policy should deal with the tech giants.</p><p>Discussions at those two conferences have been echoed in recent decisions by the Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general to investigate antitrust claims against Big Tech.</p><p>At last year\u2019s summit, Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, told attendees that his view of the cost of free platforms \u201chas changed\u201d with a greater understanding of the nature and scope of data collection and sharing.</p><p>An attorney general at this year\u2019s conference, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, was one of the main speakers when states announced an antitrust investigation into Google last week.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you have prominent people at Chicago calling for antitrust enforcement is changing the game,\u201d said Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who is the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.</p><p>Mr. Zingales started a podcast with Kate Waldock, an assistant professor of finance at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, in 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjxSvIxvqQ\">called \u201cCapitalisn\u2019t\u201d</url> about what works well in the current economy and what does not.</p><p>Their first episode called for more antitrust enforcement of Facebook and Google, centered on the idea of how dangerous it would be if Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, decided to run for president \u2014 which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjxSvIxvqQ\">didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched</url> at the time.</p><p>The Chicago School started to gain prominence in the 1970s in response to concerns about overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. It argued that it was not enough for companies to possess significant market power; regulators and judges had to prove through economic analysis that consumers were harmed through higher prices.</p><p>The ideology has influenced a generation of judges and regulators, who have taken a restrained approach to antitrust enforcement in the United States based, in part, on the belief that market forces would correct imbalances better.</p><p>The Chicago School has greased the wheels for the megamergers that have reshaped many industries while providing the intellectual justification for why today\u2019s tech giants are not dangerous monopolies. It\u2019s hard to argue that Google\u2019s or Facebook\u2019s market power is hurting prices when their products do not cost money and Amazon \u2014 while not free \u2014 is celebrated for its convenience and prices.</p><p>Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the Booth School of Business with Mr. Zingales, said he still didn\u2019t see a serious alternative to the Chicago School for formulating antitrust policy. He also said there was little evidence that more regulation led to better outcomes for consumers.</p><p>\u201cMost of what I see from companies like Amazon, Google and Apple is that they are successful because they do well in the competitive battle,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThe difference between him and I is that he sees a failure of competition, whereas I see the success of the companies.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Murphy said, however, that there was not a monolithic view among the university\u2019s faculty, especially since many of the professors hadn\u2019t been trained at the University of Chicago.</p><p>\u201cThey would probably agree more with what Luigi is saying compared to what I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Mr. Zingales said the tech industry\u2019s network-driven business models \u2014 based on the notion that a service or a product becomes more useful and valuable as more people rely on it \u2014 was a relatively new area of study for economics.</p><p>Powerful monopolies like Google are a potential threat to democracy, Mr. Zingales added, because they hold so much sway over what we read. Google declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Zingales also noted that the ideology failed to capture the risk of a monopoly\u2019s exerting influence to persuade regulators and politicians.</p><p>In his address, Mr. Zingales implored the graduates to push back against today\u2019s tech behemoths, just as the colonists had resisted the monopoly of Britain\u2019s East India Company during the Boston Tea Party. He urged the audience to vote for politicians willing to stand up to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\u201cThis country was born fighting monopolies,\u201d said Mr. Zingales, who still speaks with a noticeable Italian accent. \u201cTo fight monopolies, your power as workers, consumers and investors is not sufficient. Your participation in the political process is critical. This is not a Republican or Democratic battle. It\u2019s an American battle.\u201d</p><p>Then he addressed the elephant in the room.</p><p>\u201cMy conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a method of intellectual inquiry without the blinders imposed by conventional wisdom.\u201d</p><p>Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka. </p><p>PHOTOS: Professor Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago is calling for an evolving position on antitrust thinking.

We are using Google hangouts to chat as a group - and getting a fascinating insight into everyone's homes and chosen leisurewear at the same time.</p><p>If anything, communication has improved. Perhaps it is the fact that the awkwardness of crossing the office to talk to someone hidden behind their computer has been removed, or maybe we are simply trying to relieve the boredom of isolation, but the upshot seems to be more sharing of ideas as a team (albeit digitally). The distance between our colleagues overseas or those who regularly work remotely doesn't feel quite so far when no one is in the office.</p><p>The biggest hurdles in the remote productionof a magazine lie in the sourcing of economic data and checking pages before they go to the printers. The Bloomberg terminal that we use for timely financial data doesn't easily permit remote access (unsurprisingly, it's a \u00a320,000 product and the company needs to protect it) and Slack doesn't allow for annotation of scanned documents. The printing presses also need people to man them and we need drivers for distribution.</p><p>But we have put out a magazine and podcast without a member of the IC team having to step foot in the office for over two weeks and will continue to do so for as long as possible during this whole sorry saga.</p><p>The IC is not the only company to have recently discovered that working from home is easier than expected. With around a fifth of the world's population currently in government-mandated lockdown, including some of the busiest cities, many millions of people are staying away from their offices.</p><p>This has been reflected in a big increase in demand for remote working tools. Microsoft (US:MSFT) reported that daily active users on its Teams instant messaging service had surged to 44m, with 12m new accounts added in one week. Slack, Zoom (US:ZOOM) and Google are also experiencing higher usage as businesses, schools and universities connect digitally. Demand for cybersecurity products and training has also spiked as experts expose phishing attacks by cybercriminals preying on people's panic.</p><p>Remote working is not a new concept. Improvements in telecoms networks and computer software, alongside calls for better workplace flexibility, means the number of homeworkers has increased by 27 per cent in the UK in the past decade. But, last May, the Trades Union Congress said the move to flexi-working had been too slow, with not enough employers giving their staff the option to work remotely on a frequent basis. Coronavirus might have changed that. The last few weeks have proved that major organisations can operate successfully without a physical presence in the office or the need for excessive domestic and overseas travel. With the practicalities of home-working now better understood, the trend is likely to continue once the danger of a deadly virus has passed.</p><p>                     CASE STUDY: A software giant to ride out coronavirus                   </p><p>Few companies are benefiting from coronavirus; indeed, we would be very wary ofthose that are saying that they are. But it is hard to ignore the potential boost the current turbulence might offer Microsoft.</p><p>In addition to its Teams instant messaging software, which has been in high demand from companies and cities in lockdown, the company boasts the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure in the world. More remote working leads to demands for more data storage, which will directly benefit the biggest cloud providers.</p><p>Microsoft is not only logistically well placed to survive coronavirus, but has the financial strength to help it through the challenges as well. The company ended 2019 with $134bn (\u00a3108bn) of gross cash and net cash of $55bn - double annual operating expenses. Bill Gates always said he wanted his company to have enough money in the bank to allow it to continue running even if its customers didn't pay for a year. That mentality has never proved quite so important as it does today - other companies could learn from it. MB</p><p>But there are big industries that cannot function remotely. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing require a physical presence, as do emergency workers, utility providers and travel operators. For now, while isolation measures keep all but key workers confined to their homes, there is little these organisations can do but shut up shop and wait for the storm to pass.</p><p>But, for many of them, their place of work might change permanently as a result of the shift to more flexi-working. There will be less demand for train, bus and taxi drivers if we are not commuting as often. Offices won't need as many desks, meeting rooms or support staff. Pubs, restaurants and cafes that rely on the trade of lunchtime punters in busy cities might see custom decline if people are working remotely more often. Many of the job cuts in these businesses - for now a temporary measure to preserve cash - are likely to become more permanent.</p><p>And it is not just working life that has evolved almost beyond recognition as we take shelter from coronavirus. Even before the enforced closure of pubs, restaurants and bars in the UK, many Brits were staying away from crowded spaces for fear of infection. Cinemas, theme parks and shops have all closed their doors to protect staff and customers. Gyms and pools are empty, while demand for home workout equipment has risen so high that Mike Ashley attempted to claim Sports Direct (SPD) employees were key workers, delivering vital workout equipment in the UK.</p><p>                     CASE STUDY: Fitness moves forward                   </p><p>As vast swathes of the population get used to working from home, it seems highly likely that many of us will work out from home, too - accelerating a shift towards tech-enabled fitness platforms. The market agrees. Shares in indoor cycling brand Peloton (US:PTON) - which floated last autumn - have been relatively resilient since the early days of the global coronavirus outbreak. At the time of writing, the stock's value had contracted by just 9 per cent over the past three months. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index had fallen by more than a fifth.</p><p>Bullish investors appear to be hoping that Peloton's huge expenditure on sales and marketing - $324m for the year to June 2019, on revenues of $915m - will translate into long-term subscriptions that may improve visibility. But there are reasons to remain cynical. The group's high-end equipment is very expensive and squeezing a sizeable piece of kit into the living room is not an option that will be open to everyone. Moreover, first-mover advantage may not be enough for Peloton. In response to the current crisis, other, cheaper, fitness companies are stepping into the digital fray.</p><p>To that point, low-cost operator The Gym Group (GYM) - London's only listed gym company - has seen its shares crash by more than a half since the start of 2020. But the group's website now advertises 'epic workouts from your home' in partnership with 'Fiit' - the number-one rated fitness app in Apple's (US:AAPL) App Store. Meanwhile, in America, affordable club provider Planet Fitness (US:PLNT) is giving everyone daily free 'home work-ins' via Facebook (US:FB). And, among numerous other examples, private entity Barry's Bootcamp is running live classes via Instagram.</p><p>Peloton has extended the free trial for its app to 90 days, \"as daily routines continue to change\". But the allure of physical gyms and sports centres is not going to disappear overnight - nor over several months. The social element of such sites, and the sophisticated machinery on offer, are very difficult to replicate at home. Temporary closure at the hands of Covid-19 has led some of these businesses to connect with their followers in new ways - extending their online capabilities to see themselves through a period of unprecedented disruption. Done well, this could leave them better placed in the long run. HC</p><p>Students at both school and university are finding ways to keep themselves active thanks partly to Joe Wicks' online PE lessons. Tech is keeping teachers connected to their students across all subjects, but the challenges of disciplining a virtual class suggests schools will probably return to normal as soon as possible. Higher education might be a different matter. Students graduating this summer will have earned their degrees with very little face-to-face contact with lecturers, further undermining the justification for expensive tuition fees. Higher education is a sector ripe for disruption - perhaps some of the big tech companies that have provided learning tools during the period of lockdown will continue to shake up the market.</p><p>To entertain ourselves from the safety of our homes, we are turning to the virtual world: streaming, gaming and FaceTiming are filling the time that was once occupied by trips to cinemas, bowling alleys and pubs. Online grocery shopping has become so popular that Ocado (OCDO) had to pause new orders for a few days to deal with the huge demand. Consumers are turning to e-commerce more than ever - at least until a lack of personal protection equipment and mounting health fears force warehouses and fulfilment centres to send their staff home. The demand has even put pressure on Amazon's (US:AMZN) famous logistics - next-day deliveries are a rare and precious gift for Prime members during coronavirus lockdown.</p><p>                     CASE STUDY: Entertainment opportunities in isolation                   </p><p>Lockdown measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic are proving a double-edged sword for media and entertainment companies. The crisis hit at an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/03/13/cineworld-s-coronavirus-horror-story/\">inopportune time for Cineworld</url>(CINE), already steeped in debt and funding the $2bn acquisition of Canadian cinema chain Cineplex. Even in countries where theatres remain open, it will have difficulty attracting cinephiles as potential blockbusters such as the new James Bond film are postponed. The group has modelled a scenario where it could lose two to three months of revenue and breach its financial covenants.</p><p>Our penchant for streaming has been exacerbated by the 'cocooning effect' of the mass shut-in, ramping up competition between the likes of Netflix (US:NFLX), Amazon's Prime Video and Apple's TV+. According to network services provider Wurl, time spent streaming rose 14 per cent in the UK over the weekend of 14-15 March. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/03/13/cineworld-s-coronavirus-horror-story/\">IC buy tip Disney</url>(US:DIS) has seemingly chosen the perfect time to launch Disney+ in the UK. But there is the lingering question of subscriber growth beyond this crisis - if you don't sign up now, are you likely to ever?</p><p>Pronouncing the death of cinema may be hyperbolic, but this crisis could permanently change how content is consumed. As box-office sales plunge, NBCUniversal is releasing new films via on-demand services. Meanwhile the 'Netflix Party' extension on Google's Chrome browser has enabled 'virtual cinemas'. With home televisions marching towards 8K ultra-high resolution, cinema could prove less resilient post-coronavirus than other live events. The food, music and culture markets provided by Time Out (TMO) are less easily replicated at home, but the group has warned on its ability to survive the current upheaval.</p><p>Video gaming's ascent has also been turbocharged by Covid-19, a likely boon for developers such as ActivisionBlizzard(US:ATVI) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/03/13/cineworld-s-coronavirus-horror-story/\">IC buy tip Codemasters</url>(CDM). Activision launched its Call of Duty: Warzone battle royale on 10 March, drawing 6m global players on its first day - it has now amassed more than 30m users. The popularity of live video game streaming on Twitch is also another feather in Amazon's cap. Gaming is proving so popular it is even straining internet infrastructure around the world.</p><p>But more screen time isn't translating to profit for all. ITV (ITV) says its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/tips-ideas/2020/03/13/cineworld-s-coronavirus-horror-story/\">advertising revenue could slump</url> 10 per cent in April as companies defer marketing expenditure. Last year's 1.5 per cent decline was driven by political and economic uncertainty, and the Covid-19 impact on 2020 could be worse, compounded by the delay to big, lucrative events such as Euro 2020. STV (STVG) has also said its single-digit growth target for regional advertising revenue this year could prove a stretch. Not even the giants are immune. While messaging across Facebook's platforms is up over 50 per cent, it has cited \"a weakening in our ads business\" and it's a similar story for Twitter(US:TWTR).</p><p>This demonstrates that the best investment opportunities in entertainment lie in companies not just drawing new eyes but monetising them. As things stand, the smart money is on streaming and gaming. NK</p><p>Unsurprisingly, high streets are eerily quiet - the shuttered shops providing a frightening glimpse into the potential future of town centres. When John Lewis shut its flagship store on Oxford Street earlier in March, images circulated on Twitter depicting the burned-out shell of the building after it was bombed in World War II alongside the caption: 'If we survived the war, we can survive coronavirus.' But in the 1940s John Lewis wasn't facing the additional pressure of an increasingly digital world. The high street's demise has been anticipated for many years as demand for e-commerce has rocketed. Coronavirus may be the catalyst that kills off high streets for good.</p><p>It is tough to say with any certainty that our coronavirus-enforced behaviour is set to become the new normal. For now, all companies can do is hunker down and await the end of the storm. However, one trend that should emerge from the current crisis is the need for better financial management. Companies that have relied on cheap debt to satisfy shareholders' growth ambitions now find themselves at the mercy of expensive government bailouts - that is no way to run a business.</p><p>Well-managed companies, which are not over-leveraged and have truly strong balance sheets, should be best placed to emerge from the crisis unscathed. But bigger challenges might face certain sectors if the world that awaits them on the other side of coronavirus is indeed different to the one they left behind.</p><p>                                            Property: a                        multi-sector shift                                        </p><p>Rent is a fixed cost for most businesses. But what if, in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown, some employers realise that they are able to cope without so much office space? For the UK's large office landlords - Derwent London (DLN), Helical (HLCL), Great Portland (GPOR) and CLS (CLS) - a reduction in demand for floor space could spark a decline in net rental income, which would lower the investment yields attached to their assets. </p><p>The potential fallout could be made worse by the fact that many of these landlords have been increasingly leasing space to flexible workspace groups, such as IWG (IWG) and WeWork. Demand for these could drop if staff can work from the comfort of their homes. Admittedly, a reduction in demand would not be immediately apparent, given leases are typically signed on a long-term basis of several years. For example, Derwent's lease with The Office Group was signed in 2015 for a term of 20 years. But, beyond that, the future suddenly looks a lot less certain than it did only a few weeks ago.</p><p>Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, the UK's office market was in a robust position. The ever-expanding skyline of the City of London stands testament to the increased investment in the sector in recent years. In March, the average investment yield stood at 4 per cent for prime offices in the capital, according to data from Knight Frank. However, the sector may already have been primed for a correction. During the first half of last year, 11 per cent of rent generated by the UK's offices was greater than the open-market value. That is higher than the retail and industrial sectors and suggests the market was already at risk of over-renting.</p><p>In the retail property market, unnerving trends - rising e-commerce and lower high-street footfall - have been worryingly accelerated by the coronavirus. In the wake of widespread closures of hospitality venues and shops, the government has said that tenants will be protected from eviction if they miss rent payments for the next three months. While that eases immediate pressure on the retailers, the burden falls on commercial landlords.</p><p>That burden could get even more pressing if retailers and restaurants begin to go out of business, thus leaving even more high-street premises vacant. Filling empty properties isn't going to be easy as we emerge from coronavirus, and the market they served has moved on - or stays at home. EP</p><p>                                            Banks: a reset or continued                       decline?                                        </p><p>Forecasting the impact of the coronavirus on the banking system is not an easy task.</p><p>For a start, no one knows how long the economy will remain on ice, which means it is impossible to say when banks might profitably lend again. Second, until countries start to get a handle on the pandemic, there remains a serious risk that the profound shocks to economic activity, capital markets, businesses and households could spill over into liquidity issues within the financial system. According to one recent survey, up to a fifth of the UK's 5m small firms could run out of cash in the next four weeks, despite government schemes.</p><p>The market in which this crisis started may have sold live animals rather than toxic derivatives, but the scale of the current predicament still has the capacity to overwhelm the balance sheets of major lenders, just as the banking crisis did in 2008. And if there's one lesson from the last major market crash, it is that distress in just one financial institution can result in wide and unpredictable domino effects.</p><p>There are some things we can say with greater certainty: in the immediate term, the coronavirus means colossal operational disruption. Investment plans have been suspended and products have been pulled as the demand for customer support has soared. Last week, faced with the disruption of a quarantined workforce, HSBC (HSBA) hit pause on its attempts to conduct what chief executive Noel Quinn described as one of the \"deepest restructuring programmes\" in the bank's history.</p><p>It also means this year's financial statements are going to be very ugly. OneSavings Bank (OSB), the largest listed domestic lender to report since the Covid-19 crisis took hold in the UK, said the pandemic could adversely impact the asset quality of its loans, lending volumes, funding sources, service quality and operational capacity. Candidly, OSB also flagged the \"increased propensity for human error owing to a reduced and stretched workforce\" - which is always a concern within complex systems such as finance.</p><p>Elsewhere, the current crisis looks set to hasten other pre-existing trends. As millions of customers adapt to life without the high street, the expensive branch-based service model pursued by Metro Bank (MTRO) looks even more redundant. The greatest working from home experiment in history will also embolden the efforts of bank chief technology officers to digitise.</p><p>Could an accelerated shift to leaner processes prove to be one silver lining? After all, the need to cut costs has long been seen by many analysts as the only real opportunity for UK banking to improve its profitability.</p><p>Set in the broader market context, it seems doubtful. Between the income-eroding impact of near-zero interest rates, and the quasi-governmental role banks are rightly being asked to play amid the current turmoil, it's hard to see what should attract equity investors to UK lenders for some time - especially now that banks have bowed to regulatory pressure and scrapped their dividends. AN</p><p>                                            A catalyst                        for fintech?                                         </p><p>Elsewhere in the finance industry, coronavirus might fast-track a burgeoning trend. This year had been earmarked as the year for an acceleration in the use of financial technology before the coronavirus sparked a decline in cash circulation, a surge in online shopping and a rise in contactless payments. </p><p>Now, even more people have been willing to embrace digital payments as they try to side-step potentially-contaminated surfaces. Cash payments have halved as consumers stay away from shops and on 1 April the limit for contactless payments in the UK was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345 to help people avoid pin pads. These trends are unlikely to reverse once the threat of coronavirus lifts.</p><p>Meanwhile, digital purchases of goods and services has spiked. In its recent financial results, UK group Boku (BOKU), which provides software that facilitates online payments for merchants, said that it had seen increases in new users of its payments platform this year, especially for streaming video services and gaming in countries that have been hit hardest by the virus. </p><p>For now, Visa (US:V) and Mastercard (US:MA), the titans in the sector, are struggling with an overall decline in spending. The medium-term outlook for both companies has been disrupted by a decline in cross-border payments - a key driver of profits. It is the same tale on our own shores: Network International (NETW) said it had seen a reduction in client transaction volumes in recent weeks. Finablr (FIN) struck a similarly sombre tone in an update earlier this month, flagging that its cash flow and liquidity were under threat from travel restrictions, which have hurt foreign exchange and payment services - its auditor has now resigned. </p><p>But the outlook for these groups isn't nearly as terrifying as it is for cash-based companies. De La Rue (DLAR) had been struggling before the massive decline in cash payments sparked by the outbreak of coronavirus. The outlook for its currency business (77 per cent of 2019 revenues) is now bleaker than ever. LA</p><p>                                            Is coro                       navirus a stopper or an accelerant on the green revolution?                                         </p><p>One of the more welcome images from the coronavirus pandemic is the immediate relief on the natural environment. While we are confined to our homes, unable to travel for business or pleasure, the waters of Venice's polluted canals have run clear and skies are empty of vapour trails. Coronavirus is a timely reminder that we must do more to protect our environment.</p><p>So, will coronavirus curb our appetite for travel? A departure from flying to our holiday destinations seems unlikely. By the time we are freed from lockdown, many of us will have accumulated significant annual leave and enough savings to fund an extravagant trip. InterContinental Hotels (IHG) has already experienced improvements in room occupancy levels in China, where the pandemic appears to be receding. For now, uncertainty over the future of holidaying hangs on the survival of suppliers, not the revival of its demand.</p><p>However, business travel is another matter. While UK residents' demand for international tourism rose for the best part of the last decade, they made about 1.4m fewer business trips abroad in 2018 compared with 1998, according to the Office for National Statistics. Technology has already lessened the need to fly to meetings. In 1998, Concorde took us from London to New York in around three hours; Microsoft can take us there in seconds. Reducing business travel might be the most attractive way of reducing our carbon footprint in a post-coronavirus world. AJ</p><p>                     Sustainability could suffer                   </p><p>But then there's the oil price crash, which makes green initiatives - including reduced flying and a rise in electric vehicles - seem less attractive. Cheaper oil could also see investors and fossil fuel companies forget their previous plans to cut emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has pleaded with governments to keep climate in mind in financial stimulus packages, but the short-term impacts on new renewable projects will be rough. </p><p>Wood Mackenzie analyst Valentina Kretzschmar said plans made at $60 (\u00a351) a barrel would not necessarily stick at $30 a barrel. \"The sector will struggle to generate enough cash to maintain operations and honour shareholder commitments,\" she said. </p><p>The short-term outlook for renewables spending is not attractive. WoodMac has forecast a 6 per cent drop in wind additions so far this year, with more possibly to come as factories in Europe close. The upcoming auctions and tenders in Europe, South Africa and China could all be postponed, cutting into added capacity in the coming years. In the short term, cheaper oil makes cutting emissions tougher. \"Without measures by governments, cheaper energy always leads consumers to use it less efficiently,\" according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. \"It reduces the appeal of buying more efficient cars or retrofitting homes and offices to save energy.\" </p><p>The oil oversupply - caused by both a drop in demand from Covid-19 mitigation measures and Saudi Arabia pumping up supply over a disagreement with Russia - will have upsides for renewable energy investment however, according to Dr Kretzschmar. Using a medium-term price of $35 a barrel, she said the returns on pre-green-light oil projects fall and make investment in renewable projects look like a safer bet. \"With a weighted average return of 6 per cent IRR [internal rate of return], oil and gas projects are now in line with average returns from low-risk solar and wind projects,\" she said. AH</p><p>                     A caveat                   </p><p>This article has been written after two weeks of isolation and the novelty of home-working is now starting to wear thin. True, the longer the lockdown goes on the greater the damage inflicted on the global economy; but, also, the more desperate we will be to return to our old habits. The way we used to live may become normal again and coronavirus could eventually become a distant blip in the global landscape with no lasting repercussions. But somehow, we doubt it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-61770010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJY-6KX1-JCJY-G0TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4486\"/><timeReceived>5:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Then, I expected perhaps a couple of days of working from home while the panic blew over. I didn't genuinely believe that I would be facing several months of working from my kitchen table, furiously fighting the urge to binge (food and Netflix) and desperately trying to scrape together a semblance of routine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But - aside from the fact that I am missing my colleagues and we are all very worried about the state we will find our favourite lunch spots in when we finally get back to the office - working from home has proved a better experience than expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Investors Chronicle (and Financial Times as a whole) is using a mixture of the services provided by Slack (US:WORK) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) to communicate. Every morning we open a shared Google document to discuss the news. We are using Google hangouts to chat as a group - and getting a fascinating insight into everyone's homes and chosen leisurewear at the same time.</p><p>If anything, communication has improved. Perhaps it is the fact that the awkwardness of crossing the office to talk to someone hidden behind their computer has been removed, or maybe we are simply trying to relieve the boredom of isolation, but the upshot seems to be more sharing of ideas as a team (albeit digitally). The distance between our colleagues overseas or those who regularly work remotely doesn't feel quite so far when no one is in the office.</p><p>The biggest hurdles in the remote production of a magazine lie in the sourcing of economic data and checking pages before they go to the printers. The Bloomberg terminal that we use for timely financial data doesn't easily permit remote access (unsurprisingly, it's a \u00a320,000 product and the company needs to protect it) and Slack doesn't allow for annotation of scanned documents. The printing presses also need people to man them and we need drivers for distribution.</p><p>But we have put out a magazine and podcast without a member of the IC team having to step foot in the office for over two weeks and will continue to do so for as long as possible during this whole sorry saga.</p><p>The IC is not the only company to have recently discovered that working from home is easier than expected. With around a fifth of the world's population currently in government-mandated lockdown, including some of the busiest cities, many millions of people are staying away from their offices.</p><p>This has been reflected in a big increase in demand for remote working tools. Microsoft (US:MSFT) reported that daily active users on its Teams instant messaging service had surged to 44m, with 12m new accounts added in one week. Slack, Zoom (US:ZOOM) and Google are also experiencing higher usage as businesses, schools and universities connect digitally. Demand for cybersecurity products and training has also spiked as experts expose phishing attacks by cybercriminals preying on people's panic.</p><p>Remote working is not a new concept. Improvements in telecoms networks and computer software, alongside calls for better workplace flexibility, means the number of homeworkers has increased by 27 per cent in the UK in the past decade. But, last May, the Trades Union Congress said the move to flexi-working had been too slow, with not enough employers giving their staffthe option to work remotely on a frequent basis. Coronavirus might have changed that. The last few weeks have proved that major organisations can operate successfully without a physical presence in the office or the need for excessive domestic and overseas travel. With the practicalities of home-working now better understood, the trend is likely to continue once the danger of a deadly virus has passed.</p><p>Permanent change But there are big industries that cannot function remotely. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing require a physical presence, as do emergency workers, utility providers and travel operators. For now, while isolation measures keep all but key workers confined to their homes, there is little these organisations can do but shut up shop and wait for the storm to pass.</p><p>But, for many of them, their place of work might change permanently as a result of the shift to more flexi-working. There will be less demand for train, bus and taxi drivers if we are not commuting as often. Offices won't need as many desks, meeting rooms or support staff. Pubs, restaurants and cafes that rely on the trade of lunchtime punters in busy cities might see custom decline if people are working remotely more often. Many of the job cuts in these businesses - for now a temporary measure to preserve cash - are likely to become more permanent.</p><p>And it is not just working life that has evolved almost beyond recognition as we take shelter from coronavirus. Even before the enforced closure of pubs, restaurants and bars in the UK, many Brits were staying away from crowded spaces for fear of infection. Cinemas, theme parks and shops have all closed their doors to protect staffand customers. Gyms and pools are empty, while demand for home workout equipment has risen so high that Mike Ashley attempted to claim Sports Direct (SPD) employees were key workers, delivering vital workout equipment in the UK.</p><p>Students at both school and university are finding ways to keep themselves active thanks partly to Joe Wicks' online PE lessons. Tech is keeping teachers connected to their students across all subjects, but the challenges of disciplining a virtual class suggests schools will probably return to normal as soon as possible. Higher education might be a different matter. Students graduating this summer will have earned their degrees with very little face-to-face contact with lecturers, further undermining the justification for expensive tuition fees. Higher education is a sector ripe for disruption - perhaps some of the big tech companies that have provided learning tools during the period of lockdown will continue to shake up the market.</p><p>To entertain ourselves from the safety of our homes, we are turning to the virtual world: streaming, gaming and FaceTiming are filling the time that was once occupied by trips to cinemas, bowling alleys and pubs. Online grocery shopping has become so popular that Ocado (OCDO) had to pause new orders for a few days to deal with the huge demand. Consumers are turning to e-commerce more than ever - at least until a lack of personal protection equipment and mounting health fears force warehouses and fulfilment centres to send their staffhome. The demand has even put pressure on Amazon's (US:AMZN) famous logistics - next-day deliveries are a rare and precious gift for Prime members during coronavirus lockdown.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, high streets are eerily quiet - the shuttered shops providing a frightening glimpse into the potential future of town centres. When John Lewis shut its flagship store on Oxford Street earlier in March, images circulated on Twitter depicting the burned-out shell of the building after it was bombed in World War II alongside the caption: 'If we survived the war, we can survive coronavirus.' But in the 1940s John Lewis wasn't facing the additional pressure of an increasingly digital world. The high street's demise has been anticipated for many years as demand for e-commerce has rocketed. Coronavirus may be the catalyst that kills offhigh streets for good.</p><p>It is tough to say with any certainty that our coronavirus-enforced behaviour is set to become the new normal. For now, all companies can do is hunker down and await the end of the storm. However, one trend that should emerge from the current crisis is the need for better financial management. Companies that have relied on cheap debt to satisfy shareholders' growth ambitions now find themselves at the mercy of expensive government bailouts - that is no way to run a business. Well-managed companies, which are not overleveraged and have truly strong balance sheets, should be best placed to emerge from the crisis unscathed. But bigger challenges might face certain sectors if the world that awaits them on the other side of coronavirus is indeed different to the one they left behind.</p><p>PROPERTY: A MULTI-SECTOR SHIFT Rent is a fixed cost for most businesses. But what if, in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown, some employers realise that they are able to cope without so much office space? For the UK's large office landlords - Derwent London (DLN), Helical (HLCL), Great Portland (GPOR) and CLS (CLS) - a reduction in demand for floorspace could spark a decline in net rental income, which would lower the investment yields attached to their assets.</p><p>The potential fallout could be made worse by the fact that many of these landlords have been increasingly leasing space to flexible workspace groups, such as IWG (IWG) and WeWork. Demand for these could drop if staffcan work from the comfort of their homes. Admittedly, a reduction in demand would not be immediately apparent, given leases are typically signed on a long-term basis of several years. For example, Derwent's lease with The Office Group was signed in 2015 for a term of 20 years. But, beyond that, the future suddenly looks a lot less certain than it did only a few weeks ago.</p><p>Prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, the UK's office market was in a robust position. The ever-expanding skyline of the City of London stands testament to the increased investment in the sector in recent years. In March, the average investment yield stood at 4 per cent for prime offices in the capital, according to data from Knight Frank. However, the sector may already have been primed for a correction. During the first half of last year, 11 per cent of rent generated by the UK's offices was greater than the open-market value. That is higher than the retail and industrial sectors and suggests the market was already at risk of over-renting. In the retail property market, unnerving trends - rising e-commerce and lower high-street footfall - have been worryingly accelerated by the coronavirus. In the wake of widespread closures of hospitality venues and shops, the government has said that tenants will be protected from eviction if they miss rent payments for the next three months. While that eases immediate pressure on the retailers, the burden falls on commercial landlords.</p><p>That burden could get even more pressing if retailers and restaurants begin to go out of business, thus leaving even more high-street premises vacant. Filling empty properties isn't going to be easy as we emerge from coronavirus, and the market they served has moved on - or stays at home. EP BANKS: A RESET OR CONTINUED DECLINE? Forecasting the impact of the coronavirus on the banking system is not an easy task.</p><p>For a start, no one knows how long the economy will remain on ice, which means it is impossible to say when banks might profitably lend again. Second, until countries start to get a handle on the pandemic, there remains a serious risk that the profound shocks to economic activity, capital markets, businesses and households could spill over into liquidity issues within the financial system. According to one recent survey, up to a fifth of the UK's 5m small firms could run out of cash in the next four weeks, despite government schemes.</p><p>The market in which this crisis started may have sold live animals rather than toxic derivatives, but the scale of the current predicament still has the capacity to overwhelm the balance sheets of major lenders, just as the banking crisis did in 2008. And if there's one lesson from the last major market crash, it is that distress in just one financial institution can result in wide and unpredictable domino effects.</p><p>There are some things we can say with greater certainty: in the immediate term, the coronavirus means colossal operational disruption. Investment plans have been suspended and products have been pulled as the demand for customer support has soared. Last week, faced with the disruption of a quarantined workforce, HSBC (HSBA) hit pause on its attempts to conduct what chief executive Noel Quinn described as one of the \"deepest restructuring programmes\" in the bank's history. It also means this year's financial statements are going to be very ugly. OneSavings Bank (OSB), the largest listed domestic lender to report since the Covid-19 crisis took hold in the UK, said the pandemic could adversely impact the asset quality of its loans, lending volumes, funding sources, service quality and operational capacity. Candidly, OSB also flagged the \"increased propensity for human error owing to a reduced and stretched workforce\" - which is always a concern within complex systems such as finance.</p><p>Elsewhere, the current crisis looks set to hasten other pre-existing trends. As millions of customers adapt to life without the high street, the expensive branch-based service model pursued by Metro Bank (MTRO) looks even more redundant. The greatest working from home experiment in history will also embolden the efforts of bank chief technology officers to digitise.</p><p>Could an accelerated shift to leaner processes prove to be one silver lining? After all, the need to cut costs has long been seen by many analysts as the only real opportunity for UK banking to improve its profitability.</p><p>Set in the broader market context, it seems doubtful. Between the income-eroding impact of near-zero interest rates, and the quasi-governmental role banks are rightly being asked to play amid the current turmoil, it's hard to see what should attract equity investors to UK lenders for some time - especially now that banks have bowed to regulatory pressure and scrapped their dividends. AN A CATALYST FOR FINTECH? Elsewhere in the finance industry, coronavirus might fast-track a burgeoning trend. This year had been earmarked as the year for an acceleration in the use of financial technology before the coronavirus sparked a decline in cash circulation, a surge in online shopping and a rise in contactless payments.</p><p>Now, even more people have been willing to embrace digital payments as they try to side-step potentially-contaminated surfaces. Cash payments have halved as consumers stay away from shops and on 1 April the limit for contactless payments in the UK was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345 to help people avoid pin pads. These trends are unlikely to reverse once the threat of coronavirus lifts.</p><p>Meanwhile, digital purchases of goods and services has spiked. In its recent financial results, UK group Boku (BOKU), which provides software that facilitates online payments for merchants, said that it had seen increases in new users of its payments platform this year, especially for streaming video services and gaming in countries that have been hit hardest by the virus.</p><p>For now, Visa (US:V) and Mastercard (US:MA), the titans in the sector, are struggling with an overall decline in spending. The medium-term outlook for both companies has been disrupted by a decline in cross-border payments - a key driver of profits. It is the same tale on our own shores: Network International (NETW) said it had seen a reduction in client transaction volumes in recent weeks. Finablr (FIN) struck a similarly sombre tone in an update earlier this month, flagging that its cash flow and liquidity were under threat from travel restrictions, which have hurt foreign exchange and payment services - its auditor has now resigned.</p><p>But the outlook for these groups isn't nearly as terrifying as it is for cash-based companies. De La Rue (DLAR) had been struggling before the massive decline in cash payments sparked by the outbreak of coronavirus. The outlook for its currency business (77 per cent of 2019 revenues) is now bleaker than ever. LA A STOPPER OR AN ACCELERANT ON THE GREEN REVOLUTION? One of the more welcome images from the coronavirus pandemic is the immediate relief on the natural environment. While we are confined to our homes, unable to travel for business or pleasure, the waters of Venice's polluted canals have run clear and skies are empty of vapour trails. Coronavirus is a timely reminder that we must do more to protect our environment.</p><p>So, will coronavirus curb our appetite for travel? A departure from flying to our holiday destinations seems unlikely. By the time we are freed from lockdown, many of us will have accumulated significant annual leave and enough savings to fund an extravagant trip. InterContinental Hotels (IHG) has already experienced improvements in room occupancy levels in China, where the pandemic appears to be receding. For now, uncertainty over the future of holidaying hangs on the survival of suppliers, not the revival of its demand.</p><p>However, business travel is another matter. While UK residents' demand for international tourism rose for the best part of the last decade, they made about 1.4m fewer business trips abroad in 2018 compared with 1998, according to the Office for National Statistics. Technology has already lessened the need to fly to meetings. In 1998, Concorde took us from London to New York in around three hours; Microsoft can take us there in seconds. Reducing business travel might be the most attractive way of reducing our carbon footprint in a post-coronavirus world. AJ Sustainability could suffer But then there's the oil price crash, which makes green initiatives - including reduced flying and a rise in electric vehicles - seem less attractive. Cheaper oil could also see investors and fossil fuel companies forget their previous plans to cut emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has pleaded with governments to keep climate in mind in financial stimulus packages, but the short-term impacts on new renewable projects will be rough.</p><p>Wood Mackenzie analyst Valentina Kretzschmar said plans made at $60 (\u00a351) a barrel would not necessarily stick at $30 a barrel. \"The sector will struggle to generate enough cash to maintain operations and honour shareholder commitments,\" she said.</p><p>The short-term outlook for renewables spending is not attractive. WoodMac has forecast a 6 per cent drop in wind additions so far this year, with more possibly to come as factories in Europe close. The upcoming auctions and tenders in Europe, South Africa and China could all be postponed, cutting into added capacity in the coming years. In the short term, cheaper oil makes cutting emissions tougher. \"Without measures by governments, cheaper energy always leads consumers to use it less efficiently,\" according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. \"It reduces the appeal of buying more efficient cars or retrofitting homes and offices to save energy.\"</p><p>The oil oversupply - caused by both a drop in demand from Covid-19 mitigation measures and Saudi Arabia pumping up supply over a disagreement with Russia - will have upsides for renewable energy investment however, according to Dr Kretzschmar. Using a medium-term price of $35 a barrel, she said the returns on pre-green-light oil projects fall and make investment in renewable projects look like a safer bet. \"With a weighted average return of 6 per cent IRR [internal rate of return], oil and gas projects are now in line with average returns from low-risk solar and wind projects,\" she said. AH A caveat This article has been written after two weeks of isolation and the novelty of home-working is now starting to wear thin. True, the longer the lockdown goes on the greater the damage inflicted on the global economy; but, also, the more desperate we will be to return to our old habits. The way we used to live may become normal again and coronavirus could eventually become a distant blip in the global landscape with no lasting repercussions. But somehow, we doubt it.</p><p>Case study: Entertainment opportunities in isolation</p><p>Lockdown measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic are proving a double-edged sword for media and entertainment companies. The crisis hit at an inopportune time for Cineworld (CINE), already steeped in debt and funding the $2bn acquisition of Canadian cinema chain Cineplex. Even in countries where theatres remain open, it will have difficulty attracting cinephiles as potential blockbusters such as the new James Bond film are postponed. The group has modelled a scenario where it could lose two to three months of revenue and breach its financial covenants. Our penchant for streaming has been exacerbated by the 'cocooning effect' of the mass shut-in, ramping up competition between the likes of Netflix (US:NFLX), Amazon's Prime Video and Apple's TV+. According to network services provider Wurl, time spent streaming rose 14 per cent in the UK over the weekend of 14-15</p><p>March. IC buy tip Disney (US:DIS) has seemingly chosen the perfect time to launch Disney+ in the UK. But there is the lingering question of subscriber growth beyond this crisis - if you don't sign up now, are you likely to ever? Pronouncing the death of cinema may be hyperbolic, but this crisis could permanently change how content is consumed. As box-office sales plunge, NBCUniversal is releasing new films via on-demand services. Meanwhile, the 'Netflix Party' extension on Google's Chrome browser has enabled 'virtual cinemas'. With home televisions marching towards 8K ultra-high resolution, cinema could prove less resilient post-coronavirus than other live events. The food,</p><p>music and culture markets provided by Time Out (TMO) are less easily replicated at home, but the group has warned on its ability to survive the current upheaval. Video gaming's ascent has also been turbocharged by Covid-19, a likely boon for developers such as Activision Blizzard (US:ATVI) and IC buy tip Codemasters (CDM). Activision launched its Call of Duty: Warzonebattle royale on 10 March, drawing 6m global players on its first day - it has now amassed more than 30m users. The popularity of live video game streaming on Twitch is also another feather in Amazon's cap. Gaming is proving so popular it is even straining internet infrastructure around the world.</p><p>But more screen time isn't translating to profit for all. ITV (ITV) says its advertising revenue could slump by 10 per cent in April as companies defer marketing expenditure. Last year's 1.5 per cent decline was driven by political and economic uncertainty, and the Covid-19 impact on 2020 could be worse, compounded by the delay of big, lucrative events such as Euro 2020. STV (STVG) has also said its single-digit growth target for regional advertising revenue this year could prove a stretch. Not even the giants are immune. While messaging across Facebook's platforms is up over 50 per cent, it has cited \"a weakening in our ads business\" and it's a similar story for Twitter (US:TWTR). This demonstrates that the best investment opportunities in entertainment lie in companies not just drawing new eyes but monetising them. As things stand, the smart money is on streaming and gaming. NK</p><p>Case study: Fitness moves forward</p><p>As vast swathes of the population get used to working from home, it seems highly likely that many of us will work out from home, too - accelerating a shift towards tech-enabled fitness platforms. The market agrees. Shares in indoor cycling brand Peloton (US:PTON) - which floated last autumn - have been relatively resilient since the early days of the global coronavirus outbreak. At the time of writing, the stock's value had contracted by just 9 per cent over the past three months. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index had fallen by more than a fifth. Bullish investors appear to be hoping that Peloton's huge expenditure on sales and marketing - $324m for the year to June 2019, on revenues of $915m - will translate into long-term subscriptions that may improve visibility. But there are reasons to remain cynical. The group's high-end equipment is very expensive and squeezing a sizeable piece of kit into the living room is not an option that will be open to everyone. Moreover, first-mover advantage may not be enough for Peloton. In response to the current crisis, other, cheaper, fitness companies are stepping into the digital fray. To that point, low-cost operator The</p><p>Gym Group (GYM) - London's only listed gym company - has seen its shares crash by more than a half since the start of 2020. But the group's website now advertises 'epic workouts from your home' in partnership with 'Fiit' - the number-one rated fitness app in Apple's (US:AAPL) App Store. Meanwhile, in America, affordable club provider Planet Fitness (US:PLNT) is giving everyone daily free 'home work-ins' via Facebook (US:FB). And, among numerous other examples, private entity Barry's Bootcamp is running live classes via Instagram. Peloton has extended the free trial for its app to 90 days, \"as daily routines continue to change\". But the allure of physical gyms and sports centres is not going to disappear overnight - nor over several months. The social element of such sites, and the sophisticated machinery on offer, are very difficult to replicate at home. Temporary closure at the hands of Covid-19 has led some of these businesses to connect with their followers in new ways - extending their online capabilities to see themselves through a period of unprecedented disruption. Done well, this could leave them better placed in the long run. HC</p><p>Case study: A software giant to ride out coronavirus</p><p>Few companies are benefiting from coronavirus; indeed, we would be very wary of those that are saying that they are. But it is hard to ignore the potential boost the current turbulence might offer Microsoft. In addition to its Teams instant messaging software, which has been in high demand from companies and cities in lockdown, the company boasts the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure in the world. More remote working leads to demands for more data storage, which will directly benefit the biggest cloud providers.</p><p>Microsoft is not only logistically well placed to survive coronavirus, but has the financial strength to help it through the challenges as well. The company ended 2019 with $134bn (\u00a3108bn) of gross cash and net cash of $55bn - double annual operating expenses. Bill Gates always said he wanted his company to have enough money in the bank to allow it to continue running even if its customers didn't pay for a year. That mentality has never proved quite so important as it does today - other companies could learn from it.

And one of world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq exchange, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs. And as this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive, invite only Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. It's currently more valuable than Telstra, the corporate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes' and co-founder Scott Farquhar's multi-billion dollar fortunes each sit comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes said in a phone call this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things here.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic. Yet another striking illustration of a theme that is increasingly pervasive: Technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least corporate strategy and internal deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the dealmaker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in expensive suits and pounding the table in oak-pannelled boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Dealmakers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals. The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in the US is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all. Yet the broader trend is unmistakeable.</p><p>None of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>The shift from finance to tech is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened banks profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates do return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has now truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520153971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-TV91-DY19-C1VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>07:59 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And one of world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq exchange, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs. And as this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive, invite only Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. It's currently more valuable than Telstra, the corproate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes' and co-founder Scott Farquhar's multi-billion dollar fortunes each sit comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes said in a phone call this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things here.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic. Yet another striking illustration of a theme that is increasingly pervasive: Technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least corporate strategy and internal deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the dealmaker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in expensive suits and pounding the table in oak-pannelled boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Dealmakers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals. The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in the US is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all. Yet the broader trend is unmistakeable.</p><p>None of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>The shift from finance to tech is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened banks profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates do return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has now truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520153971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ6-H611-DY19-C4HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And one of world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq exchange, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs. And as this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive, invite only Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. It's currently more valuable than Telstra, the corproate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes' and co-founder Scott Farquhar's multi-billion dollar fortunes each sit comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes said in a phone call this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things here.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic. Yet another striking illustration of a theme that is increasingly pervasive: Technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least corporate strategy and internal deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the dealmaker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in expensive suits and pounding the table in oak-pannelled boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Dealmakers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals. The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in the US is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all. Yet the broader trend is unmistakeable.</p><p>None of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>The shift from finance to tech is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened banks profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates do return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has now truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520153971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-GM21-DY19-C16N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And one of world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq exchange, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs. And as this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive, invite only Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. It's currently more valuable than Telstra, the corproate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes' and co-founder Scott Farquhar's multi-billion dollar fortunes each sit comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes said in a phone call this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things here.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic. Yet another striking illustration of a theme that is increasingly pervasive: Technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least corporate strategy and internal deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the dealmaker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in expensive suits and pounding the table in oak-pannelled boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Dealmakers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals. The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in the US is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all. Yet the broader trend is unmistakeable.</p><p>None of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>The shift from finance to tech is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened banks profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates do return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has now truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520153971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ6-H611-DY19-C4J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And one of the world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for 25 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq index, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs.</p><p>As this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. In other words, it's more valuable than Telstra, the corporate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes (and co-founder Scott Farquhar's) fortune sits comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes told me in a phone call on the sidelines of the event this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic to me. Yet another striking illustration of a theme I see everywhere: technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least internal corporate strategy and deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the deal maker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in double-breasted suits and pounding the oak table in the boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Deal makers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals.</p><p>The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in Idaho is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all.</p><p>Also, none of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now it is in the ascendancy. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles, and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies.</p><p>The shift from finance tech is real and unmistakeable though. And it is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened the banks' profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to not just operate, but thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is likely top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc76685861poj39ld5842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ6-H9H1-F0J6-J2CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DF0F</classCode><className>ATLASSIAN PTY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002KMU</classCode><className>ALLEN &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

And one of the world's biggest investment banks, Deutsche Bank, began a significant retreat from Australia, where it has held a strong presence for 25 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin developments justifiably created a huge stir within the investment community. Such that another, perhaps equally significant business development, almost slipped by unnoticed.</p><p>Across the Pacific Ocean on the Nasdaq index, shares in Australia's most prominent tech company Atlassian hit fresh highs.</p><p>As this took place, co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and News Corp scion Lachlan Murdoch at the ultra-exclusive Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>The share surge means Atlassian is a now a $50 billion company. In other words, it's more valuable than Telstra, the corporate icon Grounds helped float on the stockmarket, in what he described this week as one of his most memorable deals. It also means Cannon-Brookes (and co-founder Scott Farquhar's) fortune sits comfortably ahead of James Packer's - a corporate icon himself, and Grounds' most famous client.</p><p>\"It's a surreal place to be for sure,\" Cannon-Brookes told me in a phone call on the sidelines of the event this week, referring to the rise of Atlassian. \"But we are here. And I think we deserve to be here.\"</p><p>Now, as someone who started his career in finance (including a brief stint on a Deutsche Bank trading floor) and ended up writing about technology and media, I acknowledge I may be reading too much into things.</p><p>But this week's events still felt highly symbolic to me. Yet another striking illustration of a theme I see everywhere: technology is becoming a more prominent function inside many companies than finance (or at least internal corporate strategy and deal-making departments). And tech is displacing finance as the dominant business sub-culture.</p><p>The era of the deal maker, and the industrial moguls they advise, dressed in double-breasted suits and pounding the oak table in the boardrooms has all but faded. It is being replaced by the age of the hoodie-clad venture capitalist, and the freewheeling, disruptive tech entrepreneur.</p><p>This theory is not perfect, of course. Deal makers and financiers are making a lot of money from tech, and tech moguls are doing a lot of deals.</p><p>The conference Cannon-Brookes and other tech figures attended this week in Idaho is hosted by a boutique investment bank, after all.</p><p>Also, none of this is to say that tech's ascendancy is leading us into an era that is necessarily better than what preceded it. The tech industry has its fair share of problems, which are only coming to light now it is in the ascendancy. The too-big-to-fail bank has been usurped by the ungovernable tech giant.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies, not to mention the impact of their products on society. Facebook and Google, in particular, are under fire for repeated privacy breaches, failing to stop fake news and filter bubbles, and for absolving themselves of responsibility when deeply problematic content has spread on their platforms.</p><p>Unlike investment banks, tech companies can't be blamed for a global economic collapse. But the strong case can be made that some of them have seriously weakened democracies.</p><p>The shift from finance tech is real and unmistakeable though. And it is not just cultural. There is arguably a powerful macro trend underpinning it. Ultra-low interest rates have weakened the banks' profitability, but also enabled disruptive businesses that otherwise may not have existed to not just operate, but thrive. This raises an obvious question: what happens if and when interest rates return to more historically normal levels?</p><p>None of this is likely top of mind for Cannon-Brookes, though, who has truly arrived as a member of the global business elite. Not that you would know it from talking to him. \"We have got a shit load of work to do,\" he says. \"We will keep focused on the long term, building the best company we can. For customers ultimately, rather than shareholders, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.\"</p><p>Regulators and politicians are increasingly concerned about the market power of 'Big Tech' companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc76688h21xqoswul7842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ6-H9H1-F0J6-J2M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DF0F</classCode><className>ATLASSIAN PTY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002KMU</classCode><className>ALLEN &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Ruth It is not easy making a physical product\u2014particularly when using biotechnology\u2014and the results may be surprising.&lt;nl/&gt; That was the key message this past weekend from Jonathan Wolfson, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Solazyme (NASDAQ: SZYM[1]) at the NYU Entrepreneurs Festival. At the event, Wolfson, an alumnus of the university, sat with me for a keynote fireside chat about Solazyme's origins and the company's current path.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p>Solazyme produces renewable oil from microalgae for personal-care products, food\u00a0ingredients, and\u00a0industrial uses, along with making\u00a0biofuel that has been tested by the military.&lt;nl/&gt; The company has seen its share of changes and some growing pains, including shifting its focus beyond its early plans for biofuels[2]. Solazyme also took some heat last year because of production delays at its plant in Brazil[3].&lt;nl/&gt; Despite such setbacks, he said the company is pursuing new partnerships and opportunities in industries that were not part of Solazyme's original game plan.&lt;nl/&gt; Xconomy: We're coming up on the anniversary of the founding of the company?&lt;nl/&gt; Jonathan Wolfson: This will formally be the 12th\u00a0anniversary, coming up in a couple of weeks. But the idea goes back to 1989, where I met the guy, who I co-founded the company, on my first day of college.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: How did Solazyme come together; I hear it was founded literally in a garage?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: It's a little more complicated than that. That's the Silicon Valley garage story. While that's completely true, it followed lots of other things. We had been talking about starting a company to make renewable fuels from microalgae going back to the late 1980s. It took us a long time; we both did other things. I started another company [InvestorTree], a financial services firm here in New York.&lt;nl/&gt; After 14 years of talking about it, my friend was living in Palo Alto, I was in New York. I bought a $600 car on Craigslist, drove out to California, and moved in with him and his wife. We set up in the garage with a couple of hundred strings of algae, a futon, and some computers.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: Who did you feel you really had to convince that algae could be used this way and how did you sell them on the idea?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: There was what I thought the idea would be, what it is, and what it became along the way. Those aren't exactly the same thing. I think one of the most important things for either current entrepreneurs or people who are thinking about this is, one of the things that I learned between the first company I started and the second company was that you need to follow the opportunity. Initially the idea was to create low-carbon fuels. We're destroying our planet. There's a real need for low-carbon fuels and it turns out that microalgae were the original oil producers on the planet. They've evolved over billions of years to make oil. When you pull petroleum out of the ground, you can do molecular fingerprinting and demonstrate that a fair amount of that oil originated from microalgae.&lt;nl/&gt; The idea then was, 'How can we speed this up in real time using the tools of modern biotechnology?'&lt;nl/&gt; What ended up happening was the original technology didn't exactly work. We had to retrofit it. This was after we raised our first round of financing. Which led to some very 'exciting' discussions about convincing our early investors that although the original technology, growing algae in big covered ponds, didn't work early on, we arrived at the conclusion that algae was still the best platform to make oil. There was just a different way to do it.&lt;nl/&gt; For us it was industrial fermentation, which means big stainless steel tanks and plant-based sugars. Instead of asking the algae to do photosynthesis themselves, you feed them sugars from other plants that have done it, and then they make oil for you. We had to go back and pitch the initial investors on this idea of growing algae in the dark in big steel tanks. There wasn't that much money in the company, and these were Silicon Valley, risk-taking types. It turned out to work exceedingly well.&lt;nl/&gt; The second thing is if you're making oils, you don't necessarily have to be a company that's dedicated to fuel. Along the way we learned we can turn these oils into anything we use oils for today, from food to industrial applications like soaps, to cosmetics, home care products, and laundry detergents.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: When you started looking to these other segments, did you get concerned you were going in too many different directions?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: That's always been a serious and semi-valid criticism of Solazyme. Once we developed a platform that allowed us to make oils at large scale, and to tailor those oils, that the number of market opportunities we could go into created a lack of focus.&lt;nl/&gt; One of the things that entrepreneurs are forced to do constantly is to trim back lots of really good ideas to keep energy in a relatively narrow band. There's no question that if you try to do everything, you will fail.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: How much of a challenge was it to gather people to work with you on this?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: We had to convince a lawyer to do the legal work for us when we were raising money, and get paid only when money was raised. But that lawyer wouldn't do it unless you convinced them that the idea had currency. We wanted to bring in some advisors so that we could pressure-test the technology and market opportunities. We gave them stock options, but they had to believe those options would be worth something.&lt;nl/&gt; If you expand that out, it applies very heavily to employees and partners.&lt;nl/&gt; We decided very early on we couldn't go vertical in most of our markets. We had to focus on our technology core and being able to make things that could improve people's lives. We brought in a few people in business development in fuels. We were able to form a partnership with Chevron. We also brought in some experts on a consulting basis to help us work with the Pentagon. We ended up forming a huge partnership with the U.S. Navy.&lt;nl/&gt; Solazyme didn't have fuels competency, but we were able to leverage all the people at Chevron and we were able to leverage all the people in the Navy who had tremendous fuels expertise. They told us what we had to make and how. When were looking at personal care, we partnered with Unilever. For paints, we partnered with AkzoNobel.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: Are there misconceptions about biofuel and using microalgae in this way that you had to clear up for others?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: When we first started, I didn't know of another company working in microalgae specifically for fuels. Within a year or two, there were five. Within a couple more years, there were over 100. But they were trying to do the technology the way we originally started to do it. It was hard to explain to people that we were doing it differently.&lt;nl/&gt; We would go to conferences, and people with companies based on technology we had dismissed would give presentations saying you can't grow algae in stainless steel. That it leaches zinc from the stainless steel. We would spend hours with potential financing sources explaining that we were doing it every day.&lt;nl/&gt; We spent years getting to know analysts at consulting firms, having them come in and look at our technology and follow our progress.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: How much of a challenge has it been to scale up what you're doing? It's not like developing an app.&lt;nl/&gt; JW: There's a very substantial difference between building a piece of software or a Web-based service and making physical things. There's an astonishingly big difference. You need to understand that difference when you think about starting a company.&lt;nl/&gt; People look at some of the big tech companies and how they pay large amounts for what seems like somewhat unproven technology, applications, or websites. If you're on the knowledge side of the world, you need constant innovation, but you can get to market relatively quickly and start to generate revenue early. When you're making things, particularly in biotechnology, it takes much longer.&lt;nl/&gt; If you look at the Internet, mobile applications, or even computer hardware, there are investor communities that built up over time in each of these areas, and an investor community that built up around medical biotechnology.&lt;nl/&gt; The space that I'm in doesn't really have that core, investor community yet. It doesn't have that model of how businesses are valued the same way either. That timeline and scale-up, for us, is different.&lt;nl/&gt; We have to assemble very large amounts of capital. To develop this technology, Solazyme has raised over $500 million or $600 million in equity and debt financing from the capital markets. On top of that, we've raised project financing. We built a very large plant in Brazil. We got a low-interest loan from the Brazilian Development Bank. We partnered for a plant in Iowa with ADM (Archer Daniels Midland). Part of this is about taking a concept, proving it out, but if you make stuff you have to be able to make it at scale. That's hard. Sometimes you don't get the timeline that you want.&lt;nl/&gt; At two of our plants, we hit our timelines right on the money. At our biggest plant, in Brazil, it's taken longer to get that plant up. We went public to finance it, and when you go public to finance something, having those kinds of delays out in the open is painful.&lt;nl/&gt; But we're now in the market, for the first time, with many of our food products. We have these low-saturate oils that are healthy from a heart-health perspective. We have a personal care line called Algenist that's in every Sephora and on QVC. Even with all these products, it's been almost 13 years. We just got our key regulatory clearance in the U.S. for our food oil three weeks ago. For our protein and other applications, we got those regulatory clearances last year.&lt;nl/&gt; It's about understanding what you are getting into from the beginning. What do the timelines really look like, as opposed to what you hope they look like? And are you prepared to stay with it?&lt;nl/&gt; XC: Did you ever feel like you bit off more than you could chew? And was there a moment when you felt the company rounded a corner and started to feel more tangible?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: I felt like I bit off more than I could chew for the first five years of running this company. I don't have a technology background. I went to every lab meeting and it was my informal-formal education in biotechnology. There were plenty of times when I thought this was an enormously ambitious project. But that was one of the things that motivated the core people at Solazyme to get out of bed in the morning, taking on something big, hairy, ugly, and has the opportunity to make a huge impact.&lt;nl/&gt; In December 2007, we made our very first in spec fuels. And at the time in California, you couldn't buy a diesel passenger car. So our chairman, who financed us out of the garage, his wife had gone to Nevada and bought a diesel Mercedes. She volunteered to let us borrow her new diesel car and run our fuel in it. I remember fueling up the car, driving it, and thinking this might be doable.&lt;nl/&gt; Then we launched a cosmetic brand in 2011. Never expect that you're going to know what's coming. I never thought I'd be involved in personal care and anti-aging cosmetics.&lt;nl/&gt; The technology we found from the algae while making fuels was really by mistake. The algae made these compounds to protect themselves and it turned out they had really great impact from an anti-aging perspective.&lt;nl/&gt; It's a long road and we're not done.&lt;nl/&gt; XC: What do you see as the driver going forward for Solazyme?&lt;nl/&gt; JW: We are quietly selling fuel every day to a large fleet customer in the U.S. But with oil prices where they are, and being in the early stages of running our big plants, we're not at a place where I think this technology is going to be extremely, broadly adopted for fuel. Notwithstanding the fact that the environmental footprint is dramatically better and we've demonstrated that the Navy could certify an entire fleet of ships and planes running on this stuff.&lt;nl/&gt; Down the line, the fuels will be a very significant component. Right now they are a smaller part of what we do. Food is going to be very important for us, personal care will continue to be, and the Algenist brand continues to grow every year.&lt;nl/&gt; Comments[4] | Reprints[5] | Share: <url

This has been a demanding challenge. At the start of our engagement on financial access back in 2013, we said that having a real target with an end date would keep us focused and give us a benchmark against which we could measure progress.  Last month we learned that we have made strong and consistent progress\u2014a real cause for celebration. </p><p>According to the Global Findex database, more than half a billion people gained a financial transaction account over the last three years, thanks to a combination of technology, private investment, policy reforms, and support from the global community. Since 2011, the share of adults with formal accounts has risen from 51 percent to 69 percent, and financial access has expanded to include an additional 1.2 billion people.   The Global Findex has helped national governments and development organizations understand how people use their accounts, where the gaps are, and how to target interventions. Its insights are central to the World Bank Group\u2019s Universal Financial Access 2020 initiative, a global commitment to ensure that all adults have access to an account by 2020. Since we announced the initiative in 2013, the World Bank Group has added more than 30 partners across the financial sector to help reach this important goal. The Bank Group also remains on target to achieve its commitment to reach 1 billion new accountholders by 2020 through its work.   From access to use  But access isn\u2019t enough. What matters is whether and how people use financial services. The point of financial inclusion, after all, is not just for people to possess an account but to use it to escape poverty, recover from setbacks, and improve their well-being.  The story that emerges from the latest Findex is one of digital technology\u2019s impact on both access and usage. The example of mobile money in Kenya is well known: today, more than 70 percent of Kenyans use their mobile phones to make transactions from their mobile money accounts. In Mongolia, mobile money account ownership rose from less than 5 percent to around 20 percent. The rise of fintech innovations, especially internet-enabled payments, is the second big tech story.  In China, account owners using the internet to pay bills or make purchases jumped from 24 percent to 57 percent. With the internet and e-commerce comes big data, which is making credit more accessible for small firms in a growing number of markets.   To have and have-not  The new Findex data also carries a cautionary message. Our progress so far has been uneven\u2014women, the poor, and people out of the workforce are being left behind.   Despite overall progress, the gaps between haves and have-nots remain as wide as they were when we began to measure in 2011. Sixty-five percent of women now have an account, up from 58 percent in 2014, but the gap between women and men remains a persistent 9 percentage points in developing countries. In Bangladesh, 36 percent of women have an account compared to 65 percent of men, a difference of 29 percentage points. In Pakistan, a man is five times more likely to open an account than a woman.   To close these gaps, we need to understand what women need and want from financial services. We understand that they prioritize privacy, low cost, and security; but we need to do a better job of recognizing how women\u2019s and men\u2019s financial goals differ and identify products and approaches that can help eliminate the gender gap.     This customer-centric perspective brings us again to the challenge of usage. Currently, one in five accounts is dormant, with neither a deposit nor a withdrawal in the past 12 months. Inactive account rates vary across regions but are especially high in South Asia. Understanding the pain points of women, the poor, farmers, and other excluded people will be critical for designing both new services and new regulations.   The ability to digitally depositing payments directly into accounts would be a great springboard for people to open and use accounts. Digitizing government payments, for example, could improve financial inclusion among women by up to 20 percentage points in the Philippines and 28 points in Chile. Doing the same with agricultural payments could reduce the number of unbanked by up to a quarter in Mozambique, Nigeria, and Vietnam. And digitizing wages could bring in about 230 million unbanked people who are paid in cash.   Remittances are another promising arena: roughly 280 million account owners in developing economies still use cash or over-the-counter services to send or receive remittances, including 10 million people in Bangladesh and 65 million in India.  Innovation in the lead  New technologies will improve digitization and reduce the cost of providing financial services. For example, e-money regulations in Senegal, coupled with digitization policies, opened up the market to more e-money issuers and increased financial access. Findex data show that the share of unbanked adults fell to 58 percent in 2017 from 85 percent in 2014, as a result of reforms and increased competition.  Other interventions involve improving infrastructure\u2014for example issuing digital IDs. When people can prove who they are digitally, financial institutions are much more likely to let them open an account.     We are also looking to the future to see the impact of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other fintech innovations that have the potential to reconfigure the entire value chain for financial services.   But we need to strike a balance between unleashing fintech innovations, managing risk and stability, and protecting consumers\u2014especially the poor. Some countries are grappling with this in interesting ways. Malaysia and Kenya are setting up regulatory sandboxes, which allow regulators to observe innovations in a controlled live environment to better understand potential risks and opportunities. Mexico and the Philippines are experimenting with RegTech\u2014applying technology to simplify the cost and time for regulatory compliance and oversight.   Recognizing that financial inclusion can strengthen economies, reduce inequality, and help millions of people lift themselves out of poverty, many countries have established national financial inclusion strategies. These approaches bring together financial regulators, telecommunications and competition authorities, social welfare and education ministries, and the private sector to coordinate and accelerate financial inclusion efforts.   We have made a lot of progress since we started tracking global financial inclusion. Millions of people have gained the chance to improve their lives. We must continue to work together \u2013 governments, development organizations, civil society, and the private sector \u2013 to make sure that number continues to grow.

We've got a packed house here, I think our decision to move to New York was a good one.</p><p>Welcome, and welcome to everybody on the webcast. For those of you I haven't met, my name is John Kraft, I run Investor Relations for ACI. We've got a lot of things to talk about today, and we're very excited to be here to talk about it. First off, we're going to have Phil Heasley, our CEO, discuss the company at a high level, and then we're going to dig a little deeper with Craig Saks, our COO, and Mike Braatz, our Chief Solutions and Marketing Officer.</p><p>From there, we'll talk about the financial opportunity with Scott Behrens, our CFO, and then we'll dive deeper into each of our 6 solutions and 4 target markets that we are catering to. We actually have some customers here as well as some partners. We're very lucky, we will hear from them. We also have a couple of demos, so we will do those as well, and then finally, at the end, we'll have plenty of time for Q&amp;A so please save your Q&amp;A towards -- to the end. And then for those of you in New York, we'll have lunch in the back room there and then we'll have our solution breakouts after that.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Phil.</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I want to thank you coming at 08:30 in Manhattan, being past New Yorker, it's a lot to ask people to start at 08:30 in the morning, so thank you for being here. I have 3 objectives this morning, I'm not going to spend a lot of time -- I'm not going to be up here for a long time. One is, I want to, as John did, I want to thank everyone for coming and then I want to say hello. My second objective is that I am actually going to be saying goodbye, so this is the last time that you guys get to pick on me until I'm going to be leaving ACI. I announced my retirement a couple of weeks ago, and before I do, I want to take you through same conversation that we've had almost every single Analyst Day, so if you've been here over the years, I'm going to take you through the same structure that we've gone through for the last, say, 12 years, and it's about the transformational journey of control, profitability and growth.</p><p>We've kind of done it backwards in terms of how we do it, but the concept that initiated this whole activity that's now ACI is that we believed in digital commerce, and we believed in real time 15 years ago, and you'll say, well, what's the big deal, except most of the world thought the Internet, at that point, was a novelty and a good way of distributing porn, right? And there wasn't really -- it's not viewed the way it's -- the way it's viewed today, and if any of you have read the recent book called the Revenge of the Goliath (sic) [Goliath's Revenge] it's a great book because it says that most of the winners in the new digital age could very well be the people who were successful in the last turn, but they have to reinvent themselves and they've got the assets, but they have to make those assets relevant in a digital world.</p><p>And we believed in that a long time ago, and we have gone through the process of investing very, very heavily, starting off with the machine-dependent set of software, and we are now sitting here today with machine-independent software, as a matter of fact, the concept of hardware playing a major role in the digital world is no longer exists, it's having the ability to create a payment, in our case it's about payment and then being able to -- for it to have a beginning and an end, so you have to have -- you have to be able to take any kind of payment and deliver it to any kind of location. We've worked on that for a long time, and we also understood that the hub-and-spoke, peer-to-peer structure of payments in a SaaS then cloud world was going to land up changing and it wasn't going to be about the hub-and-spoke anymore, it was going to be about this whole network, fiber effect of payments. Therefore, you're going to basically have to do any payment, every possibility, which has become our -- which become our tagline and whatnot. In order to do that, we've spent a lot of money on R&amp;D over the last 15 years. We've made over 20 acquisitions, and we haven't been an aggregator, we've been an integrator, which is extremely painful because when you aggregate things, you're still being a tribute to the past. When you integrate them, you take them apart and you put them back together in a way that's going to work going forward.</p><p>We've really changed the economics of payments and we haven't necessarily changed that in a way that makes all shareholders thrilled with us at the moment, but they should be. A term you're going to hear more and more and more in the next 1, 3, 5 years is about take rate. And take rate is how much does what you do in a payment, what you get paid to do that. And historic payments, they earn something around 30 basis points of take rate, so you say with the financial thing, so what do they earn? They earn about 30. If you look at all the new immediate payment schemes and whatnot going on around the world, there is probably room for 10 to 12 basis points of take rate, so there has to be productivity. Productivity is going to have to bring itself to this payments arena, and I think we're going to be faced with 2 phenomena. I think we're going to have about [1/10] the players in some not-so-distant future, and we're going to have about 10x the volumes that we have right now. So it may be 7 and it may be whatever, but directionally, that's the way it's going to go. And if you look at what's taking place in these horizontal mergers and you look at what's taking place in terms of changing behavior of Visa, Mastercard, and then may be even more importantly, you look at the change that's taking place in the banks, the banks are playing much more utility role and they're being relegated to dealing effectively with their good funds. And of course, that's their primary role. Visa, Mastercard and certainly Mastercard has -- I'm not stating anything, they wouldn't state at their own Analyst Day, is they're seeing credit card and debit card as being 2 of probably 15 or 20 different ways people are going to be able to pay over time, and they want to morph themselves into a very primary -- instead of being a branding element of that point of sale, they want to be a major player at that point of sale. The banks have all begun to move their merchant acquiring from being subordinate activities to their cards to they becoming primary activities of treasury management, so what does that mean? That means that the banks now realize that who they're really representing at the point of sale is the merchant or the corporation who is participating in that sale.</p><p>This, by the way, is nothing different than we said what's going to happen 12 years ago when we were talking to you guys, you all thought we were nuts at that point. That's really going to not only change the economics, but your value chain is not going to look like, right now, you do a payment, and you don't know how many times it touches other kinds of things, and I would say that in very short order, in years, but short order, the participants at the sale are going to be good funds, the branded driver of the payment and personally selling the goods. So that's what's going to confront the customer. It's really going to change what's taking place. Now you're going to see some presentations later on today and I would really spend a lot of your attention, if you really want to concentrate on one, concentrate on what's going on in India, because it is probably the blueprint for what's taking place in the payments, and people say, well, it's kind of one-off. It's not very much one-off. Why do Facebook and Google do so well at what they do? Because they present something to the mass market, which is free to the mass market, and they derive their value in terms of the participants who want to enjoin themselves in terms of that. India is really -- has really reinvented their payment system in a way that almost works the way Google would work or as matter of fact, they use Google and Facebook and whatnot in terms of making it happen. So that's one I would really take a look at because it's really, really going to change. And this key change that we are in is it's happening. I always told some of you guys, I didn't want to let go of this activity till we actually -- the Exodus was actually complete that we actually saw the new -- of the new activity taking place. And I think we see it. In the U.S., it's a little bit hidden because whereas U.S. banks have been told, you got to do immediate payments and they built you immediate payment infrastructure into the Clearinghouse and then no one has built a use case to actually use it in an effective kind of way. It's kind of frustrated the government and I guess they're claiming to build their own kinds of -- but you're not -- it's -- you really don't, if the Clearinghouse doesn't do it, it's going to happen by itself anyhow and if I were Visa, Mastercard, I would say, well, how do I do it, and then there's some other players that got very strong switching kinds of activities. Are we going to move? Thank you. Right. I always like to put these 2 up every time we do one of these because these haven't changed, our vision and our mission have not changed and a lot of what you're going to see today are going to go through cases and progress as it relates to it, but the concept that you're going to be able -- a payment is going to be the choice of not only what you use to pay is going to be your choice, how that payment transforms itself is going to land up being something that is totally visible to you, and I don't think we're going to go through the data privacy elements that -- of the Indian, but when India was reinventing their payment system, the first thing they did was, they thought through data privacy. And they said these are the rules you got to do from a data privacy standpoint and as long as you follow these rules, then you're not going to get in trouble in terms of how we reinvent payments, which is little bit different than Europe, where in Europe, they said, okay, we don't need to involve the people who have data, we're just going to tell them what the rules are and whatnot, and we're going to give the people the ability to choose or not choose. Well, it's kind of interesting and the Indian one that kind of gave everyone a standard, so to speak whatnot, but in the case of Europe, I don't know if you know, I think they're up to 93%, have opted in, so the whole concept of restricting that data is not working the way that people thought it was going to -- is not going to work the way people thought it was going to take place.</p><p>So Craig Saks is going to come up here, and he is going to start taking you into the meat and potatoes and before I get us into the introduction of him, I do want to tell you guys that my departure is not a departure that leaves us with any weakness in resource. We have a very, very strong management team here, with the exception of Eve, who is going to present to you later, was only been with us for 3 years. The average tenure of the executive team is 10, probably 10, 11 years with people here, 15 and people here as little as 8, 9. And it's a very talented team. When I went through control, profitability, growth, we are really at the place in transformation that -- I think you know our software has been taken off the mainframe, it's been put on the cloud and it runs, not -- without changing a line of code. We're at the point now that we have to address the opportunity that will be created by scale, because our software can do a lot more than our resources. We've got to get people to want to come to our door, you are going to hear about a partnership with Azure today, which is going to be a good example of it, and we have the team that can propel the growth that we need.</p><p>I'm a transformation guy, and I have no qualms about it. I like to go take things from one thing and bring them to the other. My forte is not going around and doing 54 partnerships with 23 different kinds of go-to market kind of capabilities, but this team's ability to go and execute on what we have is very real and they are very, very talented.</p><p>And with that, I'm going to introduce Craig Saks, who is our Chief Operating Officer and he'll start taking you through the meat and potatoes. Thanks, Craig.</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS, SENIOR EVP &amp; COO, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thanks very much, Phil. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much, Phil. We are all very excited about the next phase of the journey and achieving that growth that Phil has spoken about off the wonderful platform that we've built that is ACI today that is highly relevant in the changing world of payments, and we'll spend some time on that. Also like to reiterate our welcome to everyone here in New York and on the webcast, for those of you that have been with us and old friends for a very long time, thank you for your ongoing support, for the many new people that have joined us, thank you for your interest in what we do.</p><p>We trust that you'll have a very good morning, and that you'll find real value in the conversation. Windfall had the sea change slide up. If don't know if you noticed that, that's really nice little icon of a boat, the sailboat, and I think that's a great analogy for a lot of the conversation this morning. Countries that had a strong maritime capability in the past were actually significantly advantaged in terms of their ability to explore the world, discover new lands and build great wealths for their nations. And in many respects, it's exciting to think about the ACI that we've built as being a stronger ship that I think can sail forth into growth, into innovation and driving real value for everyone involved in ACI, so that's great.</p><p>Given the fact that, that a number of people and you, we thought we would start just with an overview of ACI. And all for those of you that have been with us for 15 years. You find 1 or 2 things that are fresh insights, but we'll discuss a little bit of what we do. First of all, these are the numbers in terms of who and what we are and how we show up around the world. And there are some really interesting stats there. But you need to frame those in the context of our core opportunity and our main opportunity. Our core strategy, rather, then our main opportunity, which is really this notion that Phil spoke about of real-time any to any payment. ACI has been very successful at putting ourselves in the center of what is a major transformational move in the world of payments over the next decade or 2, which is real-time payments and the ability to pay anyone across the global ecosystem. And you'll hear a lot more about that and how we do see ourselves as being in a very good position and well advantaged in that. Broadly speaking, there are probably 3 things you should take away from these numbers. I'm going to talk through them individually. First of all, we've been around for 45 years, which means that we've got a great depth of institutional knowledge and payments experience. You're going to struggle to find another team of people that know as much about payments and have learned all the lessons the hard way over 45 years and have continued to remain relevant and reinvent ourselves and develop mature and responsible product management and product development processes. So great institutional knowledge, great depth in our team on the global stage. The second important point is if you look at those numbers is that we have an amazing customer base all over the world, covering the entire payments value chain. Some of the world's most demanding and biggest brands use us to power their businesses and to power their growth, and it's exciting to have that footprint around the world. And then the third point I'd make is that we actually are a nicely scaled software business. We're at the point where we can continue to invest very meaningful numbers in R&amp;D on an ongoing basis, which ensures our ongoing relevance and participation in the marketplace. So nicely positioned business, good customer base, great team, and we look forward to building on that. At the simplest level, what we've drawn here, and for those of you that are really deep into payments. It's a simple representation. I'm sure some of you would want to add a bits and pieces, but let's keep it up at this level, is you've got a payment value chain. And on the one side, on the one end, you've got the merchants and billers. Those are the places where consumers obviously pay their bills or buy from the merchants and buy goods and services. On the other side, you've got the banks, where people's accounts exist. And those banks, obviously, give you access to the money in those accounts via online and mobile banking via various payment abilities. And in the middle, you have the intermediaries, people who may facilitate payments between the merchants and the billers and the banks and vice versa. And those intermediaries take a whole range of different forms. It can be the payment networks, it can be acquirers. It can be some of the new closed-loop networks. It can be PSPs. It's really people that facilitate payments between the participants. And of course, these participants also pay each other. And we play in all those spaces. So given that sort of high-level context, we'd like to describe our business in a very simple 6 solutions, 4 market segments, 2 operating models or deployment models and the 1 ACI. And so let's look at how that falls in. We've got the 6 solution areas. They are very strong in that they cover the entire payments value chain. We have capabilities that support people's businesses throughout the payment value chain. And that's one of the differentiators of ACI. We know how to work payments throughout the ecosystem. We're not limited to one space as the world transforms, as alliances come and go and change, we are well positioned. Phil mentioned the realignment between some of the acquiring businesses and the treasury side of banks. Well, the good news is we play on all sides. And so that really serves us well. The 6 top-level solutions, you'll see there very briefly. We've got merchant payments, which enable all payments at a retailer, be it physically in-store or online. And so the whole omni-channel story is a strong part of our story. We've got bill payments, which we've spoken about a lot this year, enables a consumer to pay in a multitude of different ways when they need to settle their bill with the service providers.</p><p>Obviously, and you'll hear a lot more about that. That particular solution has really got a lot new -- a lot of additional scale, given the Speedpay acquisition. We have our retail payment solution. That takes care of consumer payments of all types. Historically, you might have known that as being a card-centric offering. But for the last few years, it's moved way beyond that. It not only does card payments, but it also does real-time payments and alternative payment types. Essentially can take care of the entire range of payment needs that a bank or intermediary might have when they're trying to support the consumer credit space. And that's a really important shift because the world of payments are moving to real time, and this is a unique value proposition. It's a unique offering. I haven't seen anything else around the world, where off a single solution, you're able to run both your card payment franchise as well as the new world of real-time payments. We also sell real-time payments as a stand-alone solution, not just the new low-value immediate payments, but also what would have traditionally been higher-value payments or wires. There are not a lot of people there that can claim, in fact, I don't know if anyone else, that can claim that have a single solution that does both low value and higher value, again, on a single universal payments capability. So a very strong story around real time in both those solutions.</p><p>Our digital channels offering that really is mobile and online banking and treasury management for corporates, focus, particularly in the U.S. market space and then underpinning all our solutions across the entire value chain, we have what we call Payments Intelligence. It's our set of solutions that predominantly are focused on payments, fraud management, protecting customers and consumers when people are doing payments, and we protect the entire value chain. We are not only strong on the merchant side, on the card not present, but we're also strong in the intermediary and bank side. And that, I think, is also quite a unique positioning from a fraud perspective. And then, of course, as we move on to the 4 segments or the 4 markets of types of customers we focus on, they largely align with the value chain, where we cover merchants, billers, intermediaries and banks. We have a strong franchise in each of those areas, which is a great story, and you'll hear a lot more from the various speakers this morning as they cover the value we create and add to the businesses of our customers in those 4 different segments.</p><p>And then we talk about our 2 business models or deployment models. eShop has our 2 P&amp;Ls, the ACI On Premise P&amp;L and the ACI On Demand P&amp;L, that's how we report our numbers. But essentially, we've got our IP that we are able to deliver to the market in 2 different ways. Through a software license model, where our customers would run the software in their own data centers or in the public cloud, and you'll hear a lot more about the public cloud. I think it's an important and an exciting trend in the marketplace and one that we play well to. So that will take care of the part of the market, that wants to still have their own software instance that they're able to customize and optimize to their business and run under their own control. But there's also a very large part of the market that prefers a consumption-based model, where they access the technology on a platform basis. And our ACI On Demand business, our cloud business would provide a number of our solutions in ACI On Demand for those customers that wish to consume our solutions through a consumptional platform offering. And then finally, we get to the one, and the one really refers to the global ACI team. We are very privileged to have a great team of people that have worked -- that work around the world. We have staff in offices just about in every major country, not only supporting the ACI customers, but learning from the marketplace. I think it's a real advantage that we have people that know and understand what's happening in Asia or happening in Latin America or happening in Europe or happening in America and able to bring those perspectives and insights to the global ACI story. And I think that's a great advantage that we have. It's also a wonderful team, a team of people that work in many different languages, many different cultures, but truly are a team that are committed to the global ACI franchise. And then, of course, at the end of the day, as a software company. It's all about intellectual property of payments and pay-grade payment solutions, and we have a very real commitment to managing a single intellectual property base, a single set of solutions with the future in mind and that we can then deploy through the different business models to all those different customer segments around the world.</p><p>So in a nutshell, that's ACI 6-4-2-1, a very simple overview of what we do for those of you that may be a little bit more new to us. Of course, it's also important to understand how these different dimensions show up in the ACI business from a financial perspective. And Scott Behrens, our CFO, will be delving into some of the specifics. But suffice it to say at this point that has a simple view of it, you've got the license business, software license business, the ACR On Premise P&amp;L, you've got the ACI On Demand platform or consumption business, being our second P&amp;L, and they both have got to the point where over the last few years, we've built a far more balanced and healthy combination. Both businesses have a strong, large, profitable solution that underpins the businesses there. So on the software license side, our retail payments solution, it has got great margins. It is a nice large part of that business. On demand side, a lot of the scale is bought by the combined ACI and Speedpay Bill Pay assets, again, creating a nice scale business as significant revenue and ever-improving and strengthening profits and margins that are good. But the important thing is that, while we've got these scale businesses with good margins. We also have a number of solutions that are driving high growth. And there's some strong solutions, and Scott will share some of those numbers, that over the last few years, they've performed incredibly well, particularly in the area of real time, which is good. If the future of payments is real time, you should be pleased that ACI is doing very well in the world of real time. Merchant payments, particularly e-commerce, are really growing very, very well for us and continue to embrace that trend in the marketplace. And then, of course, Payments Intelligence continues to be a good grower for us as we're able to sell the ability to protect the transactions that our payment engines facilitate and process.</p><p>So in a nutshell, a far more balanced business, more balance between the 2 different deployment models, each of which have a strong underpinning foundation of good economics as well as nice, strong growth areas. So very excited about where we've gotten all the work that's been done over the last decade to get here. Of course, if ACI is a boat on a voyage, it's important that you have good sails to propel that boat forward, the engines of the boat. And we've spent a lot of time and energy over the last 12 and 24 months, working on making sure that nothing internally gets in the way of letting ACI go after the market opportunity and pursue that opportunity strongly and drive forward into the future. And so there are 3 areas that I'd like to highlight. We've done a lot of work transforming how we go to market. Both in the sales area as well as in the customer success area, managing our customer relationships, managing cross-sell and so on. And we've made some very good progress there, quite excited to see the performance in Q3, we expect good momentum into Q4 and into next year on the booking side. So that's been positive. Spent a lot of time aligning our staff internally so that we maximize the collaboration between our teams and our customer side. We've done a lot of work reengineering our sales and customer success processes and some of the results are starting to show, and we feel good about that. We've also spent a lot of time and energy turning our attention externally with a much greater emphasis on customer centricity. And I'm pleased to say that over the last 2 years, our customer satisfaction scores in both years have shown significant improvement. So we're starting to get traction. And that's really important. Particularly on the consumption side of the business, retention is something that you've got to care about, cross-sell across the whole business is something that you care about, ever-improving customer experience scores are good leading indicators of ongoing success and progress in that realm.</p><p>The second area that we've been focusing on is speed and agility. We're very pleased and proud of how far we've come. A few years ago, a lot of you would remember, we spoke about speeding up our services. But we're now at the point where we can build a complete national infrastructure for real-time payments in less than 12 months. And that's quite spectacular, and we've proven that. We built the national real-time rails, the new central infrastructure for real-time payments in Malaysia with PayNet in 12 months from contract signature to the first go-live with real-time transactions between 2 banks. And also importantly, we've made real progress in other solutions. So for example, this year, we implemented a complete new acquiring solution for a global top 20 bank in the public cloud from contract signatures to the first friends and family transactions in less than 7 months. And that's a really good news story. Anyone that thinks we're slow and stodgy should actually look at these stats, I think they are spectacular in terms of what we've achieved. We're able to move fast. And that's good for our customers. It's good for our growth. It's good for time to revenue. It's a very, very compelling and strong story. And so I'm very proud of the work that our teams have done, both in the product areas as well as in our services areas to speed up the marketplace, to speed up ACI and to really demonstrate real agility. So a good positive story there.</p><p>And then, of course, lastly, we continue to build out our operating platforms in AOD. We need to make sure that we complete the integration and the consolidation of the platforms, for example, in Bill Pay, that's going to drive expanding margins over the next 1, 2 and 3 years, and it will be a great engine of accelerating and continuing the margin improvement in those parts of the business. But also very importantly, as we build out those platforms, it's going to create new services, new capabilities and new opportunities for the marketplace. You've heard us talk about the Universal Payments Platform, and more and more of what ACI does will show up as part of our platform, and we think that, that will show well in the market over the next few years.</p><p>All right. And then I'd like to spend a few minutes in close just talking about some of the industry trends. So we've got a boat, we've got sails but we need wind in those sails. And these trends in the marketplace are really driving and propelling ACI into the future. And the great news is we are very well aligned to benefit from these particular market trends. And some of them build on some of Phil's comments. So the first key trend is that there's a major shift from being card-centric to real time. Real time is where payments are going. I can very easily and boldly say that in 20 years' time, I think just about every payment in the world is going to be real time. It certainly is a huge market opportunity. It's a massive transformation of what's going to be going on in the world of payments over the next few decades, and we're nicely positioned in the middle of that. Part of that is obviously that some card volumes are gradually going to shift across to real-time account-to-account payments. And we are nicely positioned, as I mentioned earlier on, our solutions do card and real time off a single solution. And so we really are quite unique in the ability to help our customers through that transition without being placed at risk that they'd look elsewhere for that capability. The second thing around our real-time story is that we've got amazing brand acceptance in brand surveys we've done. We're the global leader from a brand recognition perspective for what we do in real time. And we have the proof points. We have live customers in over 16 different countries. So a very strong story. If you believe in the real-time payments trend, you have to believe in the future of ACI and our ongoing relevance in the payments marketplace.</p><p>The second trend is around payments acceptance. Over the last 12 months, it's actually quite interesting, I've had conversations with 5 different payment networks, 3 in the U.S., 2 in Asia. And one of the things that we've spoken about quite a lot has been cross-network acceptance. And I think it's -- and the ability to not just be caught in a single-branded set of rails. In the past, it was like, if I had a Visa or Mastercard, I could pretty much pay anywhere. They've done a great job in terms of building acceptance around the world. But the reality is that there is this proliferation of ways to pay, there's a shift to real-time payments, and the various payment participants are wrestling with how do they accept payments across different types, how do they accommodate all of these different payment experiences that the consumers are using around the world. It's a function of payments innovation. It's a function of the globalization of payments. It's a function of the fact that businesses are global, and people are traveling. I went to Sydney earlier this year, and you walk in Downtown Sydney, and you'll be amazed by how many of the stores, in fact, every store I walked past has acceptance of AliPay and WePay, to support their Chinese customers. And so the world of saying that a single-branded experience is enough has passed. Banks, merchants and acquirers need to be able to accept a multitude of different payment types, because their customers are wanting to use a multitude of different payment types. And it's important that your technologies are able to support that.</p><p>ACI, again, just because of what we've done over the years is well positioned for this conversation and quite advantaged. First of all, our technology switch all these different transactions. We are connected to all the different networks and all the different payment types and we actually switch those transactions. And secondly, we are very often the way that banks connect their payment world to the accounts that their customers hold with them. And so we have not only the ability to switch any payment type, but we are also connected to the source of funds that those payments are executing against. And that really, from an infrastructure perspective, is the reason that all these different entities are talking to us about how can they connect and cross-operate given the switching and inflection and connectivity that ACR provides to the various accounts. Then you'll hear a little bit more about that in a moment. The third big shift is the shift from outright ownership to consumption-based preferences in society. Recently I heard people describe America is becoming a nation of renters, leases and subscribers. And I think it's true. My children will pay a monthly subscription fee for a music service. They will never buy a CD, and you see the preference and the shift to subscription payments in everything from digital content through to children's shoes to cars, to razors to you name it. People are starting to buy on that basis. And that trend is actually an interesting one. We are continuing to embrace that in our solutions and supporting subscription payments in our biller and merchant solutions. We're partnering with subscription players around the world because it's a big growth area for us, but also beyond the consumer world, you're seeing subscription [cut-eye] preferences show up in our technology world, the most obvious place you see it is the preference of a lot of companies to move away from owning their own IT infrastructures to actually using it on a consumption basis in the public cloud. And of course, lots of applications are being bought as platform services today. That's where a lot of the growth has been. And that's why ACI On Demand business is so important to ACI and ACI's future, and we are well poised from a technology perspective, from our support of the public cloud, from the capabilities in our solutions to do this.</p><p>The second last trend is around this question of stand-alone payments to frictionless experiences. Historically, my perception is the act of shopping or the act of commerce was separate from the act of paying, I'd shop, then I'd go pay. Well, Amazon 1-Click and services like Uber with their embedded payments have changed that dynamic totally. Gone are the days where payments were separate as industries have gone through their digital transformation, the world of payments needs to go through a digital transformation. And the act of payment needs to be more and more embedded into the act of commerce and the service that is being provided. And we right at the center of that, it requires technologies that are open, that are flexible that enable you to orchestrate payment flows together with the consumer experiences, those are all characteristics of the ACI Universal Payments technology. And then the final trend is obviously around data. We have access to a ton of data. There's been a lot of noise in the marketplace around data being exploited to the disadvantage of the owner of that data or the source of that data. And the world, consumers want to reclaim their personal digital identity. The regulators are enforcing it. And so there's this whole conversation about shifting from the exploitation of data, which has been what's been going on the last decade to responsible data use.</p><p>And we've always been in the place where we've not used the masses of payment data that we see for gain outside of the core purpose, which the marketplace has asked us to work with their data, which is the protection of consumers when they pay. And we continue to invest in payments intelligence and in the responsible management of the data that we have access to and has been a nicely growing part of our business, as you'll see in a moment. So those are our trends, they're going to be very present over the next 5 years, our capabilities, our solutions and what have you are well, well, well poised to participate in that and hopefully see a spurt of growth.</p><p>All right. And I think that's pretty much the end of it. Thank you very much. I'm excited about the voyage ACI is on. I'm excited about the capabilities we've built our sales, and I'm very excited about the opportunities that are going to propel us forward into the future. And with that, I'd like to hand over to Mike Braatz, our Chief Product and Marketing Officer. Thank you very much.</p><p>MIKE BRAATZ, CHIEF MARKETING &amp; SOLUTIONS OFFICER, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: All right. Thanks, Craig. Hi, everybody. I'll add my welcome. Really appreciate such a great audience here today. So what I want to do is I want to take that last section that Craig talked about, the industry trends, the wind in our sails. And I want to connect that to the ACI strategy, and more specifically, our product strategy. So you can understand how the investments we're making, the bets we're making in our portfolio are really setting us up well to take advantage of those market trends. So what I want to start with is, let's call it, the size of the prize, the market opportunity. And this is for those of you who've been at these events in the past. This is something we show every year, we do an annual market sizing to understand our addressable opportunity. And the number is big. But before I get to the number, I want to explain something. Phil mentioned this a little bit in his remarks, but just to clarify, 1 payment does not necessarily equal 1 transaction. One payment actually can generate multiple transactions. If you think about just the simple act of buying something in the store, the merchant sees the payment. That's their transaction, they may hand that off to an acquirer. There's a transaction there. There may be a processor involved, another transaction. And then finally, it hits your bank account, that's yet another transaction. So when you look at the number 5.8 trillion, understand that those are all of the transaction types that can be make up that number. And that number is our 5-year opportunity. We think about strategy in kind of 5 year increments. You'll probably also notice if you're here last year that, that number is up from last year significantly. Now it is a year later, but it's up significantly. And the reason is it goes back to this discussion of real-time payments and the real-time opportunity. Many payments that really weren't addressable just as recently as last year, we've now said they are addressable because of the growing real-time opportunity, and that's how you get a big number like 5.8 trillion. And to understand the graphic, half of those transactions are available with products in our portfolio today. So with very little incremental investment. We feel like that is our addressable opportunity. The other half would require product investment and, in some cases, inorganic activity partnerships and M&amp;A activity to get there. But that's our opportunity. So let's break that down a little bit and kind of bring it back to today, and if you back that 5-year opportunity to today, the number is 1.8 trillion transactions. So that is current year number, and you can see how it breaks out by market segments that we serve. And you can see that across those segments, we estimate that ACI's share of the global transaction opportunity is in the mid-teens, and we expect that to grow to the high teens over the 5-year period. And then you can see that, that's just almost a 12% annual growth rate in terms of transactions.</p><p>So the opportunity is sizable. If you take what we're doing today, which is roughly 250 billion, 260 billion transactions, and you go to 450 billion. So we're going to add over 200 billion transactions processed by ACI software over the next 5 years. So that's the size of the prize. How do we get there? Our product strategy is really a mirror of ACI's mission statement. And that makes sense, right? We are a software products company, it makes sense that our product strategy just fits really nicely into our overall mission. And you see it right here on the page, right? We enable real-time any-to-any payments. And I want to break down each of those -- each of the parts of that statement, so you can understand enable. So we're very clear about who we are. We are a software company. We are not an operator of branded payment systems, but we do provide technology to those who do operate payment systems. And that's those 4 market segments, merchants, billers, intermediaries and banks that Craig took you through, and we provide that technology through 2 business models, a licensed business model and then a platform business model. So that's how we enable payments to happen. Real time, in a digitally transformed world, real-time payments is the gold standard. I think Craig covered that quite well. But I think of real time as having kind of 2 connotations. I think one is the technical connotation, a real-time payment means real-time authorization, clearing, settlement, technically, a real-time payment. Immediate payment, faster payment, whatever. So there's that aspect of it. And that's really important, of course, that opportunity is big and getting bigger. The second aspect of real-time payment is really more experiential, right? So Craig talked about transactions becoming part of the experience. And in a real-time world, the consumer has to feel that the experience is real-time as well, meaning their preferred payment method is embedded in the experience as frictionless way as possible so that they can kind of move on with their lives. And that could be regardless of the payment type. So it could be truly a real time payment, but it could also be a card payment, it could be an alternative payment. It could be a wire payment, whatever the payment type, that experience to the consumer, and in a lot of cases, to the receiver, needs to be and feel real time.</p><p>Finally, any to any. Our software is payments-agnostic, we can accept any payment type, and we support all the participants in the value chain, as Craig showed, and it's also -- and it speaks to being omni-channel. So wherever you want to pay, whether that's in a store, at an ATM, online, on your mobile device, at a kiosk, all the various methods that consumers and businesses choose to pay now, we support that in our software. So it's truly omni-channel in the largest sense. And I'll talk a little bit more in a minute about endpoints and how endpoints make any to any a reality for us and our largest collection of endpoints on the planet. It is something that's going to really drive the growth of our business.</p><p>And the other thing I'll say about any to any, this could be card present. It could be card not present. And frankly, it could be no card at all. It's truly any to any. And this strategy is how we measure ourselves, I think, combine that with the transaction opportunity. Really, that is what is going to drive our growth going forward. Okay. Now I want to talk about investments that we make across our product portfolio. So these are really important elements of our product roadmap that we're investing in, regardless of who our software is being delivered to, regardless of the use case, these are capabilities that support really foundational capabilities across our portfolio. So the first is endpoints. And think of endpoints as nodes in any payment flow. It could be where a payment starts, where it ends and where it might have to be stopped and processed or evaluated along the way. So these can be connections to devices, point of sale, ATMs, your mobile device, it could also be connectivity to your bank account or your biller or your card network or your real-time network or some alternative payment networks. So all of these nodes that make payment flows possible. And the more endpoints that we have gives us the ability to support more payment flows and more payment types. And we have a collection today of thousands of endpoints to support our global customers. And we're adding hundreds of new endpoints every year. And one of the things that Eve will talk about later, is our -- think of it as endpoint as a service. So this is our strategy, where we use an endpoint factory to build all of our endpoints, and this allowed -- this endpoint factory allows us to build endpoints better, faster, cheaper, but really importantly, an endpoint we build for 1 product or 1 customer now immediately becomes available for all of our other products and all of our other customers who want to take advantage of that endpoint. And that's real leverage, and that's going to be one of the big growth drivers for us going forward as we continue to build on this endpoint leadership. The second foundational product strategy we have is optimizing for the cloud. So Craig talked about this a little bit, you're going to hear more from -- about our partnership with Microsoft on this. But just a few years ago, cloud-native deployment was, I'll call it an interesting proof-of-concept that we were certainly investing in, in our labs, but fast-forward to today, just a few years in the future, and here we are, we have large customers deploying their software live in production in the public cloud. And it's really a foundational part of our product and technology strategy today, this idea of cloud-native deployment. And our secret sauce when it comes to deploying in the cloud is our ability to combine high-performance payment grade software with a low-cost infrastructure in the public cloud and then delivered in the consumption business model. That combination is something that very, very few companies in the market can do, and we're proving it, and we have proof points with customers today. And we believe that's going to be one of our big differentiators going forward. The next is open APIs. So I like to think of open APIs is kind of the easy button when it comes to integrating payments into all of the experiences that consumers and businesses expect when they want to pay. So whether it's -- whether it's mobile apps, whether it's digital wallets, whether it's e-commerce, whether it's request to pay, whether it's payment service providers wanting to build new applications for their merchant customers. All of these interesting use cases for commerce need payments in them. And we're building those experiences for our customers through our applications, our customers want to build their own applications. And then you have third-party fintechs and other companies in the market trying to build these experiences and the easiest way for them to get payments in is through APIs. And through a single API with ACI, you can get access to all of those endpoints, all of those payment service capabilities, all of that fraud protection that we've talked about here, and that's a big part of our strategy. So you can consume our solutions as a full stack application or you can consume the parts that you need through this API strategy.</p><p>Next is high performance. So Phil and Craig did a good job covering kind of the sea change and some of the changes going on in the market. One of the outcomes of these changes in the market is that scale is more important than ever in payments. Our customers have always been some of the largest operators of payment systems, the largest merchants, the largest banks in the world. And some of them just got a lot bigger. And I think more than ever, they need technology partners who've proven their ability to operate at that kind of scale, whose technology can operate at that kind of scale, supporting massive volumes of payments. It used to be -- we talked about billions of transactions a month was an impressive scale. Now we are seeing billions of transactions a day in certain systems. And you need software that can handle that kind of scale. And it's not just scalability, but it's also availability. It's high throughput, it's payments-grade security, all of those things, which have really been a hallmark for ACI over the last 40-plus years, it continues to be a major focus, and we believe it's going to be even more important focus as some of the largest payment operators in the world look for partners that can scale with them.</p><p>The last thing is Payments Intelligence. And so customers, consumers are taking back control of their data. I know we don't always see it in our day to day yet, but this is something that is happening. And our Payments Intelligence capabilities is what is allowing those customers to reclaim their digital identity. And we have had a major project and a major investment going on over the last few years to upgrade our data and analytics capabilities. And one of the most important outputs of that is our ability to do behavioral profiling. So our customers can understand what is normal? And also what is abnormal behavior for their customers using all of our data, and that does 2 things: one, it allows them to provide excellent experiences, frictionless experiences for their good customers, and it also allows them to pinpoint abnormal risky behavior that's likely to be fraud, so they can stop those transactions in real time. And that drives value for everybody. It drives value for the payer, for the payee, it drives value for our customer and, of course, for ACI. It's all about reducing friction and increasing value as part of that experience. So with those foundations set, I want to turn to talk about our strategy for our products across the 4 market segments that we serve. And I'm going to start with biller. And some of these themes are going to be what you've heard earlier from Craig, I want to dive a little deeper, and then we'll talk -- Dan is going to talk more about our biller strategy later, but I want to make sure that I connect those market trends that Craig covered on his last page to our strategy, so you can understand how that wind in the sails is really helping us.</p><p>First of all, it's been said, but it's worth repeating. The biller is really the foundation of our AOD business today. And with the acquisition of Speedpay, combining those platforms, combining really the best of Speedpay and their front-end platform, with the best of ACI and our back-end platform, that's really -- that's given us the scale, and that's really going to be the foundation of driving the business going forward. So one of the trends Craig mentioned was the shift from stand-alone payments to frictionless experiences. And this is a big part of our thesis with the Speedpay acquisition. They have invested heavily in the front end, the user experience as part of their bill pay application. If you think about it, paying a bill today in a lot of segments is a lot -- looks a lot more like an e-commerce transaction than it does to kind of the old way we used to pay bills. And that means a modern, engaging consumer experience. It means receiving your bill electronically and being able to view it and get information about it and actually pay with 1-Click, it means things like getting your bill in your digital wallet on your phone. And our Walletron capability that came with the Speedpay acquisition is one of those capabilities. We're really excited about that it's going to drive growth. And then the other thing about our biller strategy is it's very vertical-specific. So the biller solution and the experience for, let's say, a utility customer might look very different from the experience if you're a higher education customer or somebody who's trying to pay their auto or mortgage loan. Same platform, different experience. And so we've built these specific user experiences. And one of the ones I like to talk about is our student portal for higher education. So now students at universities using the ACI Bill Pay solution, students have one place to go where they can view all the information about the \"commerce\" they do with the university, whether it is paying tuition, which is really important, but also, think of all the other payment opportunities that students have when they're at school for buying things and kind of doing business.</p><p>The second trend in the biller -- the second trend that Phil -- that Craig talked about that I want to talk about, is this move from the card-centric world to real time. And I think if you look at the real-time opportunity in the U.S., some of the first use cases that are going to take advantage of real-time payments are in the Bill Pay world. So consumers having to pay bills at the last minute and ensure that their rent gets paid on the day that it's due, real-time payments is a good use case for that. Disbursement, so for our insurance customers, paying out insurance claims so that people who are involved in accidents or other tragedies, get their payments so they can move on with their lives. That's a really important use case that real-time is going to be a part of. And we -- there's been a lot of talk about when is real-time going to come to the U.S., and I think Bill Pay is going to be one of the leading drivers of that.</p><p>And then finally, in the Bill Pay world, this move from ownership to consumption, right? Craig talked about subscription billing. There have been an explosion of subscription opportunities in the e-commerce and the Bill Pay world, and there have been actually some very nice advances in the ability to offer and manage subscription services for everything from digital goods to also razors and even kind of traditional retailers and merchants are coming up with their own subscription services, there is an opportunity to improve the payment experience that's part of that. And we feel like we have a really important role to play to partner with some of these subscription companies to really be their payments partner and provide access to all of those endpoints, all of the high performance, all of the Payments Intelligence capabilities that we talked about to really drive that subscription billing opportunity in the future. And Dan is going to talk more about these things later.</p><p>So let's talk about merchants. So merchant has been a really nice growth sector for us. We've made big investments in the merchant space over the last 5-plus years. Growth is really being driven by e-commerce now. But our strategy is to provide a single omni-channel platform for all channels. So yes, e-commerce is important, but let's not forget, there is a tremendous volume of transaction still happening in in-store, and we want that experience for consumers to be a unified one, and we wanted to support all payment types and we want integrated fraud monitoring to be part of that. So going back to the trends, stand-alone payments moving to frictionless experiences. Nowhere is this more true than in the merchant space. Merchants are really wanting to build close relationships with their consumers. They want to build that loyalty and kind of have the consumers experience commerce through their brands especially when they pay. And we've made it easy with our API strategy for them to embed payments in whatever experience, whatever app, whatever loyalty and rewards program they want to provide to their consumers, we have made that possible. And we're even seeing that with Internet of Things, right? We've had companies that operate parking meters that want to make it really easy for consumers to pay their parking bills and payments is a key part of that. How do you make that easily to integrate, how do you make that a frictionless experience. So you get out of your car, you tap a couple of buttons on your phone, your parking meters paid and you move on with your life. So those are other examples where this frictionless experience is really just taking hold across the market. The other thing is this move from branded networks to Universal or cross-rail acceptance that Craig talked about. So I won't belabor this point because I think you did a good job talking about the example. But you have Chinese tourists going to Mexico City and wanting to use AliPay to pay. How do the banks, the acquirers, the merchants in Mexico City make it possible for those consumers to pay with their preferred payment method, but using the infrastructure that's already in place in a place like Mexico? Well, this idea of universal acceptance is how that happens. And we, with our global connectivity, with all of the payment types we support in our merchant business, we make that possible for those merchants to be able to do that.</p><p>And then finally, in the merchant space, responsible data use and kind of the kind of the opposite side of that coin is how do you protect those consumers from fraud. With the kind of global adoption of EMV and chip cards now, fraud has really shifted to the card-not-present channels. So think of it as the e-commerce, the mobile commerce channel. Fraud has spiked significantly in those areas. And because of EMV, liability is on the merchants, right? So for years and years and years, banks built up these very sophisticated, very large fraud teams to protect the bank when the liability was on them. Now that the liability has largely shifted to the merchant community, they need help. And if you think about a merchant's business, their first business is to take the order. They don't want to accept -- they don't want to sacrifice their acceptance rates in order to prevent fraud, they want the best of both worlds. And it's things like behavioral profiling and our Payments Intelligence capabilities that are going to allow that to happen. And Debbie is going to talk more about that later in her section on merchant.</p><p>And then finally, retail payments -- I'm sorry, finally, if I can move on to banks and intermediaries. So we talked about our retail payments business here is kind of our foundation. For a long time, it was largely a card-based world. Consumers use cards to pay in many parts of the world that ACI operated in, but that transition to real time has happened. I won't belabor that. I think Craig did a good job there. But when our bank customers talk to us what the last thing they want to do is stand up yet another infrastructure to support real-time and alternative payments. They want to be able to use the millions of dollars of investment and the years and years of expertise they've built in their existing platform, and they want to support both card and non-card payments on a single infrastructure. This has been a big investment for us. It will continue to be a big investment for us so that we can enable our customers to do that. The other thing is universe -- this concept of universal acceptance. And you think about it from a bank's perspective, the thing -- the assets that ACI brings to this table are, first of all, we have connectivity to DDA accounts globally, billions of DDA accounts globally, ACI software connects to, and that's the source of good funds, that's really important in this kind of universal acceptance world. We have global coverage, right? We are in key markets where account-to-account payments are really growing. India, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, the list goes on. And all of those endpoints I talked about earlier, that really makes ACI a smart choice for providing that ubiquitous access, and so continuing to build out those endpoints is our strategy for making sure that we can support that ubiquitous acceptance globally. Jeremy, later, is going to talk about what we're doing in India and how our partnership with Mindgate is really pushing us forward in this concept of digital overlay services. And that's really about turning transactions into experiences, and digital overlay services are all of the services and software applications that make it really easy for consumers and merchants and others in the ecosystem to accept and drive the use of real-time payments, and so we're really excited to tell you more about that story. And then finally, ownership and consumption in the retail payment space, it's the really -- it's the cloud deployment story. And so later, when we talk to Microsoft about some of the things we're doing with Azure, you're going to hear more about how this is becoming a reality, and this is a big part of our strategy going forward in the retail payment space, but really across our portfolio. So I'll end with this, kind of the key takeaways, kind of putting it all together. We have been and will continue to invest in product capabilities that set us up well to capitalize on those market trends, and that kind of wind in our sails. And as Scott is going to show you in a few minutes. Those investments are paying off in a really nice, high-growth rates in those areas that we really see as the future of the payments market. And those are the things that are going to propel us forward in this kind of new digitally transformed payment sea. And as I mentioned at the beginning, the size of the prize, we think we're really set up well to win more than our share of that 2.9 trillion transaction opportunity over the next 5 years. So with that, Scott, I'm going to hand it off to you, and Scott's going to take us into the financial picture that complements the strategy.</p><p>SCOTT W. BEHRENS, SENIOR EVP, CFO &amp; CAO, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Well, thanks, and good morning, everyone. I plan to just take a few minutes this morning touching on some of the -- kind of the trends in the key financial metrics that we look at to measure the health of the business. But I do want to start and thank John Kraft and Shirley Macbeth for coordinating this event. And more importantly, when we budgeted for this event, we thought we were going to have it in Florida. And when we moved it to New York, we lost about 80% of our square footage, but they stayed within budget. So it's a little cozy in here. Don't blame them for that, but I promise I'll get through this quickly and then we can take a break and you can stretch. So I'll start off really talking and Craig went into it a bit in his piece, our 2 P&amp;L structure. In 2017, we really started managing operating and reporting on our 2 P&amp;Ls. One is the legacy kind of more mature term license, software-based on-premise business. The other is our SaaS and platform on-demand business. That's a newer business. That's where we've put a lot of investment in over the years. The on-premise business, very sticky blue-chip install base, very healthy high margins. But this -- what's important here is this is still a growth business. And what you'll see coming up in the next slide is our growth rates in real time. That's -- one of the themes you're going to hear a lot today is real time, the trends in real time. Real time is our fastest-growing segment, and it is predominantly deployed as on-premise software. The second is retail payments as a driver, and that's really as we see trends in modernization. We've essentially modernized our IP, as Phil talked about, from a machine dependent to a multi-platform, Linux-based cloud-deployable. So really, where that business is going to get retail payments is going to drive future growth is really in our customers' modernization opportunities. And then if we look at the cloud business, 2 years ago, we put out, for the first time, multiyear EBITDA outlook. Typically, we'd only go out 1 year. We went out in early 2018, and we put up an extra 2 years of EBITDA guidance because what we saw in managing and operating our business under the 2 P&amp;L models, as we saw, we were at the inflection point of scale. We've invested a lot in our cloud business. That's investment in both physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure. So platform optimization, cybersecurity, and we were really at the point of scale. So we put out 2 years of forward EBITDA guidance, and we're tracking nicely to that. So we're really starting to see the scale.</p><p>Here's where I'm going to spend most of my time. We've talked for a number of years about targeting the mid- to upper single-digit revenue growth. These are our 6 solutions. What you can see here is we have 3 that are growing nicely at double-digit growth rates, real time being the strongest. We're very well positioned here, both from a technology perspective. We have the intellectual property, we're the leader in real-time technology, but we also have 40-plus years of deep, deep relationships with the banks and financial intermediaries that will ultimately power real-time payments. Merchant payments, as Craig mentioned, in particular, e-commerce is growing double digits and then fraud detection, our Payments Intelligence fraud detection and prevention is growing double digits. Where we're positioned, we expect those trends to continue. Turn next to kind of our mid- to low single-digit growers, bill payment, and again, these are 3-year CAGRs through 9/30 of '19, it's been growing at 4%. What we believe is in a part of our strategy of combining us with Speedpay, being able to cross-sell to the 2 customer bases, be able to combine the R&amp;D spend to bring richer feature function to market quicker. We're going to go through some of what that feature function is this afternoon, we'll really begin to move the needle on the biller side from 4%, and it doesn't take much. You get that into the 7% range, and it really moves the total because biller is such a big part of our business.</p><p>Retail payments. Again, this is going to be a function of customers refreshing and modernizing their technology. Again, Linux-based cloud-deployable, the total cost of ownership from independent studies have shown a 90% reduction in total cost of ownership in deploying a Linux-based solution. Digital channels has been a bit of a drag. That's really consists of really kind of 2 product lines: one is a consumer online banking and the other is a corporate cash management. The consumer online banking business we picked up with S1 back in 2012, we really -- it has not been strategic. It's basically attriting over the years. I think in this view, the consumer online banking component had probably north of $30 million of revenue in the base year. Now we're sub-$5 million. So that drag is coming to -- essentially to an end. And our refreshed Universal Online Banker product, which we introduced and presented back. And I think it was the 2017 Investor Day. That has seen a 10% growth rate in its early years since introduction. So a combination there of less drag on the attrition. You will be 6.0 getting more traction and growing at double digits. So again, I think, overall, 4%, but it's really going -- the driver is going to be -- we've got 3 solutions that are growing nicely in the double digits. Biller, we'll go through more of our biller strategy this afternoon. It's a big piece of the business. We just got to move the needle a little bit. Retail will be a refresh cycle. And then digital will ultimately see less of a drag going forward.</p><p>The next slide, this is just related to pick, if you look back at the base period and today, really highlighting that these 3 growth segments are not only higher in absolute dollars, but they're a higher percentage of the total. So obviously, as these get bigger, they're driving double-digit growth. It's going to move the needle in total as well. So going from under 20% to nearly 30% in terms of our double-digit growers. I talked about where we saw the inflection point back in early 2018, we put out multiyear EBITDA guidance. This is the profitability change over the last 3 years, specific to our on-demand business. So 2017, we were negative margins, 2018, we're marginally positive, this year, substantially higher in terms of EBITDA profitability. And even if you look at the organic side, so a lot of this is getting scale from the Speedpay acquisition. But if you look at just the organic portion of the business, our on-demand in the business, year-to-date, it's up 5% revenue, but 700 basis points on EBITDA. So we're getting the scale organically. Speedpay adds enhances the scalability and profitability of the cloud model. The EBITDA growth delivers very high conversion to cash flow. We have maybe 4% to 5% of total revenue in terms of capital or CapEx spending, mostly to support the on-demand business. We have very low and very efficient cash taxes and then the debt service on the interest, but we have very high flow. So the growth in EBITDA is driving growth in cash flow, ultimately, leads to a very healthy leverage model. I think if you look back at our past, when we have made acquisitions, we've generally used debt financing. So if you look in the even further back from this view where you'd see maybe a spike in leverage at the time of an acquisition, but we've been very disciplined about reducing leverage. We've targeted 2.5x, but the EBITDA, the cash flow generation allows us the flexibility to delever quickly. Two weeks ago, we went out with earnings, we reiterated our 2019 and 2020 guidance. 2019, we're comfortable with where consensus is lining up. And again, the 2020 guidance of the EBITDA $425 million, $445 million, we've targeted that. That's been out there now for a couple of years, and we're still comfortable with that.</p><p>So 5-year targets, again, going back to the slide on the revenue growth. We just need to move the needle a little bit to get us into that higher mid- to upper single-digit revenue growth, primarily in areas of biller and retail payments. That will drive high flow-through of revenue to EBITDA and subsequently, to cash flow. And again, over the time period, we're targeting 2.5x on our leverage.</p><p>So again, the investment highlights, large blue-chip installed base once installed, very sticky. We have a nearly $6 billion 5-year backlog from our installed base, transaction-based pricing, whether it's license software or cloud delivery, they're all tied in some way to transaction volumes or ride the secular growth and then high-margin software business, more mature, really harvesting the profitability of that business. And then on the AOD side, we're now just starting to get scale and get profitability there. So that trend should continue. So with that, and as I promised, a break, but I will hand it over to John for a few comments before we do. Thank you.</p><p>JOHN KRAFT: Thanks, Scott. Scott got us back on track. So we've got about a 20-minute break. Let's come back here at 10:15.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good morning, and welcome back. We're about to begin, we invite everyone to please be seated. We're going to begin shortly. Thank you.</p><p>JOHN KRAFT: Welcome back, everybody. Up next, Jeremy Wilmot, ACI, Group President On Premise. He's going to talk to us about our bank, financial institution group as well as our intermediaries. Jeremy?</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT, GROUP PRESIDENT OF ACI ON PREMISE P&amp;L, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thanks, John. So the On Premise P&amp;L is ACI's license, maintenance and services revenue business. It's predominantly focused on banks and intermediaries. So for the next 45 minutes, and you're not only going to be hearing from me, you're going to be hearing from our customers for more than half that time. But the next 45 minutes, I'm going to focus on the banks and intermediaries, what are some of the challenges they are facing, what is ACI's growth strategy around that. And then some customer testimonials, 3 actually. And I'll also be talking about India that Phil teed up earlier on this morning.</p><p>So the first piece of the challenges and the opportunities that are facing banks and intermediaries around the world. We've covered a lot of this. I'm not going to spend time on it. There are 3 major areas that I think about for the banks and intermediaries: number one, the democratization of real time; number two, the digital transformation of the customer experience related to real time; and number three, the technology refresh opportunity that's available to them.</p><p>So the first one, the democratization of real time. When we look at traditional past payment methods, they have been reserved for a portion of the world population, they have not been available to the entire world population. Real time open banking, provides the opportunity for banking and payment capabilities for the entire population of the world. It is a really big deal for large countries around the world, emerging markets, and that's why we're seeing markets like India really embrace the real time rails and to start thinking end-to-end how those real time rails are going to come to life for consumers and for corporates. And that leads on to the second area of the digital transformation of customer experience. Mobility is critical for consumers, individual consumers, you and I as we consume payments, but it's also increasingly becoming a necessity for the corporate world. And the mobile device, the digitalization of acceptance devices, the digitalization of onboarding of the payment experience. These are all the elements that the customer experience piece is transforming over time.</p><p>The third piece is around the technology refresh. It's been talked about many times around Linux, around machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as around the maturation of cloud. And cloud is really becoming a prime-time capable platform in order to significantly take out data center costs, which then, in turn, significantly enables us to take out hardware, software infrastructure costs, and it's the ACI software that's enabling the digitalization of that entire stack and the ability to spin up services in a very fast way.</p><p>So these 3 areas, the democratization of real time, the technology refresh as well as the digital transformation, they are redefining the business model in payments for the existing players. They are forcing strategic thinking around the competitive advantage of the bank and the competitive advantage of the different intermediary players that are sitting between the merchant and the banks as well.</p><p>So with that, how does ACI add value to banks and intermediaries in order to help them to win in this new paradigm and marketplace that we're playing in today?</p><p>So ACI has been serving the banks and the intermediary space for 5 decades. We're in our fifth decade of serving the needs of banks and intermediaries. We have about 500 banks intermediaries around the world across 6 continents. It's spread across 24 time zones. We are -- if you look at the G20 countries, 13 of the G20 countries, the ACI software is processing and powering the majority of electronic payments in that particular market.</p><p>So the global spread that ACI has is very impressive. When we look at banks and what's our value proposition to banks and what's our story to banks. The first one is around the DDA account, the current account, the savings account, it's the same thing. It's the everyday account that people are using. And to enable any payment whether it's real time or not real time, whether it's card or noncard, whether it's online or offline, any payment, that's what ACI software is looking to process and to manage that payment, to secure that payment and that's the -- for banks, that's really, from our perspective, the holy grail of what we're trying to provide them. And every time we go and talk to them, we talk about that DDA account capability.</p><p>We also have, which is a relatively new add for ACI and due to our strategic investment in Mindgate is the extension of digital services to that DDA account processing. And what we found in the real time world, which wasn't the case in the card world is ACI really needs to start providing use cases that have the end-to-end capability of processing the payment in the back end as well as providing the customer experience in the front end.</p><p>If you think about the card world, point of sale and the point-of-sale software, ATMs, the ATM software, ACI really didn't get involved at that front end of the customer interaction. But now that payment acceptance digital device is sitting in the pockets of the consumer, sitting in the pockets of the corporate. And we need to now digitally provide use cases and show banks, intermediaries, how you onboard clients and how you provide the sort of customer experience that's made possible through the real time rails and the digitalization. So that's a really key element. I'm going to talk about that from the context of the India marketplace and what we see happening in the future there.</p><p>In terms of intermediaries, global payment acceptance. So intermediaries want to provide their clients the ability to accept any payment, whether it's a traditional card payment or traditional ACH payment as well as an alternative payment method as well as any payment for real time rails. So a global network of payment acceptance. That's what intermediaries need, and that's what we provide them.</p><p>Secondly, the acquiring full-service capability in markets. There was a reference to a top 20 global bank who had stood up and spun up in 7 months, a new acquiring service for one of the large markets in Latin America. And that was with ACI's real time payment software, the payment management software we have within real time payments, the PRM software all deployed on Azure in that 7-month period. So that's a great example of that full end-to-end capability that we provide intermediaries.</p><p>And then lastly, payment as a service. So intermediaries are looking to provide historically, smaller banks, a full end-to-end payment as a service or lending platform as a service using credit cards and other unsecured lending methods as well. Increasingly, they're actually providing that for larger banks as well, which may be more to do with specific point solutions around ATM processing as an example, that they would look to -- the banks would look to outsource to an intermediary.</p><p>So the intermediaries are focused on the merchants and the banks. The banks are focused on the consumers and the corporates, and we'll be talking about all of that as we look at the customer testimonials.</p><p>So the last piece I'd say on here is ACI's ability to dramatically change the cost equation for banks and intermediaries through technology modernization, through Linux, through the cloud, through machine learning and AI and to bring out 80% to 90% of the unit cost of processing a payment as a result of doing that.</p><p>The monetization strategy for ACI as it tells these value stories for the banks and intermediaries, our monetization strategy has very much been around the transaction. We've talked to you about that. We look at our pricing strategy in terms of number of transactions that get processed and the more transactions there are, the lower they are on the price curve. In a real time world, we now need to further develop that pricing strategy, and we already are because, for example, in India, we're going to see real time transactions that will overtake card transactions by the end of next year. And then if you fast forward another 3 years, it can be 3x to 5x the volume in real time as it is in card today. So that requires us to mature our pricing strategy in order to win as much of the market as we can, and also to complement that transaction pricing strategy with the digital services that sit at the front end. And those digital services are all about spinning up use cases in a very fast manner to be able to spin up a use case for a demonstration in a matter of days, to spin up proof of concept in weeks and spin up an in-production capability within months, which is exactly what we've showed with that top 20 bank in Latin America with the full acquiring service.</p><p>So I'm going to move on to customer testimonials now. So I've talked about the market challenges, opportunities, talked about what ACI's growth strategy is behind that 4 -- 2 of our 4 segments, banks and intermediaries. And I now want to talk about a bank in Australia. It's very apt, I think, often, ACI in the past has been accused of old legacy technology that is not really appropriate for the new world. And what I like about this is Westpac was actually ACI's First International customer. So in the early '80s, we started in '75. We did all our business in the U.S. and in the early '80s, we signed up Westpac in Sydney. And they took on BASE24, used it for ATM, expanded its point of sale, and it was a great solution for them.</p><p>What they have done now is they have taken our real time assets, they've taken our PRM assets and with DDA account processing for real time as well as for card online and card offline, protected by our PRM capability, they've become -- they are the leading provider of payments in Australia, and we now would like to hear from one of the executives. So over to the video, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What we can say today is that we're live with -- well, we've completed our rollout. We're live with 9-plus million active accounts across all brands and across all business lines, consumer, business, institutional. NPPA published to the market that it had cleared $1 billion worth of payments in a single day. I think that's quite a significant milestone. Our tipping point, and I think the reality of sort of our customers and our use is the fact that we come in at about 30% of the volume of payment through the NPPA. But on that particular day, we were 45% of the value. So clearly, we default in the channel, we believe the customer experience is, everyone wants to get paid faster. And we're seeing the opportunity for that to happen, really being embraced by the market. Westpac at the start spoke about a progressive rollout of what's unique to Westpac is the fact that we're actually 5 brands.</p><p>So really, not all of those brands also have consistent systems that sit below it. So first and foremost, we wanted to make sure that the rollout was the best customer experience as we humanly can possibly do. And then the second thing is the whole concept with faster payments can be executed in 3 to 5 seconds. It's absolutely paramount that we have the best fraud and AML capabilities to ensure that the security of our customers is absolutely paramount. So upfront, we spent a lot of time investing and building new capabilities into our channels that validate a payment and why it's being made. What's pleasing for me is that '18 months down the track, and we've seen a reduction in fraud. It's a far safer set of rails. I think the real big hockey stick moment is when business customers and institutional customers really look at the way they make payments and really take advantage of that at API journeys, how you can do other capabilities. That part is huge, and we're really very excited around where this is going.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So there are probably 20 countries around the world where you'd see a similar testimonial from an ACI customer who would talk in very similar way to that in terms of any DDA payment coming through real time and a good proportion of them also use ACI for the card environment as well. So being able to put that all under one umbrella, have an enterprise fraud solution, have enterprise-wide merchant management and issuer management capabilities and to manage all your interfaces around that under one roof, that's incredibly powerful. There isn't another player in the marketplace who can offer that.</p><p>So that's a global view around the world. Let's come closer to home now and a very different customer, BMO. So BMO was not a customer, not a long-term customer of ACI. A few years ago, they embarked on a payment modernization process, went out to a very competitive tender to all of the players in the marketplace, they wanted to put in place a payment hub that was going to be sitting in front of existing systems to enable a faster market capabilities to launch new real time services and also to have some consistency around having a payment hub and the benefits of having a payment hub.</p><p>So we have today, Derek Vernon, who's the Head of Payment Modernization at Bank of Montr\u00e9al, and I'd like to invite Derek up on stage. Please give Derek a round of applause. Derek? Hi, Derek.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Thanks, Jeremy.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: How are you doing?</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: I'm great. Good.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: That was a good dinner last night.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Fantastic.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Yes.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Yes.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: So Bank of Montreal, eighth largest bank in North America, give us a little bit of background into the bank itself and also tell us a little bit about what your specific accountability is in the bank?</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Yes. Sure. I'd love to do that, and thank you very much for having me here today. So BMO, as you said, is the eighth largest bank in North America by assets, about $839 billion. We are also a very big player in the commercial payment space, both in Canada and the U.S., and it was really important for us to -- as we kind of step back and looked at our payments modernization journey, really, really important for us to choose a vendor. And quite frankly, I'd like to call you a partner versus a vendor. We've really built a great relationship with the ACI group of folks. So having that capability has really enabled us to accelerate our faster payment strategy and also set us up for success moving forward.</p><p>From a commercial banking perspective, we are also recently awarded best Commercial Bank in Canada. So we're pleased with that. So it tells me there's a lot of good indicators that we're on the right track in terms of expanding our capabilities for our commercial clients.</p><p>Myself, I've been with the bank for close to 21 years. I've been in a number of roles, both client facing as well as kind of back-office product management. A couple of years ago, looking at the payments modernization journey ahead of us and a lot of the regulatory-driven changes that the bank was facing, and we decided to put a full-time executive in place to be able to kind of spearhead and bring together all the different pieces that would be required. It's not just about technology. It's about the people, it's about the risk model changes and liquidity changes and universal banks, such as ourselves, have to make sure that we're set up properly obviously to not just deal with the regulatory impact of the change, but also to make sure that we can monetize and take advantage of all the new capabilities and grow our business at the same time, which is the strategy that we took.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. Great. Thank you, Derek. Thanks for that introduction. So we have financial analysts here, we have industry analysts here. I think the real quick -- we talked a lot about real time as ACI this morning. So for real time, what is the strategy of the bank? What approach is the bank taking to real time and why?</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Yes. So we're a very customer-centric bank. So really, it's about following the needs of our customers, first and foremost. Obviously, I mentioned the regulatory drivers that we have to make sure that we adhere to. You've heard a lot this morning about simplifying the customer experience and simplifying the payments experience, and that's been a big driver for us and utilizing the payment hub frame, I call it a framework versus a technology implementation because what we really liked about the ACI product right at the outset was it's not just software that you just install and move on, it's really about the flexibility that it enables us as we look to all of the new and emerging endpoints, some that we know today and many that we don't know. That's just a fact of life. Those new capabilities and new schemes and new markets that are opening up all the time, and we wanted to make sure that we implemented something that can help us connect to all the different legacy systems that bank as old as us, we're 202 years old as we are. And our technology is not 202 years old, to clarify that. But over the years, we invest in many new capabilities, and we have to make sure that it's backwards compatible if I can use that because you can't go and replace everything all at once. That's just cost prohibitive. But using the UP framework, it enabled us to make sure that we can have our eyes to the future, but also not have to replace everything behind. That was a really, really important driver to our business case.</p><p>So connecting to endpoints, I would say, is a really key driver, and also the simplification of the experience for our customers. So as we looked at how we're going to deal with all of the new things that we know today. So we knew that our customers were asking for connectivity to Zelle is known more as a person-to-person payment capability but there is a real demand for business-to-consumer payments where you don't necessarily need to know the bank account information. So the value in sending a Zelle payment for our customers, our larger commercial customers. So take insurance companies or it could be a class-action settlement for a lawsuit. We may not have the banking information for that end customer, the value in something like Zelle and the partnership with Early Warning enables us to very quickly be able to offer those new capabilities. And you've got that, you've got the Clearing House, which was mentioned earlier today. So just taking those 2 on its own and a bank our size and the fraud management systems and the anti-money laundering systems and the DDA systems and -- in order to build something, you don't want to be building it once each time. You don't want to build a connection to Zelle and have to figure out the orchestration to all of those different systems because then you'd have to do the same thing for a TCH payment, and I haven't even talked about Canada and some of the work going on there.</p><p>So using the UP product and putting it kind of in the center as that capability that connects all those different systems. It's really more of a build once, leverage many type of model, and that enabled us to very quickly implement. And I would say, from contract signing to implementation was about a 9-month period, which was probably one of the fastest deployments we've ever experienced, really committed team on both sides, heads down, was able to get that implemented. And then importantly, very quickly thereafter, we were able to implement new payment endpoints and new payment rails. So our first MVP, minimal viable product, was to expand an existing online FX capability, we use that as our MVP very quickly enabled that. And then only months later did we connect to Early Warning for Zelle. And then a few months later, we were able to connect to Mastercard Send, it is another payment vehicle for our Canadian commercial clients, giving them an alternative to wire payments, much more cost-effective alternative. And then very quickly thereafter, we've been working on connectivity to TCH. So you can see by putting in that capability, our resources are trained up and working with a close partnership with the ACI team, we're able to very quickly roll out new capability to customers. And I would say, in talking to some of my peers, I think they're pretty envious of the position that we're in the market right now.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Right, right. So talk about a 9-month implementation that was in the BMO data centers, right?</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: That's an on-prem implementation.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Yes. On-prem. And so I talked about the top 20 bank in the cloud. In 7 months, we're now talking about a large financial institution, 9 months owning their own data centers. And actually, the data centers within a bank are often the long pole in the tent for an implementation. So it's a relevant point to make. So we've talked about the bank, let's expand it out to Canada.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Yes.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So Payments Canada, I think, embarking on a modernization of the entire infrastructure of Canada. Tell us about, at a country level, what opportunities that's going to afford the players -- the payment players in Canadian...</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: So as I think about Canada, that's where I spent most of my time. Canada right now is embarking on what's called, not me saying it but what have others have said, is probably the most ambitious modernization journey on the globe right now. And there's about 80 different payments modernization initiatives if you look around the globe. And Canada right now is looking to replace its high-value system called LVTS. It's looking to replace its batch systems. So there's a system in place that manages, basically, the movement of money for everything other than a high-value payment. It's about 40 different payment streams that would be implemented and affected there as well as at a new real time rail. So why not do it all together? Because that's what we're doing. And why not also change the underlying risk model? So the Bank of Canada has decided at the same time as the systems are being replaced also to change the underlying risk models moving from, for instance, a deferred net settlement model to a real time gross settlement system. So if you kind of just step back and you think about that and you think about all the different banks, not as many banks in Canada as in the U.S., but there's still a number of stakeholders that would be impacted by this. It's very significant.</p><p>In addition to my role at the bank, I also am the chair of the industry steering committee for Payments Canada. So I sit alongside the Executive Director of -- for Modernization with Payments Canada. And there's a lot of work ahead of us. To kind of fast forward to ACI. We view the investment in that payment hub not just -- as I mentioned at the outset, not just to help us with the opportunities with Early Warning and Zelle and those types of capabilities, but also to enable us to connect to the new real time rail in the country. We've already used the UP product to help us advance our SWIFT gpi capabilities as we look to replace our own wire payment system in Canada, which is a 40-year legacy product, we've been using the UP product to help us connect that system to other internal systems in the bank like straight-through processing capabilities and new liquidity management capabilities. So it's been very versatile for us. And it's really enabling us and -- one more item, when I think back to the business case of putting in the UP product, there was a significant amount of cost avoidance that was in that business case because back to my point around replacing legacy systems by using the payment hub, it's enabled us to avoid having to make investments in some of these legacy systems and have that capability sitting there to help those flows.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: That's fabulous Derek, where you see the 00:00 down there.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Yes.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: So I think we're out of time. Yes. It's been -- thanks very much for giving us a great view. I think it's great to have that for Canada as we then continue to move around the world. So please, for Derek.</p><p>DEREK VERNON;BMO FINANCIAL GROUP: Thank you, thank you.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Thanks, Derek.</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So we're going to go to India now. And I was actually in India last week, we made our strategic investment in Mindgate approximately 4 months ago. We were there launching that with the National Payments Corporation of India and a number of the state-owned banks and private banks 4 months ago and had a lot of coverage. And 4 months on I'm glad to report that, that investment was a great decision. The impetus behind real time in India continues apace. The State Bank of India, which is the leading public sector bank, which has 440 million DDA accounts that the ACI software processes in what I think is the most efficient unit cost payment processing system for debit cards in the world. And the public sector banks, about another 4 or 5 of those that ACI has all follow the lead from State Bank of India. And then the private sector banks, who are not of that scale, but HDFC is one of those banks and certainly consider the leader in terms of services they provide to the marketplace and other private sector banks like Kotak Bank and other banks then follow their lead as well. They are all working extremely hard on the real time movement in India.</p><p>So UPI is what we all think about, there is also other real time rails there, IMPS, there's the bill pay digital service that rides on top of those rails as well. And what UPI has done that's so unique, and it's such a great case study for the rest of the world, is it's brought together that democratization point I was making in terms of mobile-enabled and mobile-originated merchant payments as well as consumer payments. It's integrated that with digital identity that is centrally held by the Indian government in the Aadhaar digital identity scheme, and it's brought that together with the UPI rail in a way that has -- and with the open banking interfaces in a way that any social media player, any merchant, any bank, any payment bank can launch new services literally within days into the India marketplace. And it has opened up the millions of small-to-medium merchants that are -- that have not been accepting electronic payments because a lot of their consumers don't have a bank account and it's opened that up to them. It has also mandated that the origination of the payment and the destination of the payment will be DDA bank account to DDA bank account.</p><p>So ACI had 10 of the largest banks in India, approximately 80%, 85% coverage. Actually, I think it's 90%, 95% coverage of DDA account in India. And we're working very hard with Mine Gate to provide that front-end digital service for any new payment service that a merchant or a consumer would want to bring to market. And we are integrating that via the UP framework into the ACI DDA processing systems that are sitting at 10 of the public sector and private banks. So let's move to the video so that we can hear a little bit more directly from India.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Excited about our position and responsibility in the Indian payments market to make this happen. And it's -- we believe it's a great model for the rest of the world in terms of the bank model of originator and destination in terms of being mobile first, in terms of being digital-identity enabled, and we're seeing that these are the critical elements of mass take up of real time payments. And what we love about India as well is the scale at which it's happening. So if you can process 440 million accounts real time and any payment, you can pretty much process any bank in the world in terms of the GPS requirements at the unitized costs that's the lowest in the world.</p><p>So very exciting. It's all about digital services, and that's a good segue to Associated Bank. We're also going to be talking about digital services. So the top 50 U.S. bank. It -- we're talking to the corporate side of the bank today. So the treasury management service, the corporate cash management service that the product managers and the sales teams within Associated Bank will go out to large corporates, medium corporates, small corporates. Compete against other regional banks as well as the national trillion-dollar banks as well. And Associated Bank have been a customer for approximately 5 or 6 years. They have recently launched our latest version of the UOB platform product that gets powered out of our data centers, and we have the Head of the Treasury Management business, Chuck Garcia, who is somewhere, who is here to join us, Chuck. Please welcome, Chuck.</p><p>Hi, Chuck.</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Morning.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Absolutely.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So Associated Bank, if you could give us a little bit of background into Associated Bank and also talk about your role just to give some life to that for people here?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Sure. So Associated Bank, very much a Midwest, middle market, full-service bank. We're in 3 states. Headquartered in Wisconsin, heavy concentration there. So not a heavy growth area, but also really extending ourselves in the Chicago land area, Minnesota, which has really expanded our need for different services. Then we also have satellite offices in 7 other states. My role, responsible for the Treasury Management business. And for us, at Associated, that is the product management area that you noted, the sales teams, the implementation and client delivery team. And then we also have a small marketing team.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. Fantastic. Now let's talk about the -- your customers and the customers that you have, tell us what the expectations of those customers are as it relates to this UOB platform?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Well, I think absent even UOB, the baseline is the system has to be functional every day, up on time, serviced all day, all accessible, the security that has been noted multiple times, that's just the going-in requirement. And so that's a number one. So whatever system we choose, that was -- that's paramount to us and our customer base. Really, we were on the enterprise banker platform. And I think it's important for the analysts to know, we actually went to a full RFP. So we RFP-ed with other vendors. Obviously, we chose ACI and the UOB platform. But frankly, our clients were fine. It was functioning fine. What it wasn't going to enable us to do is to extend it out in any material way and really leverage any of the capabilities that we wanted to have, we had roughly, I don't know, 3,500 clients on EB, but we were operating multiple channels at that point. So we were really only hitting our corporates at that juncture. And we're leaving a whole spectrum of smaller business, lower middle-market clients on the table that we knew we needed to bring in, not to mention the cost of operating multiple systems. So our real objective was to really be able to pull all of that together, create a much better user interface, user experience that we weren't going to be able to get and then obviously, the mobility of EB. But as we went through the whole process, we really looked at what -- not just what do we have today, but what will the future bring and we -- when you make a commitment like this, it's a 7 to 10-year commitment with a provider like yourself. And is there commitment to this product? Is there commitment to development to bring us where we need to be? So while we didn't have a customer base that was clamoring for something different, we were losing when we would go head-to-head with the BOAs and the Chases so they had their platform. And while ours was functional with EB, it did not show well, and we weren't winning in large scale opportunities. So it reinforced the road map that we really wanted to take and probably push this a little bit quicker.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So this move from EB to UOB. What -- can you talk to us a little bit about the business case and the business benefits that we're sitting behind that? How do you evaluate that? And where did ACI sort of win through on it?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: So it didn't honestly have a tremendous value proposition in terms of the true P&amp;L. So the business case was, are we going to be and remain relevant in this space? Thankfully, we have a CEO that is of the belief that this is entry into the system, entry to play. And so it was an investment that we knew we needed to make to be able to, again, remain relevant in this space and be able to compete at the levels that we wanted to.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Okay. So Chuck, you talked about competing. It's a rich competitive field of the national banks and as well as the super regionals.</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: You bet.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: How does UOB help you win new business and retain and upsell to your existing customers?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Well, first and foremost, again, it has good basic functionality, but the user interface and user experience has really been able to separate us out. Obviously, then it's incumbent upon us to win in a head-to-head battle but you have to have the right ability and capability within the product set that you're offering, UOB has really brought us to that level. We feel like we can absolutely compete on that level. And while mobility in our marketplace is not really a pressing item, it will be. We want to continue to push it out to our clients to make it more relevant, but it will be -- and we, again, we're not going to be able to compete on that basis. Today, we absolutely can. The product we have on the -- on the table today can compete with really anybody.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Fantastic. Partnerships, so you're competing in the marketplace, how important are partnerships to you as you look to win?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Well, they're tremendous. And it was noted in the last discussion, I really don't like the word vendor. We are partners. And it's a 2-way street. And any large-scale type of effort that we would undergo such as this. Our bank doesn't have tremendous assets from a technology perspective. We've come a long way, but we rely heavily on our partners to help us bring systems, bring technology, bring solutions to the fore. I think we have great ideas, but being able to execute upon that and bringing it to the marketplace in a reasonable amount of time in a period that we can deliver to our marketplace, not expend the tremendous amounts of our resources, but also then finally, ultimately, create the right customer experience. And then beyond, what are we going to do together to grow this business to help you grow the product, you help us grow our business and working in concert with that. It's tremendously important to us. We don't have the luxury of some of the larger banks of creating our own, so we have to develop and maintain those relationships.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Right. Right. Okay. Let's look at your sales team. So how is your sales team doing in the marketplace? Anything that you can actually declare and talk about here?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Yes. So we -- just for everybody's benefit, we just completed at the end of August, our final leg of conversion. So we took, again, I had in the very beginning, we had 3,500 clients on the EB platform. We now have 18,000 on the UOB platform. So we did it in 4 tranches. The last tranche included some of our more sophisticated heavy, heavy users so really, once we got past that last phase of making them comfortable, smoothing out those last wrinkles with those clients, we have really now begun to see the fruits of what we hope to have. So just before we actually did the final leg of the conversion, we had 2 pretty big pitches for significant clients of ours that had put their business out to bid. And then a couple that we actually were not the incumbent on. And I'm really happy to say, and I know you will be, as a big piece of it, we actually won. We kept the 2 that we needed to keep. And we've secured 2 new clients. And this is in a very short period of time. And actually, we actually demoed the product before we had it fully functional to a couple of the pitches because we knew we weren't going to show well in what they needed and expected. So real-life, real-time successes.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Fantastic. So before we wrap up and finish up. Any final thoughts or final points you'd like to make for the audience?</p><p>CHARLES GARCIA;ASSOCIATED BANK: Well, I think, first and foremost, again, for banks our size, we have to have really good partnerships. They have to be solid. They have to start out well, but we have to foster those over time. And again, that was a real tipping point for our decisioning. Again, we had the feature function we knew we would get right away. But really, the tipping point is, are we going to remain partners, remain relevant with you all and grow with you all, and we feel very comfortable with that. And so the other side is we hope to be a good partner on the other end.</p><p>JEREMY MILES MARIUS WILMOT: Right. Fantastic. Thank you very much, Chuck Garcia.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>JOHN KRAFT: Okay. So that brings to an end the On Premise banks and intermediary view. We're highly confident of our growth prospects in the space, real time, really is a great following win for us. And very much a global growth opportunity that ACI is pursuing.</p><p>So now we'd like to move to the ACI On Demand. Please welcome Dan Frate.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE, SENIOR EVP AND GROUP PRESIDENT OF ACI ON DEMAND P&amp;L, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thank you, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here with you. It's a lot of familiar faces in the crowd. And quite a few new ones as well. So as you've heard today, the AOD business is made up of a number of solutions. And what I am going to focus on today is that Cornerstone solution that was repeatedly referenced earlier in the day, Bill Pay. It's our higher margin, higher revenue, Cornerstone business. It's also led to the increased profitability that you saw in Scott's chart. And we're really excited about it because of the combination of the Speedpay. Speedpay business has given us the ability to invest in it in a way that can really differentiate and win. So if you go -- and much like Jeremy, you talk about the challenges and opportunities for billers. I think you've heard a good amount of this, this morning. However, I'd like for you to put yourself in the position of a biller, right? Because this is not core to what you do every day, right? And certainly, over time, the expectations around billing has increased significantly for the consumers, right? Their best experience on the web or best experience in a mobile channel is what they expect from you now. And you, as a biller, you're making tennis shoes or you're making car loans or you're providing utilities. It's not what you do on a day-to-day basis. And the bar is being raised as well. We talked earlier today around subscription billing. We are really excited about that opportunity as well. But you think about those subscription billers, and you think about the demands that they have. You think about your Netflix account. I think even in CNBC today, they were talking about how the level of subscriptions are actually getting millennials in trouble with regard to their debt burdens. And I think if we went back and looked -- and I know I did this morning, I looked at -- back at the number of subscription charges you have today versus just a few years ago. It's a real -- you can look at it from one vantage point, but it's a real growth opportunity for those billers as well. And even Nike have -- is going to put out a subscription process for their tennis shoes for children as they get older. And I wish I would have had that when my kid was young because he wears a size-15 shoe. And I think it would have taken Nike to the cleaners.</p><p>With that, too, the compliance around billing has become much more, call it, scrutinized and important to even the brand, right? I'm sure today, you also heard about the Disney streaming security issue in which if you signed up for Disney streaming over the last few days, you might want to go ahead and change your password and if you go back a couple of years ago, a few years ago, the breach at Target, actually ended with a CEO leaving the company. So I can't -- from a biller perspective, you -- I don't think you can talk about security at any length as being truly important to what they do on a daily basis.</p><p>So if you transition and you go back to ACI, and what we're doing with regard to billers and serving those billers, we're viewed as the expert. And we're the largest direct billing solution business in the U.S. We really focus on specific verticals. We talked a little bit about that earlier today. The utility vertical, the consumer finance vertical, the higher education vertical, the health care insurance vertical, and then, of course, the higher growth subscription vertical as well. You'll see a little bit later today, a demo of our patented moBills solution, excited about that. And you also have heard about disbursements and remittance. And you might not exactly know what -- how disbursements plays into the equation. But was that a significant consumer finance, auto lender located in the Southwest, in which they have, believe it or not, significant overpayments that take place on their monthly recurring charge for the auto loans. And today's process for them, and you probably have going through this process, is to manually send a check, you know 60 days or 90 days later, and sometimes you probably have all got a check in the mail, you want to know what the heck this is for, right? That's an overpayment. But with our services, we'll directly and immediately refund that customer either through a card or through their DDA or whatever payment mechanism they would want it refunded to. It's a significant opportunity for us to cross-sell. In addition to that, we offer our virtual collection agent, which allows our billers to collect more on their, call it, in that case, delinquent auto loans. So all of this is important for the billers because they know that it directly affects their Net Promoter Score because we also didn't bring up this. When do you typically interact with the biller, except for when you initially sign up, and it's that monthly process of paying the bill. And we know through research, and I think you'll also hear from one of our customers, that it has a direct effect on their Net Promoter Score. So not only is it important for them from an efficiency standpoint, but it's also really important to them from a customer security standpoint. And then last, what's on here is, as I said before, we provide the security, but we also provide the scalability. And so still out there, and it occurs even today because we know it, the 15th and the 30th of month will be tremendous increases in the volume of bill payments, right? And we have got the scale to accommodate that increase. And our billing customers don't need to worry about that and can count on us to be there on a 7/24 basis.</p><p>So we have rebranded the business to ACI Speedpay. We have invested a lot of dollars in the business. And we have also put a ton of talent into the business. One of the more exciting opportunities that I personally had is bringing the combination of 2 highly skilled groups of folks together to create the best-in-class skilled organization around bill payments in the country. I wanted to point out Sanjay Gupta there, on my left, is the leader of that business. And so feel free to tackle Sanjay at lunch if you have any questions around Bill Pay. And with that, too, I wanted to show you a video that will give you a little bit more color around what we're doing with regard to the biller solution at ACI. Want to roll it?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Thanks. My favorite comment in that is Alexa's hero comment. You want your customers to feel as though we're a hero.</p><p>Now I'm going to take a deep dive on a customer use case. We've got one of our customers with us today from Southern Company. Southern Company is a Fortune 500 company located in -- headquartered in Atlanta and is a long-time customer of ours. I think it was 1979 or '97. I think it's '97. Transposed the numbers. And it's a big moBills customer as well. And really excited that we have an individual who leads customer experience for Southern Company with us. And as I talked about, the experience is critical to the success of the utility.</p><p>So with that, let me bring on Louise Scott. Louise? And as I said, Louise heads up customer experience at Southern Company and is a Vice President. So welcome, Louise.</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Thank you.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Thank you for coming. I know this is a huge commitment for you. And -- but it's deeply appreciated. So let's start. Talk to us a little bit about Southern Company and your role there and...</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Sure. Sure. So Southern Company, as he's stated, it's an electric and a gas utility, headquartered out of Atlanta, Georgia. We're comprised of both electric companies, Georgia Power, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, amongst other companies within that umbrella and Southern Company Gas.</p><p>And Southern Company Gas was an acquisition made around 2016 that brought a gas utility, coupled with that traditional Southern Company electric utility. Probably some of you have heard of Southern Company in the past.</p><p>So I've led the customer experience side for Georgia Power company for many, many years. And with the acquisition, I moved over to the electric side -- or excuse me, to the gas side to lead their customer experience. And I love hearing the language that you all speak about when you talk about customers and being customer-centric because that is critical. At the end of the day, that's the accountability that I have leading the customer experience organization for Gas.</p><p>We have over 4 million customers. When you couple it with electric, it's 9 million customer, customer base. And their payments and their bills, I probably have a little -- I like to think of it anyway, a little more riding on them because if that payment isn't received, if that bill isn't received, what's at risk is your lights could go out or your gas service could go out. That's a little more to the game there. So it is very important. So we appreciate your customer centricity.</p><p>So we deal with all of those customers. We have, obviously, call centers. We have credit and collections and bill -- the billing side. And it's a fun world because I suspect in this room, does anybody walk into a location and make a payment anymore? Does anybody lick a stamp or stick a stamp?</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: No one's going to admit it.</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Do your parents? Do your grandparents? So we still have customers in all those worlds. However, the critical mass is moving digital. And we've got to match that need that they have, too.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Thanks, Louise. And what are your primary objectives as leading customer experience?</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Sure. So obviously, it's being a valued partner for our customers. But what we need to do, just is, as you all have said, with the investments that you're making in your technologies and your solutions is we need to stay first-of-mind for our customers, we need to eliminate pain points for our customers. So a lot of those pain points are about having the right solution for them to meet the need that they have. The example I give is that. As I said, we still have customers for some of our entities, those operating companies, you heard me talk about that have walk-in payment locations. So customers still do that. Customers still do stick on a stamp on an envelope. But we are getting critical mass, around 60% of our customer base pays in some digital format. Now that's getting big. And we have -- we still have pain points in that base because we don't have the right digital solution. That's where our Walletron came in. That was a great solution for us, a nice win for us in terms of shifting our customers to the channel that they wanted. So it's eliminated a pain point that we were seeing with our customer base.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Yes. I remember my dad going into pay the utility bill on a monthly basis because he didn't want those folks to have the money any quicker than what they deserve to have it. So those days are just about gone.</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: That's one of my pain points.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Well, great. So how does your approach to Bill Payments factor in to shape the overall customer experience?</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Right. So again, it's really deeply understanding what our customer base needs and what solutions match up the best to do that. One of the challenges we still have -- and the world is shifting and moving, but you'll find, probably a little more unique in the utility space is that we still pass that transaction fees on to those customers. A little by little, you're seeing our regulators allowing us to put those costs into a rate base or at least some sort of a rider to pass those costs along. So that's one little barrier that we're still pushing through, but it's getting momentum across the U.S. in any way in terms of absorbing those. So we wanted to create a new solution for our customers, looking at our customers who are, in fact, using electronic wallets, digital wallets, for other purposes for other bill pays. And we saw that momentum building and with long-term partners, who said with Speedpay, they brought this solution to us about Walletron. And it was really just the right time. We had seen the voice of our customer that's saying they needed something like that for us to deploy. And the timing was just right to do that.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: So that's great. And yes, thank you for being an early adopter. And so what has the experience been like, early on? And what lessons learned can we take from it and that sort of thing?</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Well, the experience has been terrific. I think earlier, you said that your banking systems weren't 100 years old. I think are our utility systems are 100 years? No. Not that bad. But we needed a partner that could integrate with the CIS Customer Information Systems that actually are 40 years old, 30 years old. And you all can do that. And you make it seamless, you make it reliable, which is extremely important to our customers. And the speed to deployment was so fast, way less than a year. And so late summer, we deployed Walletron to our customer base without a lot of fanfare, without a lot of advertising or targeting. And late summer, until now we've had 40,000-plus customers adopting the solution, which for our customer base, that is an incredible rate of adoption. Because those that were going to do digital really have already moved digital. These customers needed something special, a little nudge, and it hit the mark for us. And just very reliable processes. We've not seen in -- any issues whatsoever in the system. So, so far, really a lot of success.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Yes. And it does a couple of things, too, right? It -- not only does it improve the customer experience, but it also makes Southern Company much more efficient from a billing standpoint.</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Absolutely. You know the name of the game for any utility because we've passed those -- any cost of the utility operations on to our rate payers. And they have to be approved by regulators, so the name of the game is to be cost-effective. And when we have to print that paper bill and send it to you and then you pay however you need to. I mean that's dollars in costs where a digital experience, full, from the bill to the paying is cents. So it makes good business sense for us to do it. And it's efficient for the customer to do it. So it really is a strong opportunity for us to help us minimize our costs. Yet, we find our digital customers are more satisfied customer than a paper bill customer and other means of paying customer. So it's really a nice win for us and for the customer.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Yes. I know that's great. It's great for Southern Company. And great for you. So we're just about out of time, Louise. But any final comments?</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Yes. So I -- it's so -- what ACI is bringing to us is such a good world view of where other trends are going and other solutions that are being adopted by, not only utilities, but other industries that helps us possibly see things in our solution set that we don't typically look at or do. So we really appreciate that. I appreciate your partnership with us.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Well, thank you, Louise. And once again, thanks for coming. I know it's a big commitment.</p><p>LOUISE SCOTT;SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS: Sure. My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Once again, thank you, Louise. And what we're going to do now is, you've heard it referenced, I think, a number of times during the day, is to actually demo our moBills solution for you. In order to do that -- well, not in order to do that, but who's going to do that is Garrett Baird. And Garrett is part of our solution/product team at ACI and also, just so happens to be one of the co-founders of Walletron, which actually provided the IP for our moBills solution and is now is integrated into our platform.</p><p>So with that, let me bring Garrett Baird on stage. Garrett?</p><p>GARRETT BAIRD, VP OF PRODUCT, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: We'll pause on the action. All right. And we're ready to go. What I want to do is first, say, good morning, everybody.</p><p>And then what we're going to take you through today is a demonstration of the Southern Company Gas experience, looking at one of their operating companies, Nicor Gas based in Chicago. So one of the key pieces to this is providing customers many opportunities to enroll in the mobile solution, and Southern Company has done a fantastic job of that, providing the enrollment opportunities in a variety of different places.</p><p>Challenges of live demo, everybody. So what we'll do is show a video now of the enrollment process, and I'll just kind of take you through that customer experience now.</p><p>So the enrollment opportunities for customers, and for any of you who have loaded a boarding pass, or Starbucks Card into Apple Wallet, for example, the opportunity to place that pass into your wallet, you've got to have that one-tap opportunity, which we're going to show here. So on the Nicor site, for example, whether you're logged in or not to your account, you have the opportunity to enroll just by a simple tap here. And you can see those enrollment buttons down at the bottom of the screen on the Nicor Gas site. Customer simply enters in their account credentials, and they're off and running. If you were logged into your My Account, you would just have a simple tap to present the mobile itself to then add into your wallet as the screen shows here, customer sees his information, taps on that ad button, and then it's part of the wallet now that you can see there in and among the other businesses that I work with in my wallet.</p><p>Now what happens is because we have that present in the wall, we have the opportunity to light up the phone with a notification, reminding the consumer that their payment is due and then from there, they can go quickly tap into the past, tap on that PayLink, be brought right into the ACI Speedpay experience, and in just one more tap, be able to submit that payment on behalf of Nicor Gas. And there was no remembering My Account number, username, password. It was a seamless experience in just a couple of taps to go and make that payment. And in addition to that, we will send a follow-on notification, letting the customer know that we indeed received their payment, lighting up their phone once again with a message confirming that everything is good to go until your bill arrives next month.</p><p>And by the way, should you want to actually go and view your bill, well, we have that connected right to the path as well. So when we send a notification like the one you're seeing now, for example, you can quickly tap back to the path, go and retrieve your statement, just by tapping on the View My Statement link that's there. And then for anybody who wants to keep that collection of those electronic bills, you could also easily tap to save that down to Dropbox or Google Drive, wherever you might be housing any other bills. So you can see your historical usage or just have your lovely collection of bills in place.</p><p>The adoption rate and the stickiness is super. We've been blown away by it. So for example, 92% of consumers who add one of these passes to their wallet will keep that there for a year or more enjoying that easy, at-a-glance access to their bill information and an up-to-date snapshot of their account. And then the ability to link out to these other quick value-added services to have that end-to-end payment experience in just a couple of taps. Thanks, everybody.</p><p>DANIEL J. FRATE: Thank you, Garrett. And yes, the best laid plans, we went through it at least a couple of times yesterday and worked perfectly. But thanks for bringing the folks through the experience, Garrett.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to now transition to another portion of the AOD business. We talked about the Bill Pay business. Now we'd like to talk about our Merchant solutions that are both AOD as well as On Premise based.</p><p>And who's here to do that is Debbie Guerra. Debbie leads our Merchant mission. So give Debbie a hand. Thanks, Debbie. There you go.</p><p>DEBBIE GUERRA, EVP OF DEMAND MERCHANT SOLUTIONS, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Well, yes, that would be helpful. Well, good morning, everyone. I'm Debbie Guerra, I have responsibility for our Merchant mission, also provide leadership for our Payments Intelligence space.</p><p>I'm new to ACI. I've been here about 2.5 months, but I'm not new to Merchant and I want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the Merchant space and some of the trends, similar to what you've heard earlier in the day.</p><p>First, so let me give you a few definitions. So when we say merchant, what do we mean, right? It really could be a merchant of any size that we, ACI, can serve directly. And that's typically in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 merchant that could be global, could be multi regional or even a large domestic business. But it also could be smaller merchants that are served by intermediaries. And you heard Jeremy talk about our intermediary space, which could be a payment service provider, payment facilitator, an ISO, that also has relationships with merchants of all size in numerous geographies. And that's important to understand because the Merchant space, it taps into all the channels that ACI is so effective in working with.</p><p>And one of the themes have been about a sea of change that we're seeing in the payments space. I would say for merchants, it's like a tsunami of change. And a lot of it is really being driven by consumers and consumer preferences to be able to make a payment, any type of payment, whether it's mobile POS, in-store payments, ordering online, picking up in-store, delivering the payment ecosystem is really shifting. And this is creating a lot of opportunity for merchants, a lot of competitive challenges as well on how are they going to rapidly adapt to this consumer demand to facilitate an experience, a shopping experience, that will really allow the Merchant to retract and grow their business with the right consumer segments. And the payments experience is now so embedded that it's really critical.</p><p>So what have we seen? We've seen that the speed of change and the speed of demand driven by consumers is really creating speed of innovation that merchants have to be responsive to. But it also drives complexity, so when you look at -- let's talk about a global merchant that is present in multiple countries, has to accept multiple payment methods, may have to interface with multiple acquirers to have payment processing, the complexity of facilitating payments through their core systems in a seamless way and a frictionless experience for the consumer can be very daunting.</p><p>Similarly, the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly more complex for many merchants. We think about some of the new requirements that have evolved around the privacy of data, personal information that has to be protected, how to ensure that with the mandates that come from the card schemes that, that is being taken into account in the systems. This creates challenges for merchants who have to do that often in the past on their own and in the environments that are rapidly evolving.</p><p>We've also seen that omni-channel is increasingly important. I mentioned that, you don't just buy in the store anymore. You're buying online, you're buying with your mobile application. And then mobile POS, that mobile browser, that mobile experience. We saw it today just a minute ago with the biller, but it's very similar for the purchasing experience. So this omni-channel evolution is really right at the forefront of the digital expansion.</p><p>Additionally, we've got globalization occurring. So we deal with Merchants, a global furniture manufacturer, that we just lit up in its 25th country that sells both in-store and online. Global gaming companies that sell everywhere and really are driving a lot of the Christmas gifts that many of us will be giving to our children or grandchildren this year. Global capabilities in knowing how to get into new markets and to do it securely, quickly and in a way that addresses the unique requirements in that market can be daunting for companies to take on. And then the risk environment is changing.</p><p>So one thing that we've seen is you'll hear a lot of buzzwords around authorization, optimization and revenue growth. The company wants to really light up and turn on as many transactions that will drive revenue for them, but they need to do it in a way that won't result in fraud losses or charge backs. So it's that balance of being able to know who your customer is, how that customer is going to pay, to be able to profile buying behaviors and to confidently approve as many transactions as possible while at the same time, balancing losses, balancing charge backs. And so fraud, merchant fraud solutions are really critical to a merchant's ability to really drive revenues up, but do it in the safest way possible.</p><p>And then at the same time, we've got this trend towards the cloud, whether it's Software-as-a-Service in the public cloud or whether it's on demand platforms delivered through ACI's private cloud, we're increasingly seeing our Merchant clients and the intermediaries that we work with, really adopting this move to outsourcing, right? So a lot of trends that I think are converging in the merchant space today. So with opportunity comes challenge. And when we have those challenges, ACI solutions really can help our merchants overcome it.</p><p>We've got a global network of acquirers and alternative payment methods that is increasing. With over 250 different choices and alternative payment methods, we really can provide the single largest global payments gateway and global payments platforms that merchants can take advantage of. And I think, as Mike mentioned earlier, that's increasing rapidly with about a new -- 100 new payment methods that are coming to the market annually. And with a technology structure around our endpoints and facilitation of endpoint development and connectivity that is really underpinning that.</p><p>We talk about alternative payment methods, whether it's Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, WeChat Pay, Alipay. I think this week, we had an announcement that Facebook Pay is coming. The next one, it's really never ending. And it's all about this disruption of some of the more traditional pure card acceptance and really moving to a differing ways of driving payments. And in order to reach the consumers who want to pay with their choice of payments, it's really essential that the ACI solutions can facilitate tapping into those different alternative payment methods. Additionally, when we talk about the omni-channel experience, we have a platform that really facilitates across multiple industries in-store, online, mobile commerce solutions, whether that's in general retail, grocery, it can be C-Store with fuel solutions. It can be online gaming types of customers. And it's -- we are really positioned to deliver that omni-channel capability. And omni-channel itself is evolving, we have a global car rental company that we do a lot of work with. And they're spending their time really updating, think about it, their reservation systems. But it's not just to handle traditional reservations that they deal with. It's about how they can compete with rideshare businesses or with millennials that don't really want to ever buy a car, but may only want to use it on a subscription basis. So we have to think about what does that mean to how that service in the future is paid for. What's going to shift for fraud for a company like that where in the past, somebody would show up with their card, with their driver's license, it was an in-person transaction with a contract. In the future, you could have a consumer showing up with a card to a location that's unattended, and then they need to be able to access the service, the car that they're getting into. So how those companies evolve and really address what is a changing omni-channel space is really interesting.</p><p>And then also security. So let me spend a little time on security. One of my big exciting finds with ACI in the last few months has been our merchant fraud solutions. We have more than 20 years of merchant fraud experience with machine learning, adaptive rules engines and all predicated on a multilayered approach that takes advantage of a global consortium of data. And this is not just on the merchant fraud side of it, but also leveraging our proactive risk manager. Jeremy mentioned it that supports a lot of our banks and intermediaries in their issuing space. This really allows us, particularly for e-commerce, to be able to ensure that our merchant clients are really able to tap into this authorization optimization, growing revenue. At the same time, that they're able to know who they're doing business with and to understand where the fraud and the challenges exist.</p><p>So it's an exciting space. I want to spend a little time with an example. We have a customer out of the U.K., the Co-op. The Co-op is really a multifaceted retail services company with about 2,600 locations, both in-store food retailer as well as fuel services. And they were looking for innovation in the mobile in-Aisle application that would allow a consumer on their own device to scan the items that they're going to purchase in the store on the device and at checkout, the cost is deducted directly from either their Apple Pay or their Google pay accounts. We were able to help them with our Universal Payments -- Merchant Payment solution that included a mobile SDK to facilitate development of the application, our PAY. ON Payments Gateway that I discussed earlier as well as our Castilian omni-channel platform. So why don't we listen to the words from the Co-op.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DEBBIE GUERRA: Thanks. It was great to hear Paul talk again about the strategic partnership with ACI and how the security and reliability of our solutions helped him to sleep, which is great. We rolled this out to about 30 Co-op stores, jointly with Co-op, late this summer across England, Scotland and Wales. We look forward to the broader expansion of this solution across Co-op's footprint in the U.K.</p><p>So talking about innovation, I really want to hand it over now to Eve Aretakis. Eve leads our product development and delivery organizations, and I think you're going to find it really exciting to hear about where our products are going in the future.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS, EVP OF APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thanks, Debbie. Thanks. Go ahead. So we're almost to the end. And I'm going to talk about technology, but without talking about technology. So let's see how we do on that.</p><p>So first, there's been a lot of talk about deployment options. And you've heard through many of the speakers that we talk about public cloud, On Prem, ACI private cloud, where we're actually the operator, and really talking about giving customers choices in terms of which of those journeys they want. And in many times, they want hybrids, several different journeys at the same time, which we're capable of delivering. But most importantly, regardless of the choice they take, we can deliver on a whole number of important characteristics, availability, scalability, reliability, and then, of course, migration options. So we see many different customers looking at how can they move not only their technology from one deployment to another, but also leverage things, dynamics that are happening in those markets. You've heard about the move to Linux, also moved from a big proprietary database solutions to open-source databases. So there's lots of other dynamics that we see customers wanting to take care of in some of those movements and allows us the capability to give them that flexibility as they move between the different kinds of deployment options as well as exploit those deployment options depending on geographies. So it may be that they're On Prem in one geography, but they may want to go into a public cloud in another geography.</p><p>So with that, you hear a lot of dynamics about the move to public cloud. So let me actually talk more about public cloud. And what better way to do it than introducing one of the leaders in the public cloud, Microsoft. So help me in welcoming Peter Hazou, Director of Business Development for Financial Services from Microsoft. Thanks, Peter. Have a seat.</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: Thank you.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: Welcome, Peter.</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: Thank you. Great pleasure to be here.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: So I know we're hearing -- and today, we heard a lot of different applications where there's move on to public cloud, and some of them are motivated by changes in how our customers are investing, whether they go from CapEx to OpEx, scalability, lowering their cost of ownership in terms of the hardware and infrastructure, being able to do just-in-time growth in hardware. What's your view on this changing dynamic and the opportunity space?</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: So I think, first, it's important, and I've -- we've heard a lot about it today, but I want to just highlight a couple of things to our experience at Microsoft. I think it's important to look at the context of the changes in the industry in payments because it's really, frankly, unique inflection point that a lot of us have been in the industry for many years myself as a banker, have not come to this experience. There is a couple of things you referred to the CapEx, OpEx. But there's a fundamental change in the business models. Banks must reduce the run-the-bank costs. There's a long history of how it's built up. The way it is built up, but the point is interest rates are structurally low, bank business models are under a lot of pressure to modernize. And so there's a lot of work around that. That's really one of the 2 great things prompting cloud deployment as the first option at a lot of banks. I'll talk about that in a minute. But let me talk about the second big change. Payments, traditionally, was a bank franchise, bank-on-bank and it was a level playing field. But a lot of what we heard today and a lot of what we see in the industry is that there are these big tech and fintech companies that are born in the cloud, that are really taking a lot of this market share for convenience for whatever the driver underpinning it is. But the point is that banks need to adjust. They need to be more agile to compete and they need to face a very different level playing field with more in the cloud, nonbank competitors.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: That's great. What about -- I mean one of the things that was at least previously a blocker, was some of the issues around security, compliance, et cetera. What are you hearing about that dynamic and change in terms of the willingness of banks to go into the public cloud?</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: So I think somebody here mentioned a tipping point, I think it's more, the dam is broken in terms of the issue about the public cloud. Microsoft is deeply an enterprise company. So we empower banks. The banks need to compete in this new space. And that's a lot of what we do. So our primary focus as a cloud for our partnership with ACI is we focus really on the compliance. Microsoft is hugely connected in with the CIO function at banks globally. So we've had a real focus. It's a deep technical explanation about how the security elements work. But in a lot of senses, the cloud is about new architecture around data and security and privacy. It's a global cloud with local data centers. So there's a lot that has gone into the process about local -- to keeping data locally in jurisdictions where required. So it's really a fundamental change. We've been working with regulators for 7 years and adopting ourselves, adopting our cloud to be able to empower enterprise banks to be able to modernize these.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: And what about -- so I mean we know that the data security is a hot topic, like you talked about. But what about also the migration. Some view it as being too complicated to get from On Prem into the public cloud.</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: Partly, the hybrid story is there, but I think a bit, which was referred to earlier, the need for banks to reduce the run-the-bank costs. I mean I worked at a bank. It took 4 years to roll out a simple payment hub. With ACI, we're working together on a major, major bank that's gone live in 7 months end-to-end from the beginning of the discussion. I mean in my career, I never would have conceived that. But it is really at all the banks. We thought initially in discussions with ACI, there will be smaller banks, they don't want to run data centers, they want to modernize. But in fact, it's being led a lot by the G50 banks. The very large banks, plus the Tier 2 banks, they all need to modernize their infrastructure. And everything is going in the direction of the cloud. All the big banks have got big cloud projects, frankly, about payments. So it's really a big point of transformation. So once in a generational shift, I would say, from the On Prem expensive-- more expensive models to be able to be more agile and compete.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: Okay. Great. So let's just talk a little bit about Microsoft and ACI. So Microsoft, obviously, a leader in cloud, ACI, a leader in payment technology. What's been your view about the combined offer between the 2 companies? And in terms of bringing value to the marketplace to really differentiate for our joint customers.</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: So the way that we're working very well actually with ACI is as follows. I mean these are big complex systems on banks. So there's no simple answer. They're complex. There's a lot of history involved, a lot of back-end systems. But Microsoft would through our enterprise sales force covering the banks globally. As we've done for years for our own first-party stack around office and CRM and those things. We have the coverage, but we're really more focused on the IP side and the ACI colleagues because of their tremendous expertise in payments are more focused in on the payment side. Put the 2 together, triangulate. It's the best way to make a solution. So we're working very closely in co-sell. I would say, in terms of working with clients to explain not only the what, but the how it would work. And we have a lot of expertise that comes to the table to help in that transformation.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: So let's go back to one of your comments about our really exciting, big joint win in Latin America. In your mind, what are some of the top characteristics of that win that you think are attributes we can replicate around the globe?</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: Well, so traditionally, to do a new system requires a lot of testing, it requires a lot of development. Doing those elements in the cloud actually are just much faster. The cloud is very agile by design, and that's how it's utilized. So there was a very agile approach to how this could be deployed in real time and all the other elements because that particular deal has got some financial crime where ACI is a leader through the payments intelligence suite that you've got, also the switching. There's all these different elements require some HSM in the cloud for the keys and what have you. And really putting that together with a very focused team. I mean it's -- for many of us in the business to see it be an end-to-end 7 months and being live, it's just really something.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: No. That's great. So just any closing thoughts you have for our audience here?</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: I would say, look, there's a lot to the story. Technology is changing rapidly. The market is changing rapidly. But I would say -- and a lot of the joy that we've got in terms of working with ACI, at the end of the day, financial services is a people business. And you have really great people that we enjoy working with. And I think that's what really makes customer solutions work well. You get in, you're focused, you both bring a lot to the table ourselves, yourselves when addressing customer change. And change management is a big challenge at the banks. It's really what we've seen is the best approach.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: Great. Well, thank you, Peter, for joining us and sharing your thoughts on moving to the public cloud. Thanks again.</p><p>PETER HAZOU;MICROSOFT: Thank you.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: Okay. So let's very quickly talk about some of the things you've already heard throughout the morning, in terms of some of the modern technologies that ACI is already using in our products and our services. And keep in mind that many of those modern technologies we use, you're already seeing or consuming in other services on the market. So in terms of some of the brands that probably are very familiar to you, companies like Uber, Amazon, Netflix. So when you think about some of the pieces of the underlying technology, Uber, in terms of making the service, the payment service frictionless. Amazon, in terms of adapting a platform and you think about a platform within a platform of all the ways that you can partition Amazon services into offers for specific customers. And then, of course, in terms of Netflix, using and leveraging APIs. You look at some of the things that are very attractive and sticky in Netflix and how they reuse capabilities that have already been built. Showing you where you are in-stream to something you're watching, figuring out other things that you would like to watch, based on what they saw your patterns were before. So all of these are using technologies that also are being used by ACI. Of course, we're also complementing those technologies with some of the other very, very strong capabilities we have around the globe.</p><p>We talked earlier about endpoint factory. One of the things that we find is that regardless of which solution our customers are deploying on ACI, we don't need to reinvent different types of payment types that we can use those from one solution type to another. That's what's enabled from our endpoint factory, and that endpoint factory can be hosted in the cloud, in ACI cloud, On Prem, et cetera. So customers can share in those assets that are already been built. And then, of course, supporting customers with self-service and APIs.</p><p>One of the things that we find, and you see this in many industries, is that customers want to use core technology, but they also want to have the option to differentiate and be able to create use cases. So one of the things that we've built and enabled is a developer portal and sandbox that allows our customers to actually go in and build new services to their specific industry segments and their applications. It gives them a chance to not only trial a new service and figure out its stickiness to a segment in their customer base, but also figure out how they would deploy and service that offer as well. All of those are done through a number of different choices. Customers can leverage our road maps or they can use some of the different capabilities via the Sandbox and build and enhance off of their own build. And we see customers that are doing those builds themselves using our UP Framework or actually having third party or partners help them build some of those services to enable an offer. You heard about some of those examples today. And one of the things that we see is we're able to share some of those core assets across the different technology platforms that we talked about. And of course, the customer can also control the pace of that innovation, whether it comes off of our road maps or comes off of some of their own builds. So let's actually do a demonstration of our solutions in action. So with that, I'm going to invite Craig Ramsey up here to do a little demo.</p><p>CRAIG RAMSEY, HEAD OF REAL-TIME PAYMENTS, PRODUCT MANAGEMENT, ACI WORLDWIDE, INC.: Thank you, Eve. Thank you very much. Yes, I'm Head of Real-Time Payments. I'm going to do a demonstration or at least I'm going to try to do a demonstration. They said, relax, what could possibly go wrong? You'll be second. So here we are. So let's just see whether the tech's working. How are we doing guys? Well, good. Okay. So I'm going to talk about Request to Pay, also known as RTP or, indeed, RfP, Request for Payment. And really, there's 2 models that Request for Payment works for. Firstly, there is the pool of payment -- pool of funds from a customer's account in an instant manner, so as requested, and that's what we're going to show today, or indeed, there's a biller opportunity here for a Request for Payment to be sent some days or hours, weeks even, before the payment is due and then a delayed response from the consumer to actually pay the instruction itself. And really Request for Payment is one of those digital overlay services that Jeremy spoke about earlier. It's the reason for why you want the real-time rails in the first place. And secondly, it also brings together that full end-to-end payment chain, whether it's from the merchant, the actual initiation point, through the financial intermediary, all the way through to the bank and ultimately to the clearing and settlement system. So it's an end-to-end example of a real-time instruction, and those APIs interacting in order to actually make the payment happen. Lastly, the point I do want to make is Request for Payment actually isn't a payment. Request for Payment is a message that then results in an ultimate payment happening, okay?</p><p>So let's go ahead and do the demo. You always get an insight to someone's life when you see their home screen, so let's go straight out of there. And what we'd do is we'll tap to start and get on with it. Now at this point, I'm actually representing the merchants portal, so this is an e-commerce merchant. So we're online, but just as simply, we could also be in a bricks-and-mortar store, where, ultimately, the Request for Payment can also happen in real time. Now in an e-commerce merchant, typically, someone will have registered with their email address, they would have given their mobile phone numbers. What they haven't given at any point are their account details. So that's where alias databases work in the background, in the clearing and settlement mechanisms, to link those e-mail addresses, those phone numbers into those account details and give access, but without having to provide those account details to the merchant themselves. But the only person that knows the banking details is the bank.</p><p>So let me go ahead and pretend I'm registering here. This is where my typing skills let me down, so just bear with me. I'll even use a real email address. Will be ACI, aren't we? Select the country. It would be so much easier when we've left the EU, the United Kingdom, because we'll be right at the top. We're renaming the country to simply say alone. We're down here somewhere. Here we go. There we found them. So we'll sign up to marketing because I want to be part of that 93% that Phil referred to. So here we go. So here we are, we're in the merchant site, and we're going to buy some rather snazzy ACI socks. So I'm going to select the pair of socks, there they are. They're EUR 5.99, very nice too. And at the bottom, I'm still in the merchant site, and it's asking about how do I want to checkout. And one of the opportunities is to checkout with a real-time payment. Now the merchant might prefer to use that versus a card or any other type of payment because it can give them some benefits. It might reduce their interchange fees, they can also get instant and real-time access to liquidity. And what I mean by that is the payment, because it's an account-to-account transfer, will instantly go across into that merchant's bank account. Now for a pair of socks, I'm guessing they're not going to be too worried. 1 million pairs of socks, it makes a big difference or high-end hi-fi or any other large purchases where retailers can actually reduce their stock inventory by having real-time access to funds. They can then resend that on instantly to a factory and get things shipped from a factory. So they're not having to hold as much stock.</p><p>So we're going to go ahead and press yes I'm going to do that real-time checkout. Now at this point, this is where the financial intermediary and the APIs kick in. The financial intermediary supporting that merchant said, thank you very much, we're going to now look at ways of making that real-time payment. And they will hook up to the different banking system's APIs. And we've got our fictitious bank, PD Bank &amp; Trust, sitting out there ready to do a real-time payment. So I'm going to say, yes, I want to pay with them. And you'll notice that the user experience has now changed. I've actually moved now into my bank's portal, accessible over the API. And instantly, I feel more comfortable. This is a place I recognize. This is a banking experience I recognize. So I'm going to go ahead and select the account I want to use and I'm going to pay with real time. It's going to run through the biometrics of the phone. So again, I feel nice and comfortable that it is happening according to the experience that I expect. Success, the payment has happened. Return to merchant, and now I'm back at the merchant website. The payment has been successful and the socks are shipping. And miraculously, I do believe the socks have arrived. I mean that's instant and real time. Now I know what you're thinking. That's a great user experience, and it's a way that we can actually show that end-to-end ecosystem going on with real time. The other thing, too, you'll be delighted to know, socks, if you'd give me your EUR 6, ignore anyone else outside telling me differently, I'll accept dollars as well. You'll find socks in the lobby during lunch. Please help yourselves to pairs.</p><p>EVANTHIA C. ARETAKIS: Thanks, Craig. Okay. So just in wrap up, I think throughout the applications that you've seen today and the user experiences and the verticals that we provide solutions to, you can see a lot of the underlying technology at work. So first, user experience. Through a lot of the apps, you can see that we make that very convenient and seamless, and allow our customers to integrate to their user experience, their front ends as well as present a logical way that they can plug-and-play with the pieces we provide. We obviously have a number of powerful services that you can see deployed: our [e-cover] solution powering online payments for merchants, Payment Intelligence (sic) [Payments Intelligence] for fraud screening, and a number of other very important characteristics and capabilities that you saw through a number of the solutions and demos today. Obviously, the mobile SDK, it powers the mobile apps. At the point of the payment, the consumer is able to use our real-time payment and other types of payment types and integrate those seamlessly into their offers.</p><p>You can also see that we can support a number of devices, whether those devices are coming in with mobile, and depending on where you are around the world, how those are integrated into overlay services. Jeremy talked about Mindgate where you can integrate into some of their overlay services so you can integrate the payment type in WhatsApp as well as some of the other services that are prevalent in the Indian marketplace.</p><p>And then, of course, the APIs that allow us to create a frictionless set of services but also a wealth of opportunity for our customers to leverage pieces of software that we have already built, and be able to apply differentiation to that software to solve either a vertical or customer problem. It's a great example of how we intend to roll out these new services and make them extendable in reach to all of our verticals. So this is a great example of how ACI's Any Payment, Every Possibility at work, and hopefully, a way that you can see what we're creating for what's next. So now I'll turn it back over to John Kraft for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JOHN KRAFT: Thanks, Eve. Exciting stuff. It's now time for the Q&amp;A. I'd like to ask Phil and Scott and Craig to come to the stage. It's your opportunity to ask questions to all three.</p><p>DAVID LUKE ELLER, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: David Eller from Wells Fargo, back here in the back. I have 2 questions. Before we get started, I was glad to see the Wells Fargo card in the slides, glad to be a proud partner of you guys. Craig, in your talk, you talked about the growth of subscription payments, e-commerce. You mentioned streaming companies, razor blade companies. Can you give us a little flavor for some of the logos that you've won that maybe have been publicly disclosed? And then also for the logos that haven't come over yet, like what are the impediments to getting those on your platform? And then my second question is on cash flow. You talked -- you reiterated your guidance for this year for EBITDA and cash flow. Could you give us an idea of what that cash flow number might look like next year as we reach that $425 million to $445 million of EBITDA? And how are you going to spend the cash flow?</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS: Right. Those are 2 very different questions. So we haven't disclosed a lot of logos on the subscription side. Suffice to say that we've got a very long or a good plan over the next few years. The one that we have discussed, we actually mentioned in our earnings call last week. Lime Light is an e-commerce platform. They do subscription life cycle management, and they've actually integrated with us and have selected us to provide the e-commerce payments behind their subscription life cycle management. So that's probably the best example that I would throw out at this stage.</p><p>SCOTT W. BEHRENS: Regarding cash flow, I would say, next year, we should convert about a consistent percentage of EBITDA to cash as we are this year. Regarding uses of cash, I think we're going to be consistent with what we've done historically, probably about 1/3 of our cash on share buybacks. We were in -- in Q3, we had an opportunity to get back in 1/3 on debt service and then 1/3 on opportunistically looking at tuck-in type acquisitions.</p><p>BRETT RICHARD HUFF, MD, STEPHENS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Over here. This is Brett Huff from Stephens. Thanks for having us all here. This is a great day, as always. Two quick questions. One, Scott, you mentioned that kind of mid-single to high single-digit growth rate over time. In the past, it's been near-term low, medium term mid and long term high. Was there a nuance in there that we were supposed to take from that? Or is it very much the same?</p><p>SCOTT W. BEHRENS: Yes, I think it's the same. I don't -- the whole point of showing it by the 6 solutions versus looking at it in total, is we do have solutions that are at double-digit growth already. So it's really about taking the biller business, moving the needle a little bit, and that's a big part of the business, will help drive us towards high single digit. So the point was really saying we're not -- not all 6 solutions really need to move the needle that much. We really need to do it on biller. We need to do it in terms of refresh cycle with our customers on the retail payments, and we need to see digital start to stem its attrition rate. So nothing to read into that other than just saying, we just have to move the needle a little to bit until we get to those longer-term targets.</p><p>BRETT RICHARD HUFF: Okay. And then second question, on free cash flow. Free cash flow has been choppy over the years for good reasons. Can you tell us, will that free cash flow get a little bit more consistent with how EBITDA growth happens? And how do we get there from the choppiness maybe that we've had in the past? What's changed?</p><p>SCOTT W. BEHRENS: Well, I think on the licensed software side of the business, we're always going to have the choppiness. And there's really 2 components for that. One is fourth quarter is heavy with renewals, so it's heavy with both -- with billings. And then we have an annual cycle for a lot of the product support fees that are paid annually and then recognized on a recurring basis. But I'd say, with the addition of Speedpay and its, call it, $90 million of annual EBITDA, and that's recurring revenue, it's recurring margin, and it's highly recurring on a cash flow basis. So just the mere layer on of Speedpay is going to smooth out more of that cash flow because it's all in AOD business.</p><p>GEORGE FREDERICK SUTTON, PARTNER, CO-DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, CRAIG-HALLUM CAPITAL GROUP LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: George Sutton. First, I want to say thank you to Dan. I feel a lot better having 4 kids in various forms of higher education. You call them payment opportunities. I feel a lot better about that. So I think the word of the day is scale and the ability to potentially scale. There were 2 things that were brought up that I thought were very interesting relative to that and that was partnerships and integrations. I wondered if you could talk about kind of where you are there today. And then also, I think it was Phil that mentioned, you envision 1/10th of the number of players in the industry over time, but 10x the volume. And I just want to make sure I understood ACI in that future.</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY: So do you want to talk about the partnerships, and I'll talk about (inaudible).</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS: All right. So to the question on partnerships. We've got a whole diversity of partnerships. It's actually amazing, the ecosystem has been bought around ACI globally. We've got lots of implementation partners that take care of some of the implementations and help us there. We have partners at that extreme, for example, you heard Microsoft talking about cloud, and that's a very important set of partnerships. And then within each of our solutions, we actually have a myriad of partnerships. So if you look at the bill payment space, for example, we have a large number of integrations into the back office ERP systems to give you that end-to-end customer life cycle experience by being able to get to the bill data. And so in all the different verticals we work in, we've got some key partners. So for example, in the mortgage servicing space, Black Knight is a partner; in the higher education, Ellucian is a partner; and so on. So in the biller space, a lot in our merchant solutions, we work with a number of the point-of-sale providers and so on. In our retail payment solutions, we've got a number of partners that would provide complementary services, and the list goes on and on and on. The bottom line is the whole point about openness and ability to provide end-to-end solutions where you're able to integrate and provide a seamless experience, like you saw and heard earlier on, is an important part of the model, and will continue to do so.</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY: Is [Shirley] here? Shirley , can we put the slide up that we didn't go through in my presentation? Right. Saved it for the last. All right. Because I do want to talk about -- this whole endeavor on ACI's part the last 15 years, part of what we've gone after is scale. And the chart is up here. Now we talked about the transformational journey that we've been on. When we started this thing, I had a list of 19 companies that were in the payments business, the way payments were being done as we came into this new century, right, early 2000s. And if you were to look at most of those, you look at that '19, 10 of them are gone. The 9 that exist are 40% to 60% the size they were when it began, and that's the likes of Hewlett-Packard, and that's the likes of a lot of players in the industry. And they've done a really kind of good job of ratcheting themselves down and whatnot in terms of have they beaten their quarters. One thing that I would like to do as part of this answer is thank all of you guys who have invested in us for 12, 15 years and whatnot. And had probably allowed us to miss, what's a fair number, Craig? Craig and Scott? 50% of our quarters? Or 40%? Because we are a transformational business that's actually building future value versus one that's trying to have 90 days of consistency. And if you look at it on a 10-year basis, you'd say, gee, this is a great thing to invest in.</p><p>If you look at it in terms of saying, how do you take the lumpiness out? How do you do this? You don't in a transformational business and whatnot, and Phil Bruno, who I think is here from McKenzie's, sent me an encouraging note that 70% of transformations fail. So maybe that's why The Street doesn't look at -- we get compared to revenue growth at any price. Well, a lot of what we're doing is we're restructuring the industry. And it's not growing organic revenue that really lands up being what allows us to survive, but it's the heavy investment in integration and building a set of outcomes for the future. Look at what this management team has produced. The only thing that slows down growth at this point is the industry's adoption of a future that we know is coming. A really germane question would be, well, who are your 3 competitors that if you don't sell it, someone else is going to end up selling it? Well, in some of our categories, yes, we have competitors in bill pay, but not competitors against the front end, back end kind of a platform that we're building. Yes, we have competitors that can clip at our toes as it relates to our retail engines and whatnot, take a simplified piece out of it, whatnot. But what we've really been in -- and it's easy for me to say because I'm not defending next quarter, I'm not going to be here next quarter. When you're in a transformational business, you're trying to pour more water in, a lot more water in to this future value you're building. And you know that the past is leaking out of the bottom, so we don't have the CAGR that -- until you get critical mass. Now Dan was with me when we were at U.S. Bank, and we were building -- we were the 133rd largest Visa player in the country. When we left, we were the fourth largest owner of Visa. We missed 50% of our quarters. We took the stock from $8 to $144, right? It works, right? This works, but it's a different model than show me how this thing goes against its organic (inaudible).</p><p>These guys have the assets, and you've seen the depth of the management to make it. That's the focus I would take -- that's the focus I would take on this. How much value gets created every time you're closer and closer. We're now to the point that we have the solutions for the future. If you're a bank and it costs you $250 million to run your switching infrastructure today, if you not only renew with us but you go through the effort of converting, that $250 million system is going to cost you $100 million, right? That's $150 million. Now that's not going to come initially through a huge amount of volume increase from us. It's going to come from a 60% reduction in their unit cost to do their business, therefore, the volume or at least number of transactions that were not profitable to them before that took place, now doubles or triples or quadruples in terms of what you're doing. So what we've been doing is we've been ushering in a new era, right? And that is -- now the scale, I'm really worried about. And I'm also thrilled. We support about 150 intermediaries around the world, and they're part of this hub and spoke where it goes bank -- and I'm not talking about intermediary as a core processor, I'm talking about intermediary switches and whatnot. So today, it goes bank, intermediary, whatever the branded opportunity is, Visa, Mastercard or whatever. Do you really think that the world is going to need 150 of those 10 years from now in the cloud-based, platform-driven, right? You saw Microsoft up here, right? It's -- we're going away from hub-and-spoke because that's a hub-and-spoke, and we're going to this membrane to network global structure. And I think the volumes will be 10x higher, which is really important. And I think the amount of infrastructure required to deliver it is going to be a lot less. So yes, we're going to have a lot less players yet we have an end-to-end set of solutions that the industry has to scale up for our -- to embrace the scale that we bring to the market. Long answer, but the biggest message I wanted to give to everyone today.</p><p>Okay. Did I inhibit all future questions?</p><p>GEORGE FREDERICK SUTTON: When you look at the significant contribution that real-time payments has had to growth over the past several years, where do you think the world is in terms of moving to real-time payments? Are we still in the first or second inning?</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY: I think we're about maybe the 1% or 2% of kind of -- maybe 1% or 2%, maybe that high.</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS: Yes. I would say we are in the first innings. We're not even finished with the first inning. There's a very long and deep opportunity in the total journey. About 1/3 of the world's countries are live, so 2/3 have got to go. A lot of the banks still need to connect the whole fintech ecosystem and the whole digital transformation. That is made possible by these new real time examples albeit at the starting point. So I think there's a very long and very good cycle of activity over the next 3, 4, 5 years as the world catches up around the broader real-time opportunity. And the important thing is we've got some fantastic proof points in the marketplace about how real time, fundamentally, advantages and transforms economies. Examples like India are inspiring nations. I've been around the world and I'm hearing people say, we are getting a visit from the NPCI from India to come and explain to us what wonderful things they're doing. And so that's happening more and more and more. And so there's going to be a real buildup of activity and momentum which I think is really exciting. And to connect back to my partner conversation or answer, it's one of the reasons why our ability to build an ecosystem of people around us is so important because there's going to be more work than ACI can do. We want to get our IP out there quickly. Partners like Microsoft in the cloud and implementation partners and fintechs and what have you, I think, are an important part of accelerating the journey over the next 3 to 5 years.</p><p>GEORGE FREDERICK SUTTON: And one follow-up on the ACH market. I know ACI has a big, big backbone of ACH. And how much growth you've seen from same-day ACH and how ACI contribute to the federal reserves move to real time?</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS: You're thinking fully, right?</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY: No. No, I'm listening.</p><p>CRAIG S. SAKS: Actually, we do not process a huge amount of ACH. We originate a lot of ACH in our digital channels environment. We bring it in and reflect it back in on the other side through the digital channels. We do some through our MTS product, which looks after the wholesale payment. But that isn't a massive part of our volumes today. So in terms of questions, is real time going to disrupt another part of our franchise vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis ACH? No.</p><p>PHILIP GEORGE HEASLEY: ACH is very viable as a batch broadcast of credits like payroll. But technologically, the world's light years ahead of needing ACH as a debit mentality. Different forms of immediate, faster, whatever kind of payments you want to call them, they're going to disintermediate. They will and they should disintermediate ACH relatively in a rapid fashion, right? Again, TCH is -- the major banks in the U.S. don't want to go to a cheaper unit revenue at this point. But -- and I think the Fed will be very active in kind of forcing efficiency, at least they'll be vocal here, they'll be vocal there.</p><p>JOHN KRAFT: Any last questions?

(Operator Instructions) Just to remind you, this call is being recorded.</p><p>I'll now hand the call to Thomas Heath. Please begin your meeting.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER &amp; HEAD OF IR, SINCH AB (PUBL): Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to this Analyst and Investor Call with Sinch AB about the acquisition of ACL Mobile. My name is Thomas Heath. I'm Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Investor Relations.</p><p>With me on this call today is our CEO, Oscar Werner; and our CFO, Roshan Saldanha. With those opening remarks, I'll hand the word over to Oscar.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER, CEO, SINCH AB (PUBL): Thank you, Thomas. So we're very happy to announce the acquisition of ACL Mobile today. And in this call, we will give you a little bit of background and have questions and answers, of course.</p><p>And so if we can move to Slide 2 in the presentation, please, operator? And so this is Sinch. Many of you have seen this slide before. So revenue past 12 months of SEK 5.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of SEK 646 million, and around about 700, 800 people, present in 33 countries. We do customer engagement through mobile technology, and we do 40 billion engagements per year, and I ask you to remember that figure. That's a little bit -- it's interesting in the context of what we're doing here.</p><p>We do cloud communications squarely for messaging, delivering messages for enterprises who want to communicate to their customers. Voice services, connecting voice calls or video services to a much more extent. But if you want to do a video service to, for example, a doctor service, doctor online service or something like that. We serve 8 of the 10 largest U.S. tech companies. And this is a growing global multibillion-dollar market. That's also interesting in this context. The market is truly global. It is -- in any country that you go, you will see enterprises using these services. And also then if you have a goal to be a global player, you need to be present in the largest economies of the world, and that's one of the reasons to this being interested -- interesting. And then we have 100% consumer penetration. So pretty much any consumer with a mobile phone is a user of these type of services. As you know, I mean, we all call the ride hailing service or we all have been receiving a text message from our banks. And that's also one of the reasons here. We have global customers who would want to delivery into India, and therefore, it's interesting to expand into that market, apart from the market being interesting in itself.</p><p>All right. Operator, let's go on for the next slide, please? So Slide 3 in the presentation. So this is a -- to put it in context, the gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and the synergies of the transactions we've done. And as you can see, we have had a strong growth organically. But also, these latest transactions, they are putting us in a completely different level. And so -- both on the gross profit and the adjusted EBITDA side, it is obviously very strong to be able to make these transactions and acquiring companies that are strong, highly profitable in these times. But given the context, you can see the both Wavy, SDI and ACL, they impact on both the gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. And we believe all of those transactions will put us in a much stronger position to be a leading player globally in the CPaaS market.</p><p>Yes. Thank you. So operator, can we please go to the next slide, please? The markets in general and if we just look at Slide 4, Messaging being our core segments, we don't show Voice and Video in this segment, but Messaging alone is a $17 billion market. And it has -- and estimates vary and are actually between $15 billion and $50 billion market. We choose to take the lower end of that figure and believe in that, that is what most corresponds to our own figure of the market. But as you can see, if you just count the size there and count our revenue and the other main top competitors in this market, it's a very fragmented market. And obviously, it is a fragmented market because it's present in all countries, and that's also why if you need -- if you want to be a global player in the long run, you will need to be present in the largest economies, which this deal stands -- which this deal represents.</p><p>And then on you have on the CPaaS side -- on the Messaging side, you have the main business on SMS, which is growing at solid rates. But you also have a very high-growth part of the market, which is more on the WhatsApp, RCS, WeChat, Kakao Talk where you have the new messaging channels, which is growing very fast.</p><p>On the CPaaS side, you have a fast-growing SaaS part of the business where you add SaaS value-add on top of the actual messaging or voice or video transactions. And that part, according to all researchers, growing at a fast pace. Interesting about this transaction is India is WhatsApp and then -- I mean WhatsApp for business, and 1 of the top 3 markets, probably 1 of the top 2, if not the largest market for WhatsApp in business messages or business services. And so that's also an interesting market from an innovation perspective, and this comes both to the left and the right-hand part of this market because WhatsApp as a channel is large, but that also means that the opportunities to create value-added services on top is large. Here, you can truly see that Brazil and India is leading. And being highly present in those 2 markets will drive your innovation. So you can see the emerging markets are actually driving the innovation into the more developed world in this regard.</p><p>So operator, can we go to Slide #5, please? So this is the playbook for profitable growth that we laid out and based on 2 pillars, partly being strong in the connectivity business and then in the Software-as-a-Service business. So the connectivity business being delivering messages or terminating voice calls or terminating video calls, sorry, and Software-as-a-Service business being the software value on top. This transaction is representing us being stronger in the connectivity business, and it is truly, truly making us grow big, above all making us growing in a profitable manner. It's something that we are very proud of to be able to do. But it gives us a foundation given that India is highly in markets to go fast in the Software as a Service business.</p><p>All right. Operator, let's go to Slide 6, please? So we have set the goal to do M&amp;A in 2 categories to meet our strategic objectives. One is transactions in the scale and profitability area and the other one is in the technology and go-to-market area, so scale and profitability being the typically larger, high profitable and -- companies such as ACL. And ACL fits this squarely through scale and profitability. It's around about 300 people. It's highly profitable. It's present in the large market. It's been around for a long time. And the technology and go-to-market area is what typically buys more -- makes smaller transactions for a component of technology and the go-to markets, which we think is better to acquire than to buy, and then we acquire that, and we typically then scale those type of transactions globally. An example of this could be like myElefant or Chatlayer or those type of transactions. Larger companies are, of course, always a little bit in both, and that is true for ACL as well. But the largest and lion's shares lie -- ends up in the scale and probability category.</p><p>So operator can go to Slide 7, please? And here, you see a range of the latest acquisitions we made and how we see them fitting in the big context. As always, they're a little bit -- the larger transactions are always a little bit on both ends, but ACL primarily is in the scale and profitability category.</p><p>Operator, can we go to Slide 8, please? So ACL, it's a leading cloud communications provider in India and Southeast Asia and 1 of the top 3 players in India. It has a very strong customer base with a leading position in banking and finance. So very solid, strong customer base. We expand our customer base and diversify our revenues and our gross profit to a whole range of various very solid enterprises. It has a significant scale with 47 billion business messages handled in the past 12 months. And if I remind -- if you remember, the figure about Sinch at being 40 billion, you can see this transaction will be very large. Sinch, with all -- with the latest acquisitions, is actually doing 60 billion. So in total, it will be 110 billion messages with all the acquisitions we have made now. But as you can see, the 47 billion is very large, and that is driven by a couple of factors. Partly, it is just you can see the power of being in one of these very, very large economies, and it's just a lot of population in India, and therefore, the number of messages goes up. And also, the relative -- the number of messages or transactions in the cloud communication space per call today in India is very high compared to most other countries. And obviously, both of those factors makes it an interesting market for us to be in. And ACL has 288 employees in India, U.A.E. and Malaysia, the broadest and lion's share being in India.</p><p>Deal rationale, we think, is very straightforward here. It's a significant scale in the world's second-largest mobile market with 1.3 billion population. And we believe this is one of the markets where most of the innovation and most of the services in the mobile market and mobile industry is happening. And we believe that if you should be a global leader in this market, in telecommunications space, you need to be in the population centers of the world, and India, obviously, being one of them.</p><p>The other very important is ACL has more than 500 large enterprise customers and including the majority of India's privately-owned banks. So very strong customer base that we can add on to our own customer base and thus, diversifying on gross profit and our profits. Third one being it's a highly accretive deal, fits in the scale and profitability category. So the financial side of the deal is very solid.</p><p>And the fourth one, also very important, is that it expands our super network and gives us direct connections in India and the competitive cost structure for further expansion into Asia. And this expansion of the super network is very important to our largest customers. As you know, we are a supplier to many of the world's largest customers, and they have a strong -- very strong demand to deliver into India. And so we see it both getting a strong base in India of Indian enterprises, but also being able to offer a strong service to the world's largest customers who obviously also see India as a large and very, very important market.</p><p>So for us, this is a -- fits very well with our strategic agenda. And we did set out early in the year to say, all right, if we want to be a global player, what are the regions we want to be in, and Latin America being one of them that we wanted to enter and then India being the second. And so we can now see we're a leader in U.S., Europe, Latin America and India. And I think that makes us a truly global player, if not the most global player in this industry on a global basis.</p><p>On the integration side here, I mean, needless to say, we have been very active on the M&amp;A front. And we need to see integration. We need to take great care and be very thoughtful when we do this and give thought at great lengths about do we think that we have the capacity to make these type of transactions? And do we think we have the transaction -- capacity to integrate it? And we believe the answer to that is yes. We are, in this case, maintaining the leadership with ACL Founder and CEO, Sanjay Goyal, and joining Sinch. And we're going to run and operate this for the future as a unit. And the good things with -- when you acquire these type of larger companies, it's a company that's been around for many years. It is stable. It has stable, long-standing customers. It has a management team, and we will keep a lot of the structures intact in this deal in order to have a very strong base in India.</p><p>And as I said before, we got to use ACL's direct operator connections in India, U.A.E. and Malaysia for all our customers. And on the synergy assessment, we will get back with a more detailed estimate after the ACL and SDI transactions have closed. And the reason for that is straightforward. It is that SDI and ACL both run their operation centers out of India. And so we need to look through the combination of these 2 and then get back at a later stage with the full synergies. And we think that's prudent to do at this stage, not to overestimate the synergies we have and also not to underestimate them.</p><p>And on the financial point side, we do pay a total enterprise value of -- or maybe, Roshan, if you want to take this, if you want to take this part of the presentation, and then I'll take the next 2 slides here. But if you want to comment this and give a little bit more detail on the financial side.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA, CFO, SINCH AB (PUBL): Yes, I'm happy to step in Oscar. Thank you. Again, good morning, everybody. Very excited to announce the acquisition of ACL Mobile this morning in India. Just on the financials very quickly. Sinch is paying -- is agreeing to pay a total enterprise value of INR 5.350 billion, which equates to SEK 655 million. It should say Indian rupees there. And ACL has revenues of just under INR 5 billion during the 12 months ended March 2020. Fiscal year in India ends on March 2000 -- in March every year. They have a gross profit of INR 1.091 billion and an adjusted EBITDA of INR 480 million. These numbers correspond at current exchange rates to revenues of INR 607 million (sic) [SEK 607 million]. Gross profit of SEK 134 million and EBITDA of SEK 59 million.</p><p>Their like-for-like gross profit growth is 13% in the 12 months ending March 2020. We expect this transaction to close. The first closing coming in Q3 of 2020, where we are acquiring 82% of the company. And then we have a second closing coming more towards the end of the year after December 1, 2020, where we acquire the remaining 18%. The enterprise value and the purchase consideration will be paid in proportionate parts to the acquisition of shares.</p><p>So with that, I'll leave back to you, Oscar.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Okay. Thank you, Roshan. So we go to the next slide. Slide 9, please, operator?</p><p>So India being the second-largest mobile market in the world with a population exceeding 1.3 billion. 1.2 billion mobile subscribers and around about a 50% smartphone penetration. So here, we still have a lot of feature phones and projecting a high growth going forward on the smartphone penetration. It has the world's highest data usage per smartphone at 9.8 gigabyte per month. So here, we see a lot of innovation happening in the mobile ecosystem, and India is truly mobile-first country. And being a cloud communications company in mobile, there's nothing as important -- or there are a lot of things that are important, but it's one of the key things, it's following the innovation trends in the market, so India being a very good example there. It has a rapidly digitizing economy, second only to Indonesia in the world. If you look at the McKinsey report, you can see down in the notes, it's the world's largest WhatsApp market with over 400 million users in July 2019. So you can see it's both a very large and what we think as very important with our market. India, it's very large here in our market where we can make solid profits as of today. It is also a very, very important market to grow in the future for all of the innovation that is going on in the market, and being present in both of these aspects is very important to us.</p><p>Then going on to Slide 10, please, operator? So ACL Mobile is founded in 2000. It's a cloud communications platform for real-time communications over SMS, WhatsApp, IP messaging and voice. More than 500 enterprise customers and, as we said before, including a majority of India's privately-owned banks. 47 billion messages sent on behalf of businesses, 288 employees. And as you can see in the customer segments, they are very large and well penetrated in banking and also in insurance. And as you come down here, note a couple of things, a very, very solid and financially sound customer base. But also, there's obviously a lot of other segments as well and a lot of growth opportunities, many, many different segments in India, as you can see from this slide. If you can deliver 47 billion messages in this area, there's obviously a lot of messages in other areas as well.</p><p>Very important to say, I mean, there's also a platform here called Axiom. That is a platform for enabling banks and enterprises to handle their own communication needs. And it's a platform that they can use to -- that is offered to banks both to route traffic to ACL, but also to draw traffic to other suppliers. So they're basically both doing what we're doing, but then also enabling enterprises to handle their messaging needs and handle a set of different suppliers, which I think is good. And it's used by over 30 banks and financial institutions, meets all the needs from financial institutions in India, all the requirements, especially with electronic banking transactions. And roughly 40% of ACL's total messaging volumes comes from banks that are using Axiom as a routing engine and sending partly -- part of the traffic to ACL. It has a lot of flexible deployment options, both on-premise and cloud, and it's secure, flexible and reliable.</p><p>So operator, if you then go to Slide 11, please? So expanding the tier 1 network, being very important for our largest customers globally. So this adds direct connections to all mobile operators in India, U.A.E., Malaysia, as you see below. This is important for securing end-to-end control and then to add quality. As you can imagine, we can go to a -- large customers in the West Coast of the U.S. and say, we can control the entire chain from Silicon Valley all the way down to the operator in India. And very few, if any, other player can do that. And this is important from a quality perspective to not have to depend on middlemen. And we can ensure the quality end-to-end all the way from the globe to the carrier. And that's a very, very important feature if you want to provide a high-quality service. And high-quality can be both -- in both enhanced security, it can be speed and throughput, it can be improved redundancy or a broader feature support. But it can be all of the above basically. But typically, we have seen a very powerful way to grow with our largest customers of being able to provide those type of services.</p><p>All right. Operator, if you go to the next slide, please? And Roshan, if you can cover this slide.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Yes. Thank you, Oscar, and yes -- for taking us through why this is such a great deal for Sinch. Just commenting on the financial leverage then. As you know, Sinch has financial targets to maintain net debt over adjusted EBITDA at less than 2.5x over time. And I would stress the over time here. And as well, when we look at sort of the pro forma calculation, including the last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA for the acquired entities that we have announced and that we have closed, as at Q1 2020, reported, we had a positive cash position of 1. When including the TWW and myElefant portions, then we will come to 0.9. When including also, in addition, Chatlayer, which we closed in April, just after Q1 was closed, we would come down to a positive cash position of 0.8. If we then on a pro forma basis, also add in SDI and Wavy, which we expect to close during the second half of 2020, we would have a leverage position of 2.7. And then finally, including the adjusted EBITDA and the full consideration for the purchase of ACL, we would then end up at a leverage of 3.2. This pro forma leverage of 3.2 is within the constraints set by our bank and corporate bond covenants. We expect, of course, that since these closings are taking place during the course of the second half of 2020, we expect leverage to decline compared to these pro forma figures as EBITDA grows and cash is generated from the operations.</p><p>Operator, please turn to the next page? Page 13. This is just an overview of the integration process. And just as an overall comment, of course, we have a deal scouting process. And when we have done, sufficiently forwarding the deal scouting process. We are performing a very comprehensive due diligence covering commercial, operational, financial, tax, HR, legal and integrity areas. Post that and commercial negotiations, of course, we have signing and an announcement on a day such as this. Then until closing, usually due to regulatory restrictions, we are only allowed to plan integration. And then, of course, after closing of the transactions, the actual integration work begins.</p><p>When it comes to sort of the integration work that we are doing, if you look to the already closed transactions such as TWW and myElefant, which were announced during October 2019; and Chatlayer, which was closed in April 2020, we are progressing as per plan. In the case of TWW, we have the platform integration ongoing. And in myElefant, we are targeting a U.S. launch this year. And in Chatlayer -- in the case of Chatlayer, we are performing deeper integration.</p><p>When it comes to the transactions that we have announced but not yet closed, Wavy; SAP Digital Interconnect, or SDI; and from today then, ACL, we have regulatory process is ongoing in the case of Wavy and SDI as well as integration planning together with the management for those companies as applicable under regulatory rules and conditions.</p><p>In the case of ACL, we will be performing further synergy assessments as well because we see benefits of having ACL and also that SDI has a significant presence -- has some presence in India then.</p><p>Turning to the next page, Page 14, just to remind you of sort of the message volumes. And Oscar mentioned earlier that combining all of the transaction volumes that we have, including the signed but not yet closed transactions, on a last 12-month basis, we would have more than 110 billion transactions. The acquisitions of TWW and myElefant, of course, last year in October added significant volumes where you see an increase there in the end of 2019. In the beginning of 2020, or specifically in March 2020, we had a onetime spike, as we commented on in our Q1 report commentary. And we had seen already in April, as we said at that time that, that spike has started to -- had gone away and the traffic volumes have started to normalize. I think we just want to reiterate that message, that the spike was a onetime spike in the end of March 2020.</p><p>We have growth from existing customers, of course, new customers and new use cases, and that continues. So our normalized growth trend continues, but that spike is -- was a onetime event. In addition, I think just to reiterate what we said in the Q1 report, our Voice and Video segment, where we have a significant amount of traffic coming from the ride-hailing business, has been affected by lockdown restrictions and we have seen volumes drop in Q1. That was a couple of weeks. But during the second quarter, of course, it is affecting the entire quarter, at least until now. And then finally, when it comes to Messaging volumes, as we said again in the Q1 report, we have seen some segments being negatively affected, whereas other segments then increasing and compensating for that negative impact. So again, messaging volumes continued to trend more in line with normal behavior, excluding the spike in Q1.</p><p>Finally, turning to the next page, please, operator? Page 15, our financial targets. Adjusted EBITDA, which our adjusted EBITDA per share to grow at 20% per year, and net debt to remain at less than 2.5x adjusted EBITDA over time. We grew adjusted EBITDA per share at 52% measured on a rolling 12-month basis. And net debt, we had a positive cash position of 1 at the end of Q1. And as I said, pro forma net debt would be at 3.2x with the acquisitions of Wavy, SAP -- SDI and ACL.</p><p>With that, I would like to hand back over to you, Oscar, for any concluding remarks.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Thank you, Roshan. So the concluding remarks here from me is India being one of the largest markets in the world, the most innovative mobile markets, is very key to be in, both from a local perspective but also from being able to serve -- successfully serve the largest brands on the planet. That is very clear on the strategic intent of what we're doing here and the need. And we think it's very, very strong that we can now say that we're one of the leaders in U.S., Europe, Latin America and India. That makes us truly global, which is very important in this market. So that's number one.</p><p>So I think the strategic rationale for making this transaction is, to us, very strong and very straightforward. And then the other part which I'm sure you all think about, all right, so is it right to do it now? And then, can we handle the integration? And then the answer to that is, one, you cannot always choose the timing of M&amp;A transactions. As you know, you have to -- sometimes have to choose when we do it and then -- or do you not to do it at all? And we think this is one of the best markets to be in and the most high-quality supplier network player in this market, and therefore, we think the transaction is good.</p><p>And -- but obviously, then on the integration front, we are -- we had analyzed that program in a very good manner. And we do think we have the capacity to do it. But if you also note that is a stable long-term company that has operated on itself for a long time. And therefore, we can -- it's not like we needed to do anything immediately. This is a stable company that will continue -- that has been running for a long time and will continue. And also, a very important point here is where -- these companies, we know for a long time. It is not something -- it's not like we're super new to this market or to the Indian market. We have used almost all the suppliers in India for a long time, and we have evaluated over many years of sending traffic via them. So we know the people, we know the good players, and we know what's happening in there since we, obviously, have traffic as of today. So therefore, many of these companies that we acquired is known entities to us. And it's people that we know, and it's companies that we know. That obviously takes down the risk of these type of transactions a lot. And so that's very important to understand. It's almost like 20 years of experience in a market that we're playing out in a short period of time here to say, all right. We know all these players. We've taken all our experience and then extending it out to making a set of acquisitions in a rapid pace -- in rapid pace in order to get where we want to. And this has a long, long background.</p><p>With that said, I want to leave over to Thomas and then for Q&amp;A.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: Thank you, Oscar, and operator, are there any questions on the line?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Djurberg of Handelsbanken.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations on another interesting acquisition. For sure, it keep us analysts quite busy, which is positive. My question would be, first, on the -- if you can comment a little bit on the growth trends in gross profit? You said to be 13% rolling 12 months? Is this trending upward or flattish? Or is it in line with the market? And is it big differences between ACL Mobile versus the Axiom platform?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Roshan can take that.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Yes, I can take the growth trend. Thanks, Daniel. When it comes to the growth outlook, I think it's -- I think the short-term growth outlook in the case of ACL, there is a current pandemic ongoing in the world. And India, of course, has had quite significant lockdown restrictions here beginning in March, and I think the whole month of April and the whole month of May and only partly lifted at least now in June. So I think that's important to remember. How that develops during the coming weeks and months will affect the short-term growth outlook. When it comes to the long-term growth outlook for the Indian market as a whole and for ACL, we are quite positive to that. And we aim, of course, to improve that, I think, for ACL as well compared to historical performance. I think there are several reasons to do that. I mean one is, of course, the combination of Sinch and ACL, combining our strong global product and global presence of customers as well as the local strength of ACL in India as well as sort of our -- how we can leverage on that position in our emerging market strategy, I think, just to point to what the reasons, I think, Oscar went into more detail in his presentation and comments. But we are quite positive that, that long-term growth outlook is higher than the number historically.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: Okay. And another question, if I may, would be also on Axiom. Do you -- is it already cloud-enabled? Or do you see a need to work on R&amp;D to cloudify this to get good enough cost and revenue leverage? And also, if you consider it a positive thing or a risk that it is generating some 40% of the total ACL messaging volumes on the total.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: So this is Oscar, I can take that. No, we see that's an opportunity, definitely not as a risk. And we see this very strong point to both favor the supplier in what we do, but also enabling enterprises and especially banks to handle the messaging needs. I think it's a strong point and is an opportunity, not as a risk, and -- because you're basically doing an additional service to them. And it is cloud-enabled, it's of high scale. And you need to -- this is one of the very interesting dynamics for this type of transaction is, this company is handling 47 billion messages at a fraction of the cost that we are handling our 40 billion messages only. So is it scalable, is it cloud-enabled, and all of those questions are yes. But it's also giving us a low-cost base. We cannot -- in Sinch, we're not as cost-efficient in handling the messages as ACL, we're far from it. And we think this, I mean, giving Sinch this very strong ability to have the high -- very high volume of messages to a low cost, it's been very important going forward. As in any highly competitive market, that is important. So the answer is yes to the questions, but we also see that as a very strong strategic advantage going forward.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: Perfect. And my final sort of question would be, is there any news on the regulatory approval of SDI and Wavy as of yet?</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: I can take it if you like, yes?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes.</p><p>ROSHAN SALDANHA: Yes. Daniel, I mean, we are -- of course, I mean both Wavy and SDI involve a number of closing conditions, among other things, a carve-out as well as regulatory approval in a number of different markets. At this point in time, the only thing we can say is that we are progressing in those processes, and we have close dialogue with the different regulators involved. I mean there's no other update to give other than that we are still confident that we will close this in the second half of 2020, as we have previously announced.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Predrag Savinovic of Carnegie.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC, RESEARCH ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of follow-ups. And I think one obviously is, of course, the integration backlog here. And I think your comment was very good there, Oscar. But if you can maybe talk briefly on how these processes differ from one another? I mean I can assume that there's quite a big difference between integrating SDI and ACL. And to me, ACL seems more similar maybe to TWW in terms of integration process.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: You are correct. Well spotted. ACL and TWW are similar in one sense and that it's kind of straightforward messaging companies. SAP has a set of other units as well. So they're more similar. Then the big difference, obviously, ACL being bigger, but also the low-cost nature and very high-volume nature of ACL is different. It's -- TWW is there as well, but it takes it to a different level. But that's true. But if you look at this, if you look at the ones we've done, I mean, the myElefant and Chatlayer are squarely in one category there. We're making them own one piece of the global components. We have myElefant and Chatlayer, their tech teams, they're also -- you own this component globally. I mean cloud, that's possible to do, right? We just connect it. We just upload it on to Amazon, and they connect -- we connect to different units. But R&amp;D-wise, they are in one unit.</p><p>And we're doing that integration and making sure the lines and the interfaces that we have on our R&amp;D teams are clear, and then they can only go over the component or they can increase the space there. And we see that going forward on a very positive note. And I mean right now they're putting together myElefant and the Vehicle team into -- so we're really seeing that going forward. The transactions we do on TWW side, it's ongoing and we're deploying our messaging platform down in Brazil and Latin America. And we see that ongoing in a positive manner with a very positive collaboration with TWW. So we see those 3 are kind of underway. We also see both, although I understand, TWW and Chatlayer side, we have great demands from our existing teams and a lot of cross-sells. So actually, a lot of our deals in Europe are now containing myElefant technology. So a large portion of the Axiom side customers are containing these components ordered in days. We see -- we're seeing also on the revenue front.</p><p>On the Wavy, SAP and [ACL], I mean, obviously, we can do integration planning. We have to work on integration execution after the deal closes. But we see the planning ongoing with both SAP on an earlier stage and Wavy as well. I mean we're laying out the plans, and we'll see how this is going to fit in. It's very -- seeing these [kits] come in and then you can see, you can do the integration and then how much you can actually release some forward-looking R&amp;D and forward-looking services and forward-looking sales, I mean it becomes very, very powerful when -- in the middle and seeing the opportunity here. You can see the power of actually doing this and coming out at the other end of the integration. So I'm generally very positive.</p><p>But actually, I should say, it's -- the positive thing -- obviously, it's a lot of work, but the positive things of doing a number of transactions like this is you can really start to plan for it. We know we're going to have a lot of integration work in the coming couple of years here. And that makes it possible for us to plan for and have a professional team really focusing on it. If you do it once, it's inclusive. It's almost harder because you cannot plan for it, you can't have resources. But here, we -- there's so much synergies, there's a lot of opportunity. We can actually plan for it in the long term, and we can resource it, which, in one way, it's harder, of course, but in one way, it's almost easier. And like anything you do effectively again, obviously, becomes -- you can create the integration machine in a much better way. All right?</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: All right. That's very encouraging. In terms of synergies here, you're not targeting any synergies? I know ACL seems to run quite effectively based on the margins. So I assume that most synergies here will come from the revenue side in the future. And you did mention now some forward-looking R&amp;D. But is it safe to assume that there should be some revenue synergies here? And maybe also, what degree of your customers have traffic needs in India if we can compare these a bit.</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: So revenue synergies definitely. We typically don't state those, as you know. But definitely, I mean, we see them in TWW. We see them in myElefant, and we see them in Chatlayer. And I would say, of our largest customers, the big tech customers, I would say, 100% have needs in India. I mean there's not a global brand with no customers in India, particularly on global. So on that side, yes, there's definitely opportunities. Then it's on routing. Obviously, you've seen the routes in ACL, and they have a lower cost base in India than we do. So our existing traffic, we can port over and get it more cost-efficient than we can today, and therefore, you have synergies on that front.</p><p>And then on the cost side, you're correct. I mean when you go into here and you have a very low cost base, you need to be a little bit careful about the synergies on the OpEx side and also because both ACL and SDI have opportunities there. So you're correct, a large portion being there, and we're -- to be conservative, we don't state too much on the OpEx side due to these couple of factors before we had got pretty closer to the deal. And in the long run, we see ACL as a platform for having a lower -- a lower cost base where -- which we think is very powerful and also very strategic. So if you take it, played it a bit longer, we do think that it's very powerful and make it as more competitive in general, which we can, obviously, see as synergies and something else. But we see that, and we think that will have a large impact on us going forward.</p><p>PREDRAG SAVINOVIC: All right. Super. And just one final follow-up there. You did mention the U.S. big tech. And I think you mentioned before that having access to Latin America and India is very important to your current customers. You see very strong demand for delivery in India. And at the same time, your customers like the U.S. big tech guys, they've been driving organic growth in the past quarters. You also mentioned that there's significant runway left for these customers with regards to traffic. So I'm trying just to understand the hurdles here that they see? Could this enable the likes of Microsoft, Salesforce, et cetera, to really allocate more traffic to Sinch now?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes. I mean that's -- I mean I can't say what they're going to do. But that's our goal, of course, yes. I think all these companies have significant traffic into India. I mean it's not a surprise, this is a big market, right? So all of these customers are global. They have significant traffic into India. They typically don't send it via Sinch today, and some do. But a lot of them don't because they may have local relations with companies such as ACL or others because it's just such a big market, right? This is a large portion of the world population, and they can do that. They wouldn't do that for Colombia. They don't even do that for Brazil. But for India or China or -- they may do that because it's so large companies -- or so large countries.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we have one further question in the queue so far. That's from the line of Ramil Koria of SEB.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA, ANALYST, SEB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a few questions from my side. Oscar, just to come back to your question on the cost efficiency. I mean 47 billion transactions, but to be the devil's advocate here, it's around about low teens of your revenues on similar transaction volumes. Is there any monetization issues here? Or is it simply so that you have more higher-value termination versus ACL?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Sorry, I didn't really understand the question.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: So they have 47 billion transactions. You have 60 billion, you said, something like that? But let's take LTM numbers, you have 40 billion, and ACL posted 11%, 12% of your revenues on higher transaction volumes. So whilst more cost efficient, sure, but revenue per transaction seems way lower. Is there any sort of reason behind that? Or am I simply missing anything there?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: It's a very good question. It is -- India is a very high-volume, low-revenue and gross profit transaction market. That is the market structure in India. That is also -- so that's just how it is. And that is driven by -- there is a lot of regulations that drives a lot of the [ignored] financial institutions to have to use text messaging and forward for a lot of different use cases. So there's just a very, very high amount of transactions. And there is even a lower cost per transaction, which both comes from the operator prices to enterprises or to people like us is low, and therefore, it drives a lot of transactions. But it's also so that, obviously, the huge populations and the economy in India makes the margin per message lower. So that's true.</p><p>On the other hand, you can see that you can run a lot of companies in a profitable way. I mean if you look at the total metrics on them, I mean, their profitability is very similar to any other company that you would see in the text message space, us or Wavy or SDI or anything else. It's just like higher number of transactions to a lower cost per -- to a lower gross profit per transaction. That's true. And that's also why we think it's for us to enter this type of a low-cost market directly ourselves is very hard because as a western company, you may have the wrong cost base. On the other hand, have that cost play, and be able to play them back into our core markets, it's obviously a very large opportunity and also a way to secure that you don't get low-cost competition that you cannot meet. So that's how I would see that. But you're correct, if you look at gross profit per message, it's very low. On the other hand, their profitability in terms of gross profit or EBITDA on total is very similar to any other market. But we see that as an opportunity because it enables us to run that type of business model and not the other way around.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: So very clear. And then just pretty high level on the deal here. What does it really mean that it's run as a unit? And how does that differ from how you go about in other markets? And then perhaps as a follow-up to that. You've mentioned several times during the day here that this is a platform business. Should we read it that this is a way to enter other Asian markets greenfield using the superior cost structure that ACL has?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: Yes. I think your 2 questions are connected in a way. So -- and it's good questions. It is yes. Due to the very low-cost structure here, we obviously don't want that -- we want to utilize that. And therefore, we want to kind of run it as a unit and run it -- it's not separate or standalone. But in many other transactions, we just -- we are just taking our core process that will be refined in a bit different areas and we're just implementing them and then unifying it all to 1 platform, 1 organization, 1 operations, et cetera. Here, we need to look much, much closer since it's actually a lower-cost transaction than we have, which we see as an opportunity. And here, we need to then look much, much closer. And therefore, we want to make sure we keep that low-cost base and their program as a unit and take the integration in the longer term. And the -- your other part of the question, it is correct. We do see this as an opportunity to do a organic entry into markets, which we typically before didn't have access to because it's a lower-cost base. And we see that as a very strong thing with the transactions going forward.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: It's very clear. I have 2 more questions, hope that's fine. But on -- first off, on the due diligence here. I mean you mentioned that you've been in contact with the company through aggregation, et cetera, previously. And you've had the chance to sort of interact with competitors as well. But from conversation starting to deal closing, how has the due diligence actually been made given sort of the current situation we're in now? Have you been able to meet the company? And how thorough can you be remotely?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: We have met this company sometimes. This process started long before COVID. And there's 2 parts in the process. One is the fact, all right, we have in India for a long time. We've been meeting the company for years. And that's obviously before COVID. So that's one part. But if you just take the proper due diligence process, it started before COVID. So several people from Sinch have been down in India and met this company several times. So yes, we have met them. Obviously, the latter part here, we have had to do remotely for many reasons. But yes, we've met the company sometimes. And we should also mention that both Roshan and Vikram are born in India. So to us, it's also closer so we've been able to -- both our CFO and CPO having -- being born in India, obviously, has made it easier for us to assess the India market as such with 2 management team members already being born in that country.</p><p>RAMIL KORIA: That's very clear. And a final one from my side here. Just looking at the purchase price, 11x EBITDA trailing. You paid 15x pre-synergies for the SAP unit. Looking at the trend since your IPO a few years ago, seems to be sloping upwards somewhat. So I mean is that sustainably on these levels bearing in mind it's a regional player, et cetera, but stripping that out? I mean have multiples, generally speaking, come up? Or is this a one-off platform transaction?</p><p>OSCAR WERNER: It's obviously hard to say, but I think this market has been, in general, have up valued a lot. And then you can see that in our own share price, I think the comparative numbers are obviously -- I don't think the comparative numbers are trending up, not the actual numbers if you only look at this, it's obviously going up. And so generally, the market has been up valued, but I think that, that maybe goes for all assets. On the other hand, it is not to say -- when you look at a multiple individually, it is very hard to say because it's -- there's so many things that goes into that, so many things that goes into that number specifically. But I think when I look at it, that all of these transactions are very highly accretive to us in any way, shape or form. And that's why we think they're very financially sound to make. And then we obviously evaluate each individual transaction on a stand-alone basis.</p><p>OPERATOR: And as there are no further questions in the queue at this time, I'll hand back to our speakers for the closing comments.</p><p>THOMAS HEATH: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

This move comes on the back of a number of similar initiatives over the years.    At a virtual conference on September 15, 2020, the company announced a number of initiatives that could help business owners address the need for funding and training across various sectors.    Among these are plans to help 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses get online. There\u2019s also a partnership with Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Youth and Sports to provide support for 500,000 youth-owned businesses.    About $3 million has been earmarked for vulnerable populations in different parts of Africa, and to support nonprofits actively engaged in the fight to help various communities and businesses recover from the effects of the pandemic.        These initiatives represent Google\u2019s latest moves to deepen its digital presence in Africa. Looking back, it seemed to really kick things into high gear in 2016 when it launched its digital skills initiative to train people in the use of various digital skills. It also kicked off its Launchpad Accelerator , a program that provides six months of equity-free support for startups.    In 2016, it reportedly entered a pact with South African company, Onyx, to help with the local manufacture of smartphones. By 2017, it had reportedly provided financial support for tech hubs in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda.    In 2018, it launched the Google Station, a free wifi program that has since shut down in Lagos , and looks set to be discontinued . Earlier in 2020, it also announced emergency relief funds for critically affected newsrooms across the globe.    Besides Google, other big tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft have also been engaging in one form of business or social investment in Africa.    The next phase for Google seems to be SMBs or SMEs, a key part of Africa\u2019s economy.   Google\u2019s play for SMEs      The International Finance Corporation (IFC) posits that SMEs account for 90% of all businesses in Africa . However, a large percentage of these businesses are unregistered and have little access to credit facilities among other benefits.    In Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets, PwC states that SMEs account for 96% of all businesses , and about 84% of the workforce.         Several of these businesses were badly hit following the onset of the pandemic, and just a few have been able to adapt.    According to Ehimuan, many of these businesses have had to quickly figure out how to pivot their operations to a digital-first approach. Yet, a gap remains between those who can access these online opportunities and those who can\u2019t.    \u201cIf the economy of Africa is to recover quickly from the challenges of the period, they (SMEs) must be supported. It\u2019s a responsibility for all because an Africa that works is great for everyone, including Google,\u201d she asserts.    Despite the fact that most SMEs are unregistered, Google says it is opening the initiatives to all small businesses that are not online.   Why these moves?      Historically, companies engaged in some form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to boost the productivity of workers, and according to multinational consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the concept of businesses giving back to their community and environment has evolved over time.    According to a 2015 piece in the Harvard Business Review , though businesses are meant to engage in CSR to give back to the community and the environment, it has since become a business discipline that demands business results.    So which is it for Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies with various investments in Africa? Giving back to the community, or a business strategy? A look at Internet stats in Africa offers some perspective.    According to Internet world stats\u2019 2019 report, with a penetration rate of 39%, Africa had about 528 million Internet users, pointing to an estimated 814 million people that do not have access to the Internet.    Given the relatively low purchasing power, economic struggles, and a dearth of infrastructure (power and Internet), these figures for Africa\u2019s Internet population could also be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism.    For big tech companies like Google and Facebook, Africa seems to be a big unexplored market with millions of people still connected to the Internet.    Consequently, these companies have engaged in deepening Internet infrastructure and investing in technology companies, among others.    Juliet Ehimuan, Google Country Manager, Nigeria, believes that Google\u2019s various initiatives, especially during the pandemic, are expressive of the company\u2019s commitment to helping individuals and businesses in Africa thrive again.    \u201cIt is in all our interest that African economies rebound and recover,\u201d she says.   Getting businesses online      Ehimuan says that Google will offer SMEs various online tools such as market finder among others, but the bigger issue has always been Internet access. A lot of work is still needed to deepen the Internet and power infrastructure.    Though Google worked on Project Loon with the creation of Balloons beaming 4G signals in some parts of Kenya, they did not disclose any further expansion plans to other parts of Africa.    For now, it appears Google will join Facebook to increase Africa\u2019s subsea Internet cable capacity. The cable, Equiano, which was announced in 2019, will connect Portugal to South Africa and will have its first branching point in Nigeria.    This will, however, be rendered ineffective, if the Internet capacity at Africa\u2019s coast does not translate to better terrestrial Internet infrastructure. By Q4 2021, Equiano will add at least 100 Tbps to an existing capacity of ~170 Tbps, but only an average of 10 Tbps leaves the coast to the places where they are needed.    For these cables to be effective, more investments have to be made in deepening Internet infrastructure in various structure. But then, this might mean more regulatory involvement, as well as facing the official and unofficial bottlenecks that hinder African telcos from deepening Internet infrastructure.    Facebook found a way by forming strategic partnerships with the likes of MainOne and Orange, while Google\u2019s Project Loon has found relative success in Kenya.    In many ways, the activities of Big Tech companies have changed the world, but it appears a lot more changes are still to be seen in Africa.     NEW EPISODE OUT!

In order to do that, we have partnered with some of the most amazing solution providers in the region. We spoke to Sanjay Jha, Co-founder and CTO of LetsVenture, India's most active startup fundraising platform and the Chief Product Officer (CPO) of MyStartupEquity, to get a closer look at their products and services and to help the community understand better how MyStartupEquity can help them yield desirable results.Can you describe what your company does? What industry you are in, who your target market is?</p><p>For the last 7 years, Letsventure has been the most trusted and active platform for startup fundraising in India. We have a strong track record in building out a tech-enabled platform that has enabled over 250 startups to raise more than $200 M from thousands of angel investors, micro-VC funds and family offices. Having raised this equity, we have also noticed the gap in the market to manage this equity and that was the genesis of MyStartupEquity in late 2019. MyStartupEquity is a SaaS fintech play that is digitising, automating and securing the most valuable asset that any startup has \u2014 its own equity! This is a product to help founders, employees, investors and VCs better manage their equity in startups. What do we mean by this? Also read: A closer look at Zendesk: fostering better customer relationships for startups everywhere[1] Well, the product is designed to become the single source of truth for all matters related to a startup's cap table and ESOPs (including Phantom Stocks, Stock Appreciation Rights). By using the product, startups, right from the earliest stages to those with 10s of investors and 100s of employees with ESOPs can avoid errors that might creep into an Excel sheet and the lack of security when this Excel sheet floats into the market. Moreover, the product has a lot of tools packed in to make the life for the founder, finance and HR teams simple. Presently, MyStartupEquity has 60 startups (seed to Series D) from India, USA and Singapore using the cap table and ESOP management product.How does your product/service help companies? What gaps in the market do your products bridge?Today, the biggest problem is the information asymmetry and lack of security in the way cap tables and ESOPs are managed. Founders have a lot on their plate, finance and HR team members may change, an outsourced firm might not prioritise tasks; and all this leads to delays and errors \u2014 both forced and unforced. Let's take an example: Mark is the founder of a startup that has raised a seed round of $500,000 from friends and family and two angel investors (his ex-bosses at the big tech company he was working at before). With this, he brought on board his co-founder and CTO, Eileen and the early product team, marketing and sales team \u2014 all of whom he promised generous ESOPs since he couldn't meet market salaries. For his product and marketing team, Mark chose to have standard quarterly vesting after the one-year cliff period but for the sales team, he chose performance-based vesting. He's managing all this on an Excel sheet. Fast forward two years, the startup is doing well \u2014 over 10 employees now have ESOPs and Mark has raised a small round of convertible debt too. Now, he is in the market to raise a Series A of $1.5 M. VCs and some large individual angels want to see the cap table and also get a sense of what the fully diluted cap table will look like if they were to invest. Mark also has to be cognisant of the part conversion of the debt round and topping up of the ESOP pool as part of the Series A. He also has to allocate a higher share to Eileen as he had promised her when she came on board two years ago. Also read: 5 actions to consider for your startup as the economy reopens[2] Now, all of these calculations and managing expectations of current and prospective investors are daunting for Mark, he's running multiple Excel sheets and having to cross-check every new round modelling scenario with his chartered accountant. This is taking up time and bandwidth. Meanwhile, new team members are being on-boarded and as the founder, Mark has to run and manage the ESOP conversations with them too. Sounds difficult and strenuous? Well, it is, but it is also the reality of startup and founder life! This is where MyStartupEquity comes in with its easy to use interface and click of button calculators, report generators and in-product communication tools. For instance, the Cap Table Tool helps founders maintain a single source of truth and safe keep share certificates and various other documents online. Information from multiple rounds including bridge rounds are maintained online and tools and notifiers for convertible debt instruments like SAFE, Convertible Notes, ensures that no investor and round information is missed out due to unforced errors. Moreover, MyStartupEquity's scenario modelling tool can help Mark run various calculations on what his new cap table would look like and he can securely share the same with his investors on a need to know basis \u2014 all of this from within the product itself. No need to worry about conflict of interests and unsolicited entities becoming privy to sensitive information. Also read: Pivoting beyond product: You need to look at your company/work culture, too[3] On the ESOP front, at the earliest stages, the MyStartupEquity product would have allowed Mark to create and customise his ESOP policy online and get a simple dashboard view of the ESOP pool. He would have been able to manage the granting, vesting and exercising of options digitally for all team members too. Additionally, the product generates all the accounting and book-keeping required for ESOPs and Mark or his CA can use these reports to make all the regulatory filings required; literally at a click of a button. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the products' employee interface allows everyone on Mark's team to actually see the value of their ESOPs and continue to be energised about the road ahead for the startup. To summarise, these are the top features of the product that makes life easier for founders, employees and investors:\u2022 Digital cap table with features for round &amp;#38; exit modelling\u2022 Calculator &amp;#38; notifier to manage convertible instruments\u2022 Secure document vault\u2022 Customised ESOP scheme generator\u2022 Manage grants, vesting, exercise, &amp;#38; employee exits online\u2022 Automated accounting, reporting, &amp;#38; annual filings\u2022 Role based permissions for users\u2022 Multi Factor AuthenticationCan you give an example of how your product is being used by your customers? Any customer success stories you'd like to share?Presently MyStartupEquity has 60 startups from India, USA and Singapore using the cap table and ESOP management product. Some of these startups include Zetwerk (funded by Sequoia, Lightspeed), Jupiter Money (funded by Sequoia, Matrix), Cyware (Emerald Development Managers), Darwinbox (Sequoia funded), Epifi (Sequoia, Ribbit Capital), Kyt.academy. Also read: How Pomelo tackles the problem of high product return with its O2O retail experience[4] 'Zetwerk is a 2-year old startup and we just closed our Series C. Right from the time we closed our Series B, I had been thinking about moving into a product that would help us manage the cap table and the administration of the ESOPs because there were times when our data did not match \u2014 when something like that happens to a process like ESOPs which has financial liability both for the employee and the employer, it is of great concern. We scanned various products and then decided to go ahead with MyStartupEquity because of the capability and competence of the team. Secondly, I wanted the product to have a simple and easy user interface while getting things done smoothly &amp;#38; accurately. Lastly, the price point was very compelling and that helped us make a faster decision,' Barat Vinayakan, CHRO, Zetwerk (a manufacturing services startup with 300+ employees, 100+ customers across 30+ countries) Are there any recent accomplishments of your company that you want to share with the e27 Community?Sequoia Surge, Freshworks for Startups, and of course, e27 are some of the partners that have endorsed MyStartupEquity and extended the product to their startups across India and APAC.

Founders have a lot on their plate, finance and HR team members may change, an outsourced firm might not prioritise tasks; and all this leads to delays and errors \u2014 both forced and unforced.    Let\u2019s take an example: Mark is the founder of a startup that has raised a seed round of $500,000 from friends and family and two angel investors (his ex-bosses at the big tech company he was working at before). With this, he brought on board his co-founder and CTO, Eileen and the early product team, marketing and sales team \u2014 all of whom he promised generous ESOPs since he couldn\u2019t meet market salaries. For his product and marketing team, Mark chose to have standard quarterly vesting after the one-year cliff period but for the sales team, he chose performance-based vesting. He\u2019s managing all this on an Excel sheet.    Fast forward two years, the startup is doing well \u2014 over 10 employees now have ESOPs and Mark has raised a small round of convertible debt too. Now, he is in the market to raise a Series A of $1.5 M. VCs and some large individual angels want to see the cap table and also get a sense of what the fully diluted cap table will look like if they were to invest. Mark also has to be cognisant of the part conversion of the debt round and topping up of the ESOP pool as part of the Series A. He also has to allocate a higher share to Eileen as he had promised her when she came on board two years ago.

This is taking up time and bandwidth. Meanwhile, new team members are being on-boarded and as the founder, Mark has to run and manage the ESOP conversations with them too.    Sounds difficult and strenuous? Well, it is, but it is also the reality of startup and founder life!    This is where MyStartupEquity comes in with its easy to use interface and click of button calculators, report generators and in-product communication tools.    For instance, the Cap Table Tool helps founders maintain a single source of truth and safe keep share certificates and various other documents online. Information from multiple rounds including bridge rounds are maintained online and tools and notifiers for convertible debt instruments like SAFE, Convertible Notes, ensures that no investor and round information is missed out due to unforced errors. Moreover, MyStartupEquity\u2019s scenario modelling tool can help Mark run various calculations on what his new cap table would look like and he can securely share the same with his investors on a need to know basis \u2014 all of this from within the product itself. No need to worry about conflict of interests and unsolicited entities becoming privy to sensitive information.    Also read:  Pivoting beyond product: You need to look at your company/work culture, too    On the ESOP front, at the earliest stages, the MyStartupEquity product would have allowed Mark to create and customise his ESOP policy online and get a simple dashboard view of the ESOP pool. He would have been able to manage the granting, vesting and exercising of options digitally for all team members too. Additionally, the product generates all the accounting and book-keeping required for ESOPs and Mark or his CA can use these reports to make all the regulatory filings required; literally at a click of a button.    Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the products\u2019 employee interface allows everyone on Mark\u2019s team to actually see the value of their ESOPs and continue to be energised about the road ahead for the startup.    To summarise, these are the top features of the product that makes life easier for founders, employees and investors:     \u2022 Digital cap table with features for round &amp; exit modelling  \u2022 Calculator &amp; notifier to manage convertible instruments  \u2022 Secure document vault  \u2022 Customised ESOP scheme generator  \u2022 Manage grants, vesting, exercise, &amp; employee exits online  \u2022 Automated accounting, reporting, &amp; annual filings  \u2022 Role based permissions for users  \u2022 Multi Factor Authentication   Can you give an example of how your product is being used by your customers? Any customer success stories you\u2019d like to share?   Presently MyStartupEquity has 60 startups from India, USA and Singapore using the cap table and ESOP management product. Some of these startups include Zetwerk (funded by Sequoia, Lightspeed), Jupiter Money (funded by Sequoia, Matrix), Cyware (Emerald Development Managers), Darwinbox (Sequoia funded), Epifi (Sequoia, Ribbit Capital), Kyt.academy.

Right from the time we closed our Series B, I had been thinking about moving into a product that would help us manage the cap table and the administration of the ESOPs because there were times when our data did not match \u2014 when something like that happens to a process like ESOPs which has financial liability both for the employee and the employer, it is of great concern. We scanned various products and then decided to go ahead with MyStartupEquity because of the capability and competence of the team. Secondly, I wanted the product to have a simple and easy user interface while getting things done smoothly &amp; accurately. Lastly, the price point was very compelling and that helped us make a faster decision,\u201d Barat Vinayakan, CHRO, Zetwerk (a manufacturing services startup with 300+ employees, 100+ customers across 30+ countries)      Are there any recent accomplishments of your company that you want to share with the e27 Community?

It takes a while to appreciate he is furious, granted, because he is a ponderous writer, and in World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech he is apt to get distracted from his fury with lengthy passages about things such as the history of bookshelves, or whether Des-cartes really built a robot that looked like his dead daughter, Francine, which was thrown off a boat. (No.) But furious he definitely is. As the subtitle suggests, he believes that tech companies are ruining the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Oh, that again,\" you might think. Foer, though, is well placed to make this criticism, because before tech companies started ruining the world, they first ruined his. Foer resigned/was fired in 2014 as editor of The New Republic, one of those liberal New York magazines that people pretend to read. The magazine's new proprietor, Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook, had bought an old media company and was set upon turning it into a new media company. Foer, who oozes old media despite not really being old enough, was far from keen on this.</p><p>Foer believes that tech companies have degraded the intellectual discourse of not just social media users, but civilisation. They have, he argues, assaulted the very foundation of knowledge. For Foer, the foundational text of Silicon Valley was The Whole Earth Catalog, a countercultural magazine run by Stewart Brand in the late 1960s, which sought to spread niche knowledge to the hippy masses. Brand came up with the maxim \"information wants to be free\". Foer puts this as the inspiration behind Google's desire to scan every book in existence, waging war on the concept of copyright. The idea is that maximum human knowledge should lead to maximum human enlightenment.</p><p>Yet that's not what happened. For one thing, when you have endless available information you hit what David Foster Wallace called \"total noise\", an impenetrable blurt of everything. The historical problem of scarcity of information - which early tech evangelists sought to solve - has morphed into a scarcity of attention.</p><p>People need to filter. The tech answer is an algorithm, but algorithms are not neutral. Foer points out that Netflix and Amazon offer recommendations to their users, but there the similarities end. Amazon directs its users to more familiar products (one third of its purchases come from its recommendations), whereas subscriptionbased Netflix directs users to the unfamiliar because blockbusters cost more to stream.</p><p>Foer has a slightly tweedy disdain for the philistines of tech. You can feel the sneer in his quoting of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, when he complains about physical books, \"turning the pages \u2026 the book is always flopping itself shut at the wrong moment\".</p><p>Coming from a man whose firm sells 40 per cent of all books bought, this hurts.</p><p>Even so, Foer's denunciation of online journalism, which comes in his book's best chapter, is powerful. He notes that a memoir by the critic Alfred Kazin recalls that the fee for a book review in The New Republic of the 1930s was $150. Despite 80 years of inflation, this is also, dollar for dollar, the fee for a book review for the same magazine's website. Everything is falling apart.</p><p>\"The core insight of Upworthy, Buzzfeed, Vox and other emerging internet behemoths,\" he writes, \"was that editorial success could be engineered.\" A company can study which topics get the most clicks, and which writers. This has led to the phenomenon of headlines with a \"curiosity gap\". Upworthy once garnered 6 million clicks from the headline \"9 Out Of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact\". The fact in question was merely a dry statistic about income inequality. At the time, the company would create 25 headlines per story, and study which one did best.</p><p>Meanwhile, another internet trend has been to render articles \"untethered entities\" in much the same way that Apple's iTunes model ripped singles out of albums. The upshot, with both, is that the fun stuff soars and the worthy stuff fades away.</p><p>Foer's first contention is that this leads to nonsense. For example, last year's inconsequential story about a Minnesota dentist shooting a lion (Cecil, you remember) generated 3.2 million stories online, which he calls \"a deluge of ephemera dissecting the ephemeral\". His second, more contentious contention is that it led to the election of Donald Trump, because the news chased easy hits and Trump's outrages gave them.</p><p>Foer argues that the internet is polarising western societies. \"Facebook has created two hive minds each residing in an ecosystem that nurtures head-nodding agreement and penalises dissenting views.\" We pick a tribe and conform, and cannot break free to empathise with another.</p><p>Foer's solutions to all this are largely regulatory, technical and American, and might not terribly interest British readers. His main concession to a British edition is a foreword that, I must confess, gave me the hump. In it, he suggests that the British press was once a great national strength \"like France's wine or Switzerland's timepieces\", but that it has terribly declined over the past 20 years (ie while I've been working in it). As it happens, I think he's wrong, or not wholly right. Newspapers in the 1990s could be every bit as crap as they sometimes manage to be today.</p><p>Still, his book comes as a rousing recommendation of a subscription model newspaper that avoids the ravages of virality. You're reading one. Well done you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>lion's share The slaughter of Cecil drowned out real news</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-130122888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKR-XKM1-DY9P-N4XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 30, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>PE0009VUU</classCode><className>JEFFREY P BEZOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Civil right advocates have long called for more transparency on the matter, but after seeing how difficult it is to get access to public records pertaining to the use of cell site simulators by CBP and ICE, the American Civil Liberties Union are suing the two government agencies in an effort to bring that information to light. Privacy seems to be at a premium these days, and even big tech companies that are the biggest proponents of more stringent rules[1] don't always practice what they preach. </p><p>Just this past week Apple inadvertently revealed through a lawsuit that it is routinely collecting phone calls and messages of its employees. The Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been involved in numerous privacy debacles over the last few years, but now the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is suing[2] them for failing to produce public materials that disclose how they use \"stingrays.\"Stingrays are essentially cell sites that act like the real ones used by wireless carriers, so they can be used to trick phones into connecting to them. Law enforcement agencies can then identify, locate, and track those phones, but in the process they also get information about phones of innocent people, which introduces the potential for abuse and mishandling of the collected data.According to a 2016 report[3] from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, ICE and CBP had already spent $13 billion on 92 stingrays. Keep in mind that these are also able to observe call records and text messages, and history shows the two agencies aren't doing their best job to protect[4] the data they collect.An ACLU spokesperson notes \"the public has a right to know if and how often ICE and CBP are using Stingrays, which were originally intended for use by the military and intelligence agencies, for civil immigration enforcement operations.\" The civil liberties group is asking the two agencies to sound off on what steps they have taken to ensure stingrays aren't used against innocent bystanders, and whether they disclose their use in immigration court proceedings. We know Stingrays have been in use[5] by law enforcement around the country to conduct surveillance operations, but this could quickly turn into a national security issue. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security said it had knowledge of several unauthorized stingrays[6] operating in Washington, DC, leading to speculation that they may have been used by foreign spies.

We just need to get back to the values of what we had in the past. And if we do that, I think we'll be fine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: Been a pleasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARRY: Thank you, my pleasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LEVIN: Appreciate it. See you next time on \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST, WATTERS' WORLD: Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD. I'm Jesse Watters. Two big exclusives tonight. We have the man who was doxxed by the media for publishing that drunk Nancy Pelosi video and the leader of the Straight Pride March is in WATTERS' WORLD, so stick around.</p><p>All right, comparing state visits. That's the subject of tonight's \"Watters' Words.\" President Trump and President Obama were both invited for State Dinners with the Queen.</p><p>So for fun, we decided to compare how each visit went using the exact same barometers so even the partisans can't argue, so you can see the performances side by side. We begin with the toast. Here's President Barack Obama toasting Her Majesty the Queen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To Her Majesty, The Queen, for the vitality of the special relationship between our peoples, and in the words of Shakespeare, \"To this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.\" To the Queen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: That was so awkward. You don't toast the Queen while the anthem is playing. \"The Globe and Mail\" headline says it all, \"How not to toast the Queen: Obama's awkward Royal gaffe.\"</p><p>Here was President Trump's toast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The brave sons of the United Kingdom and the United States, who defeated the Nazis and the Nazi regime and liberated millions from tyranny. The bond between our nations was forever sealed in that great crusade.</p><p>As we honor our shared victory and heritage, we affirm the common values that will unite us long into the future -- freedom, sovereignty, self- determination, the rule of law and reference for the rights given to us by Almighty God.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: And you see the clink, very smooth. Now, let's look at the gifts that were given. Barack Obama gave the Queen an iPod with his speeches on it. And Donald Trump gave the Queen a Tiffany brooch. Not sure what a brooch is, but I think it's some small pocketbook, a brooch, okay, and we will let the audience decide who gave the better gift.</p><p>Both Presidents famously signed the guest book at Westminster Abbey. My sister is a big-time liberal, sent me an image mocking Trump's inscription that he said the Abbey was a special place. So I immediately wondered, \"Well, what did Obama write?\" It turns out Obama signed the wrong year in the guest book. Barack signed the book 2008 when he was there in 2011.</p><p>Finally, turning to the First Ladies, let's do a little style comparison. Here is Melania in an ivory and navy suit. Very chic, the hat and everything. Here's Michelle, in a more colorful dress which the wind got ahold of, again, style is very personal, so everyone is going to have a different opinion. But I think you know what mine is.</p><p>Here with reaction, media reporter for \"The Hill,\" Joe Concha, Fox News contributor and American Enterprise Institute fellow, Marc Thiessen and Royal expert Katie Nicholl, and she is the author of \"Harry: Life, loss, and love.\" Okay, Katie, let's begin with the gifts. I think the brooch or whatever you call it was a hit compared to an iPod. What did you think?</p><p>KATIE NICHOLL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I completely agree with you. It's a brooch. And the reason you probably don't know what it is because it's quite an old-fashioned piece of jewelry, so a young woman don't really wear brooches that is very much of the Queen's generation and the Queen loves them because of their intricacy. They sit beautifully on the lapel of a dress or a coat.</p><p>She uses them to really send a message out so when she visits Canada, she will wear the maple leaf brooch. When she is in --</p><p>WATTERS: Right, and I don't think she likes the iPod. Is that what I'm picking up?</p><p>NICHOLL: I am not saying -- listen, I tell you, the Queen does not know how to record a voicemail message on a phone. So he she is going to open up an iPod.</p><p>WATTERS: I don't know. That was a long shot. What about the style? You saw Melania looking very gorgeous in the very well-fitting, sleek outfit. Michelle Obama, I'm not sure. You know, she has a different sense of style. How did the styles play in Britain?</p><p>NICHOLL: Listen, they wore completely different styles. I noticed two things. When Michelle was here for the State Dinner, she wore an off the shoulder dress. It was crossed over at the front, and that's a bit risque because you don't show your shoulders at a State Dinner. She also didn't wear a hat once during the visit, while Melania pulled up the stops.</p><p>Not only did she go for a Britannia-themed Gucci dress when she left and --</p><p>WATTERS: And I'm not even sure it's fair that we're showing that side by side because we had the little wind incident there, which you know, she wasn't responsible for.</p><p>All right, Joe, you saw how the media treated this visit. You know, they talked about the protests. How do you think it was covered?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: The protests were covered as mass protest, Jesse, right? And when you compare them to a year ago when the President went there, they were about a third this time around then they were back in 2018.</p><p>WATTERS: So people dislike him less now.</p><p>CONCHA: It seems that way.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay.</p><p>CONCHA: Or just apathy, whatever. But the blimp, they kept concentrating on the Trump baby blimp, like you're looking at the OJ Bronco all over again from 1994 like there's the blimp again.</p><p>WATTERS: Right, and you're there to commemorate, you know, D-Day, a very special moment in the Alliance, and they're focused on an inflatable piece of plastic.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. It was like the Michael Avenatti of blimps, like I turned on cable news and there's the blimp.</p><p>WATTERS: I know. It's like is everywhere you saw, you just saw the blimp. All right, Marc. For me, this was about a special invitation between two countries that share a common language. Common institutions common heritage, commemorating 75 years after America helped save Great Britain essentially. And the Queen invited the President of the United States of America, the office and all the millions of people that President Trump represents that was the point of this visit. Not a blimp, you know, not the gift, none of that.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, and that you're absolutely right on that one completely over the heads of all of Trump's critics in Britain, you know, you had the Mayor of London attacking him. You had Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition who boycotted the dinner.</p><p>And as you pointed out, she invited the President of the United States, not the man who occupies the office. She was honoring the country and the man who leads it and the American people who are her allies and who we fought this great battle together.</p><p>And so when Jeremy Corbyn and some of the opposition leaders don't show up at the dinner, they're not disrespecting Donald Trump, the person; they're disrespecting America. They're disrespecting the office of the Presidency.</p><p>And so I thought it was quite -- you know, the focus on a lot of our media over here is on you know, Trump punching back at some of these guys because he is a counter puncher, but I was shocked, you know, the Royal Family treated him beautifully.</p><p>But I was shocked by how the political establishment and Britain behaved absolutely shamefully towards him.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Because if you're the Mayor of London and two days before the leader of the free world who saved your behind 75 years before comes to visit and you're trash talking him and comparing him to Stalin. What kind of -- I thought the British were supposed to have manners, Marc? I mean, that's not the way you welcome your ally.</p><p>THIESSEN: Well, maybe that was a compliment because Stalin was their ally then.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I mean, and you know what did Trump say? What did Trump say? He said he is like de Blasio, but even dumber and shorter?</p><p>CONCHA: And that's the thing, right?</p><p>THIESSEN: Exactly.</p><p>CONCHA: Because Mayor Khan got a lot of attention, and we hung on every word that he had to say, no media outlet, I saw, Jesse shared what his approval rating is.</p><p>WATTERS: What is it?</p><p>CONCHA: You've got 32 percent satisfactory rating by Londoners. He is a de Blasio.</p><p>WATTERS: So you're saying President Trump's approval is higher than Khan's. I mean, I wish that had been reported.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, President Trump is at 44 percent in the Real Clear Politics index of polls. He is at 48 percent in a Harvard poll, that's the highest since integration. He is trending up ironically, at a time when everybody is talking impeachment.</p><p>WATTERS: And Bill de Blasio has gone from zero percent to 2 percent. So, way to go, Bill. All right, Katie, Joe and Marc, thank you guys.</p><p>A special handshake for a very special relationship. President Trump kicking off his official State Visit to the U.K. greeting Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth, with what looks like a little bit of a fist bump. So what's going on there? Let's ask our body language expert Tonya Reiman.</p><p>All right, Tonya, you see the President approaching, and you know, he extends the hand, and everybody on the internet was looking at it because I think he was grasping the hand here. What was going on there, did you see?</p><p>TONYA REIMAN, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT: Yes. So when you see that, what wound up happening is he is used to a full handshake, right? You see she extends just her fingertips. Yes. So we do this, right. So this becomes odd for him because he's normally used to a regular hand.</p><p>But so this is where you see that he can supplicate, he can actually go down and do an alpha-kind of beta-hybrid when he does this. So what did he do? He grabbed the hand.</p><p>WATTERS: Right, he grabs the hand.</p><p>REIMAN: And then he shook up and down a little bit.</p><p>WATTERS: He did.</p><p>REIMAN: Yes, and then he went side to side because he wasn't really sure.</p><p>WATTERS: He went side to side.</p><p>REIMAN: He went um and then uh.</p><p>WATTERS: Because she presented her hand like this. No one ever presents the President with her hand like that.</p><p>REIMAN: Well, the Queen does, and that's her role. So she was kind of going, \"Oh, this is a normal behavior.\" And he had to then back up and go, \"Wait a minute, who am I with?\" So yes, give the --</p><p>WATTERS: No one ever knows how to greet the Queen. There's always issues. I think Michelle Obama got attacked because she put her hand on the Queen's back at one point, and that's a Royal no-no.</p><p>REIMAN: So did Donald Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: He did it, too.</p><p>REIMAN: He did.</p><p>WATTERS: No American knows what to do when they're presented with a Royalty.</p><p>REIMAN: He needs to be absolutely --</p><p>WATTERS: We have no clue what the etiquette is. We always mess it up. All right, Camilla winked. It was like the wink heard around the world. Let's take a look at this interaction here.</p><p>So you see Camilla off to the right. Oh, did you see that little wink there? Let's see that again. Can we roll that back? Let's see the little wink as she leaves. Slow it down. And then -- what was the wink about?</p><p>REIMAN: You know, that was really a good thing to see from her because people interpret her as so like, stiff and hard. And when you see her wink like that, what you notice first is the smile. So she has this big smile. We don't know for sure who she is winking at. But she has this big smile that comes in naturally. And when you see the smile first and then the wink, you know, it's a genuine movement.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, because the fake news media was trying to spin this, \"Oh, this is a cry for help.\"</p><p>REIMAN: Oh, no, that was a joke. I well -- I don't know if that was a joke, but it was not. I mean, obviously, she put on a very big smile. It was a genuine smile. And she winks and that's the way that you say something like, \"Hey, we have this bond, this relationship,\" some secret.</p><p>WATTERS: Some would say, a special relationship.</p><p>REIMAN: Yes, perhaps.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Tonya Reiman, there she is. Body language expert extraordinaire, knocking down the fake news media. Tonya, thank you.</p><p>REIMAN: Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: YouTube strikes down conservative commentator, Steven Crowder and the man who the media doxxed for creating the drunk Pelosi video speaks to WATTERS' WORLD in an exclusive, next.</p><p>WATTERS: Steven Crowder is a conservative comedian who makes YouTube videos, very popular guy, almost four million followers, and he's been going after vox.com reporter Carlos Maza, who is a liberal guy. He is a gay Latino.</p><p>So the vox.com reporter, Maza was very offended and he demanded that YouTube ban Crowder's videos. And YouTube responded saying that Crowder didn't violate their terms of service, but was harmful to the community. And they've prevented him from making money on his videos until he changes some of the merchandise that he sells.</p><p>Now, many people are wondering how YouTube decides what's harmful, considering some of the left-wing comedians, they have some material on there that's also kind of bad. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, CBS SHOW HOST: You're turning into a real [bleep] hater. We're not broadcasting right now. So I'd say, \"What does Vladimir Putin's [bleep] taste like?</p><p>SAMANTHA BEE, COMEDIAN: You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child. But let me just say one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practices. You feckless [bleep]. He listens to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So Crowder says he's been targeted for just being a conservative comedian. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN CROWDER, COMEDIAN: This isn't just for conservatives now. It's everybody. It's everybody who creates original content because we have not been attacked for being conservative, mind you. At least that's not what they said. It's offensive jokes.</p><p>So if you do jokes that are offensive, they can completely remove your ability to make a living.</p><p>This isn't Carlos Maza. This is absolutely Vox, a billion dollar company that is going after a voice that is more effective than them at dealing with their misinformation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Joining me now with their take on all of this, the host of \"The Michael Knowles Show,\" Michael Knowles and Fox News contributor, Richard Fowler. All right, Michael. I don't think it's that funny what he was saying about this vox.com guy. Perhaps he has some sort of comedic license because he's a comedian, but I didn't laugh about it. But where do you draw the line? He didn't violate the standards, but he was harmful to the community. No one knows what YouTube means anymore. How do you see it?</p><p>MICHAEL KNOWLES, HOST, THE MICHAEL KNOWLES SHOW: Of course YouTube is just using this as an excuse to declare all-out war on conservatives. They admit that Crowder did not violate any of the rules. They said they were going to leave his videos up. Then vox.com launched another campaign, and they said they were going to demonetize him and they're taking away lots of other videos.</p><p>YouTube is going after all conservatives and the timing here is not coincidental. This was not some exasperated frustration from the vox.com journalist. This was a premeditated calculated campaign to take conservatives off of YouTube.</p><p>It occurred two days before Pride Month began, and it occurred two weeks before the first Democratic presidential debate. What this is going to lead to is as the 2020 race heats up, YouTube is going to get rid of conservative videos, they've already said that they are going to start promoting authoritative videos meaning \"The New York Times\" or CNN or any other left-wing news source. It's going to be one giant undisclosed in- kind contribution to Democrats going into 2020, and it's time that we, conservatives litigate them into dust.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Richard, so this reporter used to work at Media Matters. He obviously has a huge agenda. He is admitting it. I mean, he is tweeting out that he wants conservatives to be de-platformed. He is bragging about it.</p><p>And then in another tweet, he is talking about throwing milkshakes on everybody. You know, when they come up to you in the street, you throw a milkshake. So to say he is, you know, the sensitive guy that gets offended. You know, it's tough on the internet. I know what Crowder said was, was homophobic and maybe not that cool if you're on the receiving end of it.</p><p>But the internet is a tough place and the right battles left and this is the age we live in. How do you see it?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, I can't speak to this particular reporter and what he is alleging or not alleging. But YouTube's policy change is something that YouTube is allowed to do. They're a private company. I'm not really sure on what grounds conservative will have to litigate YouTube. Remember, they are a private company. This is their First Amendment right.</p><p>When Crowder signed up to be a YouTuber, he signed just like I did. They signed a user agreement.</p><p>WATTERS: What if they are applying their censorship standards unevenly based on politics?</p><p>FOWLER: Well, no, no. YouTube, when you sign to be part of the YouTube community, you sign a user agreement, and as part of that user agreement, they say they could limit how and what type of videos they put up, and what they deem to be offensive and non-offensive, and that is their First Amendment right as a company.</p><p>It's the same as when Blockbuster was the largest distributor of rental videos. They don't have to carry every single video ever produced, just like when Barnes and Noble was the number one book store in the in the country. They didn't have to carry every book that was ever published.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, Richard, there's a lot of young Americans who don't have any idea what Blockbuster Video is. They don't remember what it was like on a Saturday night when you had to walk to Blockbuster and rent a video.</p><p>FOWLER: That is the reason why I am using that as an empirical example, just like it is -- I get that.</p><p>WATTERS: I know. So Michael, what do you say to Fowler who says that, you know, it's a private company, and they can adjudicate any issues the way they see fit, because, you know, it's not the government.</p><p>KNOWLES: That isn't true. What they're doing is violating the law.</p><p>FOWLER: Which law?</p><p>KNOWLES: Big technology broadly -- the Communications Decency Act of 1996. So what big tech does and YouTube in particular, is they say that they are just an open technology platform. So they don't need to worry about any of the liabilities that go along with publishers -- defamation, copyright infringement, intellectual property, any of that.</p><p>Then they go into a California courtroom -- Facebook did this just last year -- and they say, actually, they are publishers, because they want to be protected by the regulations that govern publishers. They cannot have it both ways.</p><p>The reason for that law in 1996 was to allow the internet to grow and to innovate, and create billion dollar companies like YouTube.</p><p>But now they are clearly acting as publishers, they are exerting editorial influence. They're not even posting rules. They're just saying that their editors will decide what they like and what they don't like. They are a publisher.</p><p>FOWLER: No, that's not true.</p><p>WATTERS: I'll give you the last word, Richard. Go ahead. Thirty seconds.</p><p>FOWLER: That's absolutely not true. What they did is they updated their policy on hate speech. And that's how those videos are demonetized which is nothing about that their editor is doing anything. They had a policy change on how they dictated videos in their community. And based on that, those videos are demonetized and they have the ability to do that under the First Amendment.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, gentlemen, thank you guys very much for a very robust debate.</p><p>FOWLER: Good to see you, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: Coming up, Lou Dobbs in the house. And Lou gets personal like you've never seen him before. You don't want to miss that. And later, the leader of the very controversial Straight Pride Parade is here to explain himself.</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Aishah Hasnie. President Trump receiving praise from Republicans on Capitol Hill after striking an 11th hour deal with Mexico. The U.S. promising to hold off on tariffs that were set to go into effect on Monday.</p><p>In return Mexico has agreed to ramp up its efforts to stop the flow of illegal migration across into the U.S. To help make that happen, Mexico will deploy its National Guard and crackdown on human traffickers.</p><p>A subway car derailing at Boston sending nine people to the hospital, a tenth person was also injured but refused medical treatment. According to emergency officials, none of the injuries are life-threatening. The Green Line Subway car derailed inside a tunnel near Kenmore Square. The cause is still under investigation. I'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SANDERS, ACTING CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION COMMISSIONER: We are in a full blown emergency and I cannot say this stronger. The system is broken. We are well beyond capacity in all of our southwest border custodial facilities. This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Border officials sounding the alarm after more than 144,000 migrants were apprehended in May. It's the highest number in 13 years, a 32 percent increase just from April. And check this out, Customs and Border Patrol releasing this video from Tuesday showing a group of over 130 Central Americans walking around the end of the partially built border wall and then they just surrender to agents right there. They want to be caught.</p><p>Joining me now, host of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" on the Fox Business Network, Lou Dobbs. What do you think about the video? They just walk right around it?</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Well, I think that's the intelligent thing for them to do. What would have been commensurately intelligent would be for the Border Patrol to have been ready at the end of the wall to deal with the onslaught of illegal immigrants.</p><p>WATTERS: So the President comes out and he threatens tariffs on Mexico. That's the only thing that seems to be working because the Mexican delegation scrambles as fast as they possibly can over to the White House to start negotiating.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, well, they stopped. Remember they stopped first with Nancy Pelosi to beg her to find some way to give them relief.</p><p>WATTERS: She doesn't want to do anything either.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I don't think she wants to do anything for the United States. But she might be open to serious consideration of the Mexican interests that seems to be who she is aligned with, as the rhinos and the Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, they are lined up with the cartels.</p><p>This is no longer about being lined up with just the Chamber of Commerce and big business. The radical Dems and the rhino Republicans are straight up wanting to help and support the cartels as much as they can.</p><p>WATTERS: I've said this before. The only people winning at the border are the cartels, the traffickers and the human smugglers. They want open borders, and by giving it to them, they're just making more cash.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. It's a very simple proposition, isn't it? And I love the fact that there are people running around Washington, D.C., Jesse now saying, \"You know, I think we've got a crisis.\" That's what the President declared four months ago.</p><p>This is as moronic a display that I've ever seen in covering the Federal government. The bureaucracy is brain dead. The permanent bureaucracy, the political leadership, I mean this Kevin McAleenan, acting head of DHS, I can't figure out whether he's a politician or he is running as an investment banker, what he wants to do.</p><p>WATTERS: He is certainly acting. That's what we can say.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it is. And it is not a great performance.</p><p>WATTERS: No.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's face it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's not. I want to move on to something a little more uplifting.</p><p>DOBBS: Okay.</p><p>WATTERS: I saw a veteran, he was 93 years old, a British guy. And you know, he is shaking hands with the President and the First Lady and gets a little flirtatious. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I was 20 years younger.</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, you can handle it, no question about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: I mean, only a 93-year-old World War II can get away with that with the First Lady.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it tells you a little bit how he got to 93 that he survived. The man is still all man as that generation was. My gosh. To think of these heroes from the United States, from our allies, the President celebrating them and commemorating that extraordinary moment in our history. It's truly wonderful.</p><p>WATTERS: What did you think about the President's performance overseas?</p><p>DOBBS: This is -- this man stood with the Queen. She has hosted all sorts of dignitaries and leaders from the world. A 90-minute private conversation with the Queen. They obviously reveled in one another's time together. It's just -- and Boris Johnson fell in line, little Sadiq Khan.</p><p>WATTERS: Little Sadiq. What did he say about de Blasio? He is just as dumb, but shorter.</p><p>DOBB: Yes, and I think he is -- he may be even dumber.</p><p>WATTERS: That's true.</p><p>DOBBS: But we should get metrics on it.</p><p>WATTERS: People have been e-mailing me, Lou, they want to know about Lou and what you do on the weekends. You're a mystery man around here, extremely successful, but they want to know, what's the real Lou Dobbs like off camera?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, every bit is brilliant and charming as on camera.</p><p>WATTERS: I knew you were going to say that.</p><p>DOBBS: Look, I usually I'm in my jeans and on the farm and I love to climb on a tractor and play farmer.</p><p>WATTERS: Really? What kind of crops do you have on the farm?</p><p>DOBBS: We have we have hay and horses and grandkids.</p><p>WATTERS: That's -- you've got to water those crops often.</p><p>DOBBS: You better believe it.</p><p>WATTERS: Those kids are growing. All right, Lou Dobbs, everybody, man of the people.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes sir.</p><p>WATTERS: He has got his hands in the soil every weekend.</p><p>DOBBS: You bet. I can't think of a higher compliment than to be a man of the people.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, there he is, Lou Dobbs. Thank you very much for joining WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you. Appreciate it. Good to see you, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: You, too.</p><p>Lou, thank you very much. Kanye West back at it again with the MAGA hats. Diamond and Silk react to that, but first, an exclusive interview with the man who the media doxxed for creating the drunk Pelosi video.</p><p>WATTERS: Remember this video that came out about two weeks ago? Purportedly showing how speaker Nancy Pelosi drunk. Well, it was slowed down to make her speech seem slurred. And here's the real video from that event. As you can see, she's just fine moving at a normal speed.</p><p>Fast forward to last week when \"The Daily Beast\" doxxed a man who say that created the quote unquote \"Drunk Pelosi\" video. They revealed his personal identity and information. And that man, Shawn Brooks joins me now in an exclusive phone interview.</p><p>All right, Shawn, did you create this slow-mo Pelosi video?</p><p>SHAWN BROOKS, DOXXED BY THE DAILY BEAST (via phone): No, I did not create the video, I just shared.</p><p>WATTERS: Who created the video?</p><p>BROOKS: I have no idea. It was shared on the page from another admin that received it via an e-mail.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, so you run a page -- a politics page. Someone shared it with the page and then you pushed it out live, right?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I pushed -- I shared it on my page, almost like eight hours later, but the video was on the national page and it became -- people started sharing it. And then it just blew up.</p><p>WATTERS: It went viral. It went crazy.</p><p>BROOKS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: People who don't know what you look like, you're an African- American. Not a Democrat. Obviously not a fan of Nancy Pelosi. Am I right about that?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I don't -- I'm not a fan of Pelosi. I don't have much -- I mean, besides was in the news, I am not -- I don't have any issues with her like I am not anti or I've got to go out and try to hurt her.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>BROOKS: You know?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>BROOKS: And I am pro-Trump, so --</p><p>WATTERS: Okay, so you're a black Trump supporter, and you put out this video and it goes absolutely viral all over the world. And all of a sudden, what? You get a phone call from reporters, trying to find out what? How -- what happened next?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, the video was out there. I started getting messages and phone calls from different reporters, and one specific guy, Kevin Poulsen. He was -- I blocked him on Twitter. I blocked him all over the place because he kept pounding me like he was pretty much harassing me, and he wanted me to talk to him.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay.</p><p>BROOKS: At this point, I wasn't aware that I was being named the guy, like I heard people saying I did it.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>BROOKS: I was like, I guess he must connect it with me because I just sent out a tweet to one -- it was just there -- it was when I first came out and said that the video was a fake, and that they tried to reach me for comments.</p><p>So I was just replying to the comment saying, you didn't try to reach the page, because I'm one of the admins.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay.</p><p>BROOKS: I didn't post the video, but I am an admin and I checked messages and you didn't try to reach out.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay, so you're getting hounded by this \"Daily Beast\" reporter and you realized at the time when you pushed it out there that it was slowed down, right?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay. And you weren't doing this -- were you doing this just for fun or you were just you know, a video you're trying to get out there and get some clicks? Or was there some sort of diabolical motivation?</p><p>BROOKS: No, I shared it because it was funny. And I saw on Twitter how everyone was saying, \"Is she drunk?\" So I just asked the same question.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay, so you're contacted by \"The Daily Beast,\" And they were on the phone with you for a long time, wrote this huge story about you and named you, named where you lived, talked to an ex-girlfriend. How does that make you feel?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, I feel violated because like the guy got much -- like a lot. He exaggerated a lot of the details. He made up -- he took quotes from one question and added it to another situation like with the -- he put together -- he tried to make me out to be a misogynist the way -- because of my current legal situation that happened with my ex-girlfriend, and he tried to find an old post on Facebook and put it together as, \"Oh, this guy hates women.\"</p><p>And the way it -- and then the racist thing, the African-American comment in the beginning of his article, makes me ought to be -- it's like a -- it sounded like a recent article that he tried to push out that he has feeling about me being a Trump supporter.</p><p>WATTERS: Okay.</p><p>BROOKS: That was his main issue with it.</p><p>WATTERS: So you think he did a dishonest job reporting the story. Do you feel like you're threatened now that your identity is out there?</p><p>BROOKS: Well, I've lost some work. Some people that I did work with go, \"Oh, I can't believe you used to be Trump supporter. I didn't know that.\" Like, it was like I lost a few jobs. I have been threatened. People have threatened me saying that, \"Oh, we've got to find him and get him.\" Stuff like that</p><p>My family members have -- won't even talk to me now. They call me a race trader. Bad for the culture or something like that -- crazy stuff. I mean, it's just been kind of rough. Like I really had no one to really talk to about this one. It blew up like I couldn't really have anyone on the phone, somebody to say, \"Hey, can I just get this off my chest.\" Because everyone, you know, has turned on me.</p><p>WATTERS: Wow. All right. Well, Shawn, I'm sorry to hear that. And I know that litigation might be the next step for you because Facebook also violated your privacy and your opinions. So you know, it's a crazy world out there.</p><p>You know, Bette Midler could tweet out some fake news. And, you know, no one really goes to see who created the fake news that Bette Midler tweeted out, you know, it seems to be a little unfair when these things happen. But hang in there, Shawn, and we appreciate you coming into WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>BROOKS: No problem. Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. Up next, Diamond and silk, Kanye West and Donald Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: President Trump snapping back hard after Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers that she'd rather see Trump in prison than be impeached. Here's how the president reacted with an exclusive with Laura Ingraham.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Nancy Pelosi is a disaster -- I let her do what she wants. I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She's incapable of doing deals. She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person. And she made a statement, while I'm overseas. Now if I made any statement about anybody, it would be like a big head. Why would he do that when he's overseas? Her name? It's Nervous Nancy because she's a nervous wreck.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Wow. Joining me now, Diamond and Silk, the President didn't hold back, did he, ladies?</p><p>LYNNETE \"DIAMOND\" HARDAWAY, FOX NATION PERSONALITY: No, he didn't hold back and he was right. She is nervous. She can't form a sentence. She can't form a complete thought without looking bewildered and perplexed. Yes, she is a disaster.</p><p>But you know what, with all of the atrocities that have been bestowed on minorities in this country, with the crime bill, and you have someone like Nancy Pelosi, who is the third most powerful woman in this country, calling for the imprisonment of the President of the United States, I think all minorities should look at these left-leaning liberals like Nancy Pelosi, this is why we're stuck from people like this here. We need term limits. It's time for Nancy Pelosi to step down.</p><p>ROCHELLE \"SILK\" RICHARDSON, FOX NATION PERSONALITY: That's right. Not only is Nancy nervous, she is also nasty, just like the President said. What she did was very, very rude and it was very, very nasty. And she is a nervous wreck.</p><p>WATTERS: I don't know if you guys saw this, but the Democrats in Congress, they want a pay raise. They just came out and they're going to vote themselves a pay raise. They haven't done much since they took over, but they think they deserve more money. I can't even believe it. But it's true.</p><p>So, Kanye West talking to David Letterman, and he is back at it with the MAGA hat stuff. Listen to how he tells Dave about how bullying the left can be the Trump supporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KANYE WEST, RAPPER/SINGER/SONGWRITER: Have you ever been beat up in your high school for wearing the wrong hat?</p><p>DAVID LETTERMAN, TALK SHOW HOST: I've just been beat up because people didn't like me.</p><p>WEST: Yes.</p><p>LETTERMAN: But I know what you're -- I know what you're saying.</p><p>WEST: The idea is the bullying.</p><p>LETTERMAN: Who is the bully in this scenario?</p><p>WEST: Well, definitely liberals bullying people who are Trump supporters. It's not just calm. You can't just go and wear the hat. You can't just go it's like you, \"[Bleep] you. [Bleep] you.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: You know I want to do a little experiment. What if I went to San Francisco and I wore a MAGA hat. You think someone would knock me out? I think they would. I'd probably duck and weave it, but they'd try.</p><p>HARDAWAY: They may say something to you, but if I put on my MAGA hat, nobody better not say anything to me. Because I have a right to wear whatever I want to.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: Listen, I'm happy that Kanye West is calling out the bullies in this. I wish we would hear his voice more. Don't run inside and hide once you're being bullied. You have to stand up to the bullies. Stand up to these left-leaning liberals and let them know exactly how it's going to be up in this country.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>HARDAWAY: We have a right to wear our Make America Great Again hats. We have a right to support whoever we want to. We stand and support the President of the United States. That's our right and nobody has the right to take that right away from us.</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's right.</p><p>WATTERS: All right. And Silk has got the same hair now as Kanye. They've got the little bleach job up top. I like that.</p><p>RICHARDSON: No, no, no. Kanye has got the same hair as Silk.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, I stand corrected. I stand corrected. You definitely wear it better. All right, ladies. There they are. Chit Chat Tour chugging along. It's going so fast, you can't keep up. All right. Thank you very much.</p><p>The leader of the Straight Pride Parade, very controversial, is next here on WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>WATTERS: A first of its kind parade, maybe making its way to Boston this summer. The organization Super Happy Fun America, made up of three guys is trying to hold a Straight Pride Parade in Boston, because they claim straight people are an oppressed majority. Joining me now is one of those organizers, John Hugo. John, how are straight guys oppressed?</p><p>JOHN HUGO, STRAIGHT PRIDE PARADE ORGANIZER: Oh, well, if we talk about our issues, you know, like we don't want to see children having sex changes because the parents don't like the gender of their child. We're immediately called villains in the mainstream media or things like that.</p><p>But we know -- we are more than three guys by the way. We've got a couple of hundred people already and we're being deluged with e-mails. Half of them hate us and half of them love us so, we're looking at a big crowd.</p><p>WATTERS: What would a Straight Pride Parade look like? I mean, isn't that just most people walking down the street on a normal day?</p><p>HUGO: Well, you know what is wrong with celebrating Straight Pride? It is a sexual orientation. And you know --</p><p>WATTERS: I guess.</p><p>HUGO: Last year, I ran for Congress and this year I've had Sexual Congress because I'm a proud straight man.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you guys have your own Straight Pride flag?</p><p>HUGO: Yes, we do.</p><p>WATTERS: Because the gay people have the rainbow flag. You do. You have your own Straight Pride flag? What's does it look like?</p><p>HUGO: Actually, it's a pink and blue flag with the symbol for male and female on it. The City of Boston actually has denied us the right to do it. We use the exact same language -- there you go -- that LGBTQ Community used and they were approved and got it applied for seven days. We only wanted a couple of hours.</p><p>So the Mass Commission Against Discrimination has now opened a case against them and we're only asking for exclusivity.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, because you want to fly the straight flag all over downtown Boston or just at the City Hall.</p><p>HUGO: No, just on the City of Boston flagpole. They put the Communist Chinese flag up there, but we can't do that. Straights meets Boston.</p><p>WATTERS: So, Boston is putting the Communist Chinese flag up, but they won't put a straight flag up.</p><p>HUGO: Right and they're also in a lawsuit right now because they wouldn't do a Christian flag. It's you know, it's so leftist in Boston, what are you going to do?</p><p>WATTERS: So when you guys get your permit, you're looking for a permit. When you get the permit and you guys do this big, Straight Pride March, are people going to be wearing certain outfits? Because, you know, the Gay Pride Parades are pretty -- they are pretty interesting, let's put it that way.</p><p>HUGO: Well, one of the things we want Jesse is them to add S to LGBTQ for straight. It's more inclusive that way.</p><p>WATTERS: Are you just doing this as a joke to be provocative? Or do you really feel this strongly about this?</p><p>HUGO: Oh, no, no, no, no. We think we think this is great. We have -- we knew we we're going to trigger the left and that's why we called it Super Happy Fun America. Because now you know, the whole Hollywood elite is having a meltdown, \"The View,\" Stephen Colbert who stopped being funny as soon as he became a show for the left, and you know, they are all going crazy.</p><p>WATTERS: So why do you think -- in your opinion -- why do you think they are going crazy? Do you understand why maybe the LGBTQ community is a little bit upset by this?</p><p>HUGO: Well, that's really funny because Milo Yiannopoulos has just become the head of our parade, and we've got a lot of gay people who are helping us. We've got gay allies.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, because Milo is gay, right?</p><p>HUGO: He is gay. We look forward to everybody coming.</p><p>WATTERS: So Milo who is gay is the head of the Straight Pride Parade.</p><p>HUGO: He is going to be our Grand Marshal. We just thought it'd be a lot of fun to have him. He is a conservative.</p><p>WATTERS: Are you sure you want to associate yourself with Milo? He is probably one of the most controversial people out there.</p><p>HUGO: Like this isn't controversial? We're breaking the internet, Jesse. We got to like number three on Twitter the other day.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought you said it's not the controversial. I thought you said the straight ...</p><p>HUGO: Well, I mean, well --</p><p>WATTERS: ... community is not. I guess it is controversial because people are upset by it.</p><p>HUGO: It's half and half.</p><p>WATTERS: That's what I think you mean.</p><p>HUGO: But the criticism is ridiculous. You know, so we have a slogan, \"Don't hate the straight.\"</p><p>WATTERS: Okay. All right. Well, listen, I think --</p><p>HUGO: We are going to have a real fun time.</p><p>WATTERS: I think you guys are going to have more protesters then you're going to have marchers, but you know the cameras will be there. And when you guys do march in Boston, I bet it gets a lot of coverage. All right, John. Thank you.</p><p>HUGO: We're going to have a super happy fun time. Thanks for having us.</p><p>WATTERS: Very much. All right. That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Follow Rookie on Instagram, too @rookiewatters and remember, I'm Watters' and this is my world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019060801cb251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9D-V7X1-DXH2-6000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Foreign Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Royal Family</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Identity Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gender Equality</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

If I'd published what the computer came up with, you'd be reading something like:<br/>\"content that was that communications and everything that makes on a person what they're are also to be in the Internet in the fact about it is that models are technologication of the same that its also from the most computer.\"</p><p><br/>A machine really did come up with that garbage. But let me back up for a second. <br/>A little over a year ago, I started asking around-among computer scientists at universities and tech companies, mostly-to see if someone would help me design and carry out a weird little experiment I had in mind. I wanted to train a machine to write like me. <br/>The idea was this: We'd give Robot Adrienne a crash course in journalism by having it learn from a trove of my past writings, then publish whatever Robot Me came up with. <br/>This isn't a far-fetched idea, and not just because <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/what-is-a-human/473166/\">robots</url> have a long track-record of automating human labor. There are already algorithms that can write stories. At The Los Angeles Times, there's a program that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thewire.com/technology/2014/03/earthquake-bot-los-angeles-times/359261/\">reports breaking news about earthquakes</url>. Bots can easily be programmed to write other basic stories-things like box scores and real estate listings, even obituaries. In January, Wired had a news-writing bot produce       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/we-asked-a-robot-to-write-an-obit-for-ai-pioneer-marvin-minsky/\">a remembrance</url> of Marvin Minsky, the artificial intelligence pioneer. The result was a little dry compared with the obituary for Minksy written by a human at The New York Times-but the machine version was decent. Last year, NPR's Scott Horsley       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">raced</url> a bot to report quarterly earnings for the diner chain, Denny's. Horsely's version had more stylistic flourish, but the bot filed its story in two minutes flat-five full minutes before Horsely, basically an eternity in radio time. <br/>Impressive as these news bots may be, I didn't want Robot Adrienne to be a formulaic speed machine with a Mad Libsian approach to reporting. Instead, I wanted to use a neural network, a computer model inspired by the human brain, that could assess a bunch of input data, infer its structure, then represent that information with its own original output.<br/>This approach could ostensibly produce something more complex and less predictable than the bots that spend their days filling in the blanks. Using a neural network to generate language is, on the simplest level, how human babies learn about language, to they model input from adults, then generate their own output. \"If you think about that loop, babies are taking information in, encoding it, and expressive speech is the output,\"  said Kirsten Cullen Sharma, a neuropsychologist who focuses on child development. \"This is how the brain develops, [and determines] what connections the brain decides to keep.\"<br/>My interest in a neural-net configuration for my experiment was somewhat selfish. These networks are so cool in part because when you give a machine a gob of data, that information is all the machine has to make sense of the world. So when you look at the eventual output, you have the potential to learn quite a bit about the input. If a computer can learn how to write simply by analyzing one person's work, that machine is theoretically in a position to reveal otherwise subtle idiosyncrasies about the input data-a particular writer's structural conventions might become obvious, and other stylistic tics illuminated.<br/>If a robot's eventually going to take my job anyway, why not get it to help me become a better writer first?<br/>Last fall, Google agreed to help me. This was great news. The company's commitment to A.I. research is well documented: It has taught computers to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/robots-hallucinate-dream/403498/\">dream</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/google-deepmind-alphago-ke-jie-match-details/\">defeat humans</url> in abstract strategy games, and to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://http://thenextweb.com/google/2016/06/01/lets-talk-song-google-ai-made/#gref\">compose music</url>. Artificial intelligence is arguably at the heart of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537811/google-rolls-out-new-automated-helpers/\">everything</url>Google is and does.  <br/>But after months of back and forth, with little explanation, the company said it wouldn't be able to help me with my experiment after all. (Understandable, of course, that one of the world's leading tech firms might have other priorities.) I had similar experiences with several other big tech companies that focus on artificial intelligence. <br/>Last month, my editor suggested I ask the writer and technologist       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/writing-with-the-machine/\">Robin Sloan</url>, one of those rare humans who always seems to be effortlessly dabbling in some crazy-brilliant side-project, yet is still somehow kind enough to maybe consider helping a random reporter obsessed with building a robot version of herself. As it happened, Sloan had lately been conducting a similar language-generation experiment of his own: tinkering with a recurrent neural network and a massive chunk of text from the annals of science fiction as a way to see what kind of story a computer mind might write. <br/>So I begged him to help me, and told him about the massive plain text doc of my writing I had all ready to go. <br/>\"I am totally game to train an RNN on your Adrienne Corpus,\" Sloan told me. \"I would definitely set your expectations low-there is no way in which its output will seem like 'a piece by Adrienne'-but at the same time, the things these networks capture-the 'flavor' of text-are, to me, still pretty remarkable.\"<br/>So I sent Sloan the document, which contained painstakingly copy-and-pasted text from two years of published stories-almost all the stuff I'd written for The Atlantic since 2014, totaling 532,519 words. Sloan turned to an open-source Torch-RNN package-      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn\">which you can find on GitHub</url>, courtesy of the Stanford computer scientist Justin Johnson-and he got to work.<br/>\"One of the magical things about this moment in deep learning is that many of core tools have been packaged up and made accessible to enthusiast-level programmers (like me), but that doesn't mean it's exactly straightforward,\" Sloan explained. \"I had to install and configure a scientific computing package called Torch and a bundle of sub-packages that specifically support neural networks.\" He also used a computer with a very fast GPU-experimentation still would have been possible with the kind of processor in a powerful laptop, for instance, but it would have taken a lot longer.<br/>Here's what it looks like when you train a neural network. (Robin Sloan)<br/>It became clear pretty quickly that half-a-million words, or about 3 MB of text, wasn't enough for the neural network to learn language the way I'd hoped. When Sloan entered a prompt-\"The most interesting thing is...\"-here's what the machine spit out in various iterations of the initial experiment:  <br/>The most interesting thing is a different on the past with the distriction of the film of a different of the computer seems of the since something that it was have people in the companies of the most computer that their people of the find of surfect for the profession of the same -- and the prediction of the company state that makes it was something when they were not on the other more of the meanth for the computer that they were all the parence -- and for the way that it is a companies and one of the paternation of the long of the computer in the some hald for a really to the first that has product and computer and companies in for the way that it makes the first that was a stories of the person of a person of the way the first that have a term of the question of the most interesting the computer of where the computer that they are things about the companies that was interested to computer when they were all of the planet of the companies with the most in the way the part of the companies that their experience and...<br/>Here's another example:<br/>The most interesting thing is the one of the could that experience. \"In the paceported by the drate which the nettory ferers of the east desound, the Now that are not be a mabriates, macketing other way for distant to a still provides.

This wasn't exactly a surprise. \"The deal with these networks-the thing that makes them so powerful, but also weirdly fragile-is that they know NOTHING at the outset of their training,\" Sloan said. \"It's not like you tell them, 'Okay, this is going to be English text, look for nouns and verbs, etc.'-it's just a stream of characters. And from that stream, it infers all this amazing structure. BUT the inference requires a lot of input.\"<br/>So we needed more words, but how many?<br/>Sherjil Ozair, a computer scientist at Baidu Research's Silicon Valley AI lab, told me I would probably need more text than I'd ever written. Doubling or tripling the existing sample size wouldn't be enough. \"You'll be able to generate something, but the story won't be legible,\" Ozair told me. \"You really need an order of magnitude like 100 megabytes-but that data doesn't exist, and that's the fundamental problem. We have these methods that could work really well, but only if you have a tremendous amount of data.\"<br/>Increasing my sample size to 100 megabytes would mean going from 500,000 words to something like 18 million-or the equivalent of War and Peace 30 times in a row. That wasn't going to happen, but Sloan was still willing to experiment with a much (much) leaner sample. After hours of piling on the megabytes-adding text from stories I'd written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, Slate, Gawker, Honolulu Civil Beat, and elsewhere dating back to around 2012-I was only up to about 725,000 words. <br/>Sloan ran the experiment again, this time using the prompt, \"She told me...\"<br/>She told me and more like modernings in our computer. Of course, this is not a human work. That's the web that's selfies that would be the moon is that they'll make it online. That's not only more importantly changed and most of them in all of those and questions about their factors. For example, as far several cases, all this kind of regulations for information-that's the person who painted itself that's the technological change of human process. And it's going to be the first electric companies that can make it into their context in places-is not a technological computer. Scientists reported her everything that's because there's also an interview that there's something like a story of the findings of their work. But that's what does it reported by their work. This is that Internet connections can complete the way that these people are searching to their cars and the passage of itself. And that's the situation of the library's first computer that was more likely to have all this person betwe...<br/>There was a slight difference, but the output still wasn't exactly publishable, not even close. So Sloan encouraged the model to be less conservative, riskier in its predictions about which letter to generate next in sequence. \"Those predictions are hedged and probabilistic, not definite: at every step, the net establishes a probability for every possible next character,\" Sloan explained. <br/>When a model is less risky, it's more likely to be repetitive. (That's why, on the most conservative setting, the Adrienne Corpus produced sentences like this: \"The most people who are all the story of the company and the story of the story of the story of the company and the first place.\") But too risky can predict its own breed of nonsense. Here's what the riskier model based on my larger sample of writing produced: <br/>She told me that the first # years ago in a decade from the Times-even as well as much them. \"The background change was created the world that was focused on a time that the pool can make the world.\" The format points that they weren't always \"demonstrating and being solved with organizations over time. (Researchers have been spuns from the property source of the town of a being print people who are likely to try on the platform, and the Internet age is perfectly happening a diversity of a screen. In an excerpt, like himself, the people so we're really been right at the past year. \"The world is long and browse discourse,\" George We said. \"It was also a significant model that makes it interesting.\" March #, you can see the algorithms. The currency of the site servers shifted the first time when the GoPro does it is an infectious earthquakes and technology in the film in a myth. And the sweet was the biggest project, scientists were built before the internet, it was probably looking for this tech...<br/>And here's another example from a riskier model:<br/>She told me to any new assault. \"I was recorded in the world's book,\" said Marty McBring, a historian of Security Trust and Army CH for earlier his research in #. \"The appeal of a little idea was when and what it's hard to release the most politicism they didn't use the brand of same-time. And they take a process of magnitude to the ground it was like before. I would come out with the classification of engineering, the same emergency and the design we didn't interact themselves so that a sort of three poys material. The larger device is more more than the error and the process of what we go online. That's why you can do something about the person more than the moon were encourages that Catholic levels of the U.S. Geological Handburg. But a colleague is about amerscare structures. They probably be able to only use much of the technical cortain-partace group. \"We have a mere of earthquake and main the smoke -- which could be a health point and information to the computer behaviors of what he was now\"<br/>\"In general, I think these big blocks of text don't show the RNNs at their best-because, again, they have no sense of the larger structure of a piece of writing,\" Sloan said. \"It's the shorter 'completions' that are more compelling.\" (You can see some of the autocompletes from Sloan's sci-fi experiment       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/writing-with-the-machine/\">on his website</url>.)<br/>And yet there are still some delightful surprises in the text Robot Adrienne produced. I liked how the moon kept coming up, for instance, and I found myself lingering on made-up words like \"somethative,\" \"macketing,\" and \"replored,\" the last of which sounds vaguely French. (\"As you can see, the model trained on ~3MB of text is still making a lot of spelling errors, and taking stabs at words like 'technologication' which I think is pretty cute,\" Sloan wrote in an email after the first round of experimentation.)<br/>In later rounds, using the larger dataset, Robot Me began to include quotes in its work, which is pretty good in terms of journalistic mimicry! Quotes like this one: <br/>\"I was recorded in the world's book,\" said Marty McBring, a historian of Security Trust and Army CH for earlier his research in #.<br/>And this one: <br/>\"The world is long and browse discourse,\" George We said. \"It was also a significant model that makes it interesting.\"<br/>Even as the field of machine learning blossoms, language generation hasn't fundamentally changed in recent decades. Jaime Carbonell, the director of the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, told me that one of the first projects he worked on in the 1970s had to do with building a language generator. <br/>\"It's evolved, and it's improved, but there hasn't been what I would call a revolution in this particular field,\" Carbonell said. \"What the machines can do is express weather forecasts based on meteorological data, or a baseball narrative based on the scoresheets-pretty good writing that is almost indistinguishable from human writing when reporting facts in a formulaic style.\"<br/>\"But the question that doesn't have an answer,\" he added, \"Can a machine acquire general intelligence? So far, the answer has been, 'no.' There are things like writing fiction or writing poetry where it's not clear what it means for a computer to be able to do it, since the machine can not directly experience the emotions you're trying to convey. It's difficult to fathom how you could generate genuine creative writing in that sense. There are categories of activities in which it doesn't really make sense to train the computer to do it. You would just get some ersatz version of a human.\"<br/>My favorite line from one of Robot Adrienne's stories is, I think, this one: \"Of course, this is not a human work.\" <br/>Not exactly. Enabling a computer to teach itself to write, even once the machine gets the hang of it, actually is human work-even if human jobs are made obsolete as a result.<br/>So far, the ersatz version of me has quite a bit to learn. <br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/story-by-a-human/485984/\">A Computer Tried (and Failed) to Write This Article</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-acomputertriedandfailedtowritethisarticle485984</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JYV-YGS1-DYY9-J1TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Greg Steube (R-FL) questioned an Apple executive about iPhone alerts encouraging him to pay $0.99 for iCloud storage during a hearing on Tuesday examining whether large tech platforms hinder innovation and entrepreneurship within the industry. Apple[1] only provides 5GB of free iCloud storage to customers, whereas Google offers 15GB of free cloud storage to it users. </p><p>Apple previously upgraded the amount of local storage in most iPhone models after facing criticism for years. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] If you own an iPhone, you're probably familiar with that notification reminding you that you're almost out of iCloud storage. That's because Apple only offers 5GB of free storage and requires you to sign up for a monthly plan if you want additional space, with the lowest option starting at $1 per month for 50GB. That's presumably what Rep. Greg Steube of Florida was referencing when he questioned Kyle Andeer, Apple's vice president of corporate law and chief compliance officer on Tuesday. Andeer was testifying alongside executives from Google, Facebook, and Amazon at a Congressional subcommittee hearing about large tech platforms and the influence they have on innovation and entrepreneurship. When questioning Andeer, Steube said he often sees an alert asking him to pay $0.99 for iCloud, adding that the alert doesn't disappear unless the $0.99 is paid. \"I've got a very important question for Apple that I believe is on the mind of all Americans,\" Steube said. \"Why do you keep getting that alert for the iCloud, for the $0.99 on the iCloud? All the time, constantly, constantly. Until you pay the $0.99 for the iCloud, and then you're paying the $0.99 for iCloud but you're not using it,\" he said. Andeer said he was not aware of the details around Steube's question and that he would get back to him with additional information. The comments underscore the criticism[3] Apple[4] has faced in recent years over the amount of storage it offers for free compared to rivals like Google. Those who sign up for a Google account get 15GB of free storage across services including Google Drive, Google Docs, and Gmail. Apple does offer more free storage than Dropbox, however, which only provides users with 2GB of complimentary space. Apple also recently expanded the amount of free storage to 200GB for students, but standard customers are still limited to the 5GB of space Apple has been offering since it unveiled iCloud in 2011. Apple has not made any public indications that it plans to change that anytime soon. But after it was widely criticized for only offering 16GB of storage in the entry level model of the iPhone, it changed its lowest storage option to 32GB starting with the iPhone 7 in 2016. It then boosted that to a minimum of 64GB of storage with the introduction of the iPhone 8.NOW WATCH: Here's why phone companies like Verizon and AT...harge more for extra data[5]See Also: Tired of the App Store asking you to rate or review an app?

The attendees, who included such right-wing Internet luminaries as Diamond and Silk and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, were even treated to a vintage diatribe against the mainstream press: \"The media says - the establishment media, the fake media - they say, 'Aww, there's no censorship in social media! That's all made up, that's all fake.' You and I know that's not true.\"</p><p>It was classic Trump. Only it wasn't Trump. That last bit was delivered by Josh Hawley, a 39-year-old Republican freshman senator from Missouri who has quickly become the face of the conservative side of the backlash against Silicon Valley. Half a year into his first term, he has introduced a raft of legislation aimed at cracking down on some of the business practices of giants like Facebook and Google. And, somewhat improbably for a Republican senator who often speaks in the language of Trumpian grievance, much of this legislation has been bipartisan. In March, he teamed up with Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a bill to strengthen online privacy protections for children; then in May, he partnered with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on the Do Not Track Act, which would let users opt out of having their data mined.</p><p>All of this has earned Hawley accolades from across the aisle, even though the bills stand little chance of becoming law anytime soon, and some of them strike experts as clunky and overbroad. (A measure he introduced in late July - the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act - reads like a parody of hyper-regulation: \"[T]he operator shall present the user with an option to decline by clicking an icon that is identical to the other icon in terms of size, shape, font, and other visual or auditory design.\") Feinstein told me that she and Hawley are \"both advocates for individual control of personal data.\" Warner said, \"It's great to work with a Republican partner who is thinking deeply about these issues.\" And Markey called Hawley \"a tenacious privacy advocate.\"</p><p>The senator from Missouri - a devout Christian conservative and former law professor, widely seen as a likely 2024 presidential contender - says his goal is to hold tech companies accountable. \"These companies, Google and Facebook in particular - Twitter, too - have built a model based around exploitative and addictive practices,\" he told me recently. \"I think we need to be asking ourselves, 'What is it that these companies have really given this country? Have they increased our economic productivity? Have they given us new and better jobs at higher wages? Have they made us more literate? More hospitable?' I don't think so. I think the answer is 'no' to all those questions.\"</p><p>Hawley's mix of policy entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship, anti-tech zeal and Trump-style provocation doesn't, of course, always win friends on the left - and, in fact, it can sometimes prove off-putting to conservatives. Consider legislation he introduced in June that would crack down on alleged anti-conservative bias in online searches and social media. The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would force large tech companies - under penalty of losing their immunity from what their billions of users do on their platforms - to submit to federal audits to ensure they don't engage in politically biased moderation.</p><p>The bill attracted zero co-sponsors and was panned on both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals argued that there's no evidence of anti-conservative censorship on the big platforms; to the contrary, conservative outlets like Fox News do quite well in Facebook engagement, and YouTube's recommendation algorithm has been great for right-wing channels. Many conservatives, meanwhile, balked at the notion of empowering the federal government to regulate speech online. \"Josh Hawley's Internet Censorship Bill Is an Unwise, Unconstitutional Mess,\" declared a headline in the National Review.</p><p>Yet Hawley remains defiant. And why shouldn't he? The bill curried favor with Trump, the only Republican endorsement that matters. Moreover, the politics of tech have changed dramatically - in Hawley's direction - during the Trump era. Silicon Valley was long politically untouchable, insulated on the left by its ties to the Democratic establishment and on the right by a stable pro-corporate, free-market consensus. Trump's election threw both dynamics into question. Democrats have realized that social media platforms very likely enabled Trump's victory, no matter the political leanings of Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg. And Republicans increasingly understand that the GOP base has little affection for long-standing party orthodoxy on economic issues; maybe corporations - especially those tech companies seen as progressive - aren't untouchable just because they're profitable.</p><p>The result of all this is a D.C. environment that has become far more hostile to Big Tech, with the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and House Judiciary Committee recently launching parallel investigations of the major players. \"The tech companies and their allies need to be really careful in this world,\" says Zach Graves, head of policy at the Lincoln Network, a conservative tech-focused think tank. \"A lot of them are still operating on George Bush-era assumptions about what the rules are. I don't think those rules apply anymore, and Hawley is great proof of that.\"</p><p>But Hawley may not be content to stop with Big Tech. In July, he introduced a bill with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to lower the value of the dollar - a serious break from long-standing Republican consensus on trade. And in a speech he gave not long after the social media summit, he took shots at both parties for worsening the nation's economic divide: \"For years, the politics of both left and right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities,\" he declared, adding: \"And where has this left middle America? Well, with flat wages, with lost jobs, with declining investment and declining opportunity.\"</p><p>You can almost hear those words coming from the mouth of someone like Bernie Sanders - and they raise tantalizing questions about just how far the bipartisanship of Josh Hawley and those who share his views may, or may not, plausibly go. Is the overlap between the left and Hawley-ism like the middle of a Venn diagram? Or is it more like the momentary intersection of two lines pointing in very different directions, and diverging outward to infinity?</p><p>          Like many political phenoms who seem to emerge out of nowhere onto the national stage, Hawley's preparations for a career in public office began early. Growing up in Lexington, Mo., a small town surrounded by farmland about an hour's drive east from Kansas City, Hawley showed a keen interest in what was happening in Washington. While still in high school, at a private Catholic prep school in Kansas City, he wrote an opinion column for his hometown newspaper called \"State of the Union.\" (Sample take: \"The American people no longer want security provided by the government; they want freedom to provide their own security unhindered by government.\")</p><p>As a freshman at Stanford, Hawley approached historian David M. Kennedy to do an independent study about the history of the presidency. Kennedy was reluctant. \"I gave him a list of pretty heavy readings going back to the 19th century, frankly expecting I'd never see him again,\" he recalls. Hawley returned two weeks later and Kennedy, skeptical that he had actually absorbed the reading, quizzed Hawley on the contents. \"He nailed every question absolutely perfectly. It was clear he had read it all carefully, critically, assimilated it, thought it through. It was a truly impressive response from a young student.\"</p><p>Later, Kennedy supervised Hawley's senior thesis, an intellectual history of Theodore Roosevelt that would turn into a book. \"It might have been one of the most impressive senior theses that I supervised over more than 40 years of teaching at Stanford,\" Kennedy says. At the same time, Hawley was very much a politician in the making: \"It was clear he had that kind of ambition. He had the whole package from a very early age.\"</p><p>After Stanford came Yale Law School, where Hawley led the school's chapter of the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal network. Ian Bassin, who was Hawley's liberal counterpart as president of Yale's American Constitution Society, remembers Hawley as a \"religious and moral person\" who had compassion for people with different views. \"Those of us who really appreciated talking to people we didn't agree with, we found Josh to be genuinely principled and interesting,\" he told me. \"It was a good back and forth that we had.\"</p><p>At Yale, Hawley made an important early political connection. Harold Hongju Koh, then the Law School dean and a fixture of the Democratic foreign policy establishment, had invited former senator John Danforth, a pillar of the Missouri Republican Party, to give a talk. Afterward, at a dinner party, Koh made a point of sitting Danforth next to one of his students, a young conservative from Missouri. \"He is just such a good person that I want you to know him,\" Danforth recalls Koh saying. Koh remembers the setup slightly differently. Hawley \"was eager, desperate to meet Danforth, and I like to help my students achieve what they want, so I introduced them to each other,\" he says. Either way, it was the start of a friendship - one that would come in handy when Hawley was ready to enter Missouri politics.</p><p>Following law school, Hawley spent a year clerking for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and he began dating a co-clerk, Erin Morrow, who would become his wife. After a stint at D.C. law firms, they joined the University of Missouri Law School faculty, while Hawley also worked for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest law firm.</p><p>His writings from those years provide a window into his politics. In a 2010 essay for National Affairs titled \"America's Epicurean Liberalism,\" he wrote that the \"celebration of individual will\" is \"closely associated with a series of prominent dysfunctions in contemporary America.\" By Hawley's account, the growth of a liberal state devoted to individualism had paradoxically reduced liberty by replacing the functions of civil society with government - \"too often leaving no room for the mediating institutions of family, churches, civic associations, and fraternal groups that keep society strong and free.\"</p><p>Hawley stresses that he doesn't think the government has any business directly promoting Christianity. But his views on religion certainly place him toward the far right of the spectrum. This spring, he shocked even Republican colleagues by torpedoing a federal judicial nominee who, as a lawyer representing East Lansing, Mich., had defended the application of that city's anti-discrimination law against a Catholic-owned orchard that announced it wouldn't allow same-sex marriages on its property. And in Missouri in 2018, he drew criticism for suggesting that the 20th-century sexual revolution was responsible for sex trafficking \"on a scale that we would never have imagined.\"</p><p>          In his book, \"Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness,\" which he published when he was just 28, Hawley describes a scenario that may sound familiar. For the election of 1884, the Republican Party nominated James G. Blaine, a controversial presidential candidate with a history of sketchy real estate dealings and an economic platform centered on protective tariffs. A number of high-minded GOP members broke ranks and refused to support him. But Roosevelt, an up-and-coming Republican politician, decided to set aside his contempt and back the nominee in the name of party loyalty. \"Politics,\" he told himself, in Hawley's summary, \"was a rough business; the political man must, to do any good, be willing to work with the less-than-ideal.\"</p><p>Hawley has taken many of his cues from the iconoclastic former president, his boyhood hero. Like Roosevelt, who grew up wealthy in New York City but remade himself as a rugged outdoorsman, Hawley has cultivated an image as a political outsider. In 2016, when he ran for Missouri attorney general, his campaign produced an ad featuring him walking toward the camera as, all around, men in suits climb literal ladders. Hawley is tall, lean and muscular, with a thick swoop of brushed-back brown hair and a narrow, serious face. Speaking in the sonorous baritone of a radio announcer, he says: \"Jefferson City is full of career politicians just climbing the ladder. I think you deserve better.\" A narrator's voice concludes: \"Josh Hawley. Conservative. Outsider. Attorney general.\"</p><p>The 2016 race was Hawley's first foray into politics. That November, he cruised to victory, winning slightly more votes statewide than even Trump. From the beginning, he did not behave like someone content to stay on the bottom rung. An investigation by the Kansas City Star found that, as attorney general, Hawley's payroll included a team of D.C.-based political consultants, who helped choreograph high-profile initiatives including litigation against opioid manufacturers and a raid on alleged sex traffickers, where Hawley appeared, camera-ready, wearing a law-enforcement badge around his neck. (The consultants were paid not by the attorney general's office but by Hawley's campaign committee, which is allowed under state law.)\u00a0What drew Hawley's first national headlines, however, was the announcement of an antitrust investigation against Google - a sign both of his early interest in the subject and of its political potential.</p><p>The ladder-climbing ad became infamous in Missouri politics when, less than a year into his term, Hawley announced he was running to try to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D). Hawley, who was heavily recruited to join the race, insists that the Senate wasn't on his mind when he ran for attorney general.</p><p>It was during his Senate race that Hawley's current public persona started coming into view. In his campaign announcement video, flanked in the family kitchen by his wife and two young sons, he began laying down the anti-elite refrain he has been humming ever since. \"The D.C. career crowd just keeps on doing the same old thing,\" he told the camera. \"And you know? The system works pretty well for them. They're connected.\"</p><p>His challenge, as Missouri political reporters Lindsay Wise and Bryan Lowry would later write, \"was to convince both the populist, Trumpian wing of the Republican Party and the country club establishment that he was secretly one of them - and that he was just humoring the other guys.\" Early on, it looked like that might prove difficult. In August 2017, Hawley skipped a Trump rally in Springfield; the week before, his political mentor, Danforth, had published a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post urging Republicans to break with the president. After Hawley refused to denounce Danforth, a pro-Trump Republican threatened to jump into the race. According to news reports at the time, Hawley's campaign grew worried that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon would follow through on threats to back a primary opponent, and Hawley called Bannon to assure him they were on the same team. The next time Trump came to Missouri, Hawley was there to greet him. After that, Trump became a frequent visitor to the state, appearing with Hawley at a rally the night before the election. The next day, Hawley defeated McCaskill 51\u00a0percent to 45\u00a0percent.</p><p>Hawley's embrace of Trump and other politically expedient positions - he ran ads declaring his support for coverage of preexisting conditions even as he joined litigation to overturn the Affordable Care Act - strained some relationships. \"I was deeply disappointed in his behavior,\" Koh told me. \"It shocked me he was so eager to win he was ready to say pretty much anything.\"</p><p>Danforth, who in an interview described himself as a friend and admirer of Hawley, didn't criticize him directly - but he made clear that he dislikes anti-elite populist rhetoric. \"That's just a standard political style today, to try to convince people that they're being victimized by the in group, the powerful,\" he said. \"I think it's wrong.\"</p><p>Some of Hawley's Yale classmates, including former friendly rival Bassin, also wrote an open letter to Missouri voters blasting him. \"We may not have always agreed with Josh's politics during law school, but those of us who knew him respected his principles,\" they wrote. \"We have been saddened to see Josh abandon those principles as he tries to climb the political ladder.\"</p><p>          Every politician faces questions about authenticity; the unusual thing about Hawley is that the private version of him appears to be more likable than the political one. When I asked his wife, Erin, to tell me something that most people don't know about him, she said: \"I would probably say the fun side. He has a wicked sense of humor and so we laugh a lot. ... I'm not sure you get that from the public persona.\"</p><p>Indeed, the public Hawley is dependably grim. In Senate hearings, he's sarcastic and stern. During one hearing a week after the White House social media summit, he verbally cornered Karan Bhatia, vice president of public policy at Google, letting Bhatia repeat his assurances that Google would never censor or filter results based on political viewpoints, before pouncing on the fact that the company deployed a censored search engine in China for four years before shutting it down in 2010. \"You have been more than happy to partner with the most repressive authoritarian regime on the planet,\" Hawley said from the dais. \"All for profits. Whatever it is that's good for Google. Why would anybody believe you now?\"</p><p>In other settings, Hawley can be downright apocalyptic. A few hours after the Google hearing, he was at a hotel in Washington delivering a keynote speech to the first National Conservatism Conference, a three-day gathering of the nascent movement to impose intellectual architecture on the post-Trump conservative coalition. \"The fate of our republican government is at issue,\" he warned, raising the specter of a \"cosmopolitan elite\" with questionable allegiances. \"This class lives in the United States, but they identify as 'citizens of the world.' They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community.\"</p><p>The speech drew warm applause in person, but Hawley's rhetoric didn't go over so well online. A number of Jewish and left-leaning critics, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, called out Hawley's notion of a \"cosmopolitan\" elite as anti-Semitic. (\"Rootless cosmopolitan\" was a common anti-Semitic slur in the Soviet Union, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories often depict Jews as globalists who are disloyal to the nations they live in. \"If you're Jewish and the use of 'cosmopolitan' doesn't scare you, read some history,\" Krugman tweeted.)</p><p>Hawley, as always, was unapologetic. \"When it comes to liberals,\" he told Tucker Carlson the following week on Fox News, \"there's only one thing that they love more than being elites, and that's accusing everyone else of being bigots.\"</p><p>When I met Hawley in his Senate office the next day, however, there was little trace of that hostility. In person, he was a totally game interview subject, playful, quick to laugh, including at himself, and to smile broadly. Even his theory of politics was subtly different. In speeches and Fox News appearances, he portrays elites as scheming and disloyal; at the conference, he argued that \"the leadership class have tried to build a new state in their own image.\" But when we spoke, he seemed more understanding. \"I think both parties were probably caught off guard by this, frankly, by these developments over the last 20 or 30 years, because the neoliberal consensus, if you like, predicted something different,\" he said, leaning back, one arm draped over his office's leather couch. \"And now we've got to think through what do we do about that.\"</p><p>I asked him what he meant by \"cosmopolitan elite\" - and how someone with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't qualify. \"The problem is not people going to places like Stanford or Yale, or wherever they go,\" he said. \"The problem is thinking that just because that's something that they wanted to do with their lives, that their priorities and their ambitions and their values should control the whole rest of the country's.\"</p><p>Hawley insists that his evocation of \"the great American middle\" is not code for whites or Christians. \"In this country, we are proudly and rightly - we're not united by blood, we're not united by ethnicity, we're not united by race,\" he said. \"We are united by the things we love together. And in loving those things together, we come to love each other. That has got to be our goal, and that has got to be our aspiration.\"</p><p>It's poetry. Who could object to coming together in love? (At that point, I scribbled in my notebook: \"Marianne Williamson?\") But an unpleasant corollary is that there's another group of Americans who don't love the same things. According to Hawley, that's an elite made up of Wall Street, Hollywood, academia, the news media - and, of course, Big Tech.</p><p>          Defining politics in opposition to some enemy of the masses is the very definition of populism, and the role that the cosmopolitan elite play in Hawley's rhetoric is similar to the one that \"millionaires and billionaires\" play in Bernie Sanders's. In fact, Hawley sometimes seems like a walking manifestation of horseshoe theory - the idea that the political spectrum is not a line, but a curve along which the far left and the far right eventually bend toward each other. \"These orthodoxies, plural, that have defined our politics, really since the Second World War, it is time for them to be put to rest,\" he told me.</p><p>And yet, with the major exceptions of trade policy and his willingness to aggressively regulate Big Tech, it's hard to find examples of Republican orthodoxy that Hawley actually rejects. He supported the 2017 tax cut, which heavily benefited corporations and the wealthy, and told me he still thinks it was a good idea. In Missouri, he backed a right-to-work law that voters overwhelmingly rejected in a statewide referendum. And while Hawley expresses general concern about the threat of rising corporate concentration, especially to small businesses, he hasn't co-sponsored any of the bills Senate Democrats have introduced to strengthen antitrust enforcement. (In a statement, Hawley's spokesperson pointed out that Hawley asked about antitrust and tech during Attorney General William Barr's confirmation hearing. \"As he has said consistently,\" the spokesperson noted, \"antitrust enforcement is a critical tool in the competition policy tool kit, and he is friendly to all efforts to begin a conversation about how best to use and strengthen those tools.\") I was surprised to have to prod him to discuss Amazon, a corporation that in some ways dominates the economy more than any of the other tech giants and may be doing the most to crush independent merchants. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Since his speech at the National Conservatism Conference, a fair bit of liberal commentary has pointed to Hawley's political positions and wondered whether he's a \"real\" populist. That may be the wrong question. Populism isn't an ideology; it's a style, not wedded to any particular policy agenda. J.D. Vance, the conservative author of \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and a friend of Hawley's, told me he thinks Hawley is betting that the Republican Party can be the first to win over an American working class that is to the left of the GOP economically, but to the right of the Democrats on social issues. The challenge - especially as long as Trump leads the party - is figuring out how to appeal to working-class whites, whose cultural conservatism heavily centers on immigration and race, without alienating minority working-class voters.</p><p>Hawley attempts this by blaming the declining economic fortunes of the working class not primarily on illegal immigration, but on the various manifestations of cultural liberalism. Philosophers and screenwriters are, in this telling, somehow responsible for offshoring jobs to China. \"I think the big divide of our time is between the leadership class and their aspirations and their value set and their ideals, and the aspirations and ideals and therefore the lives of the folks in the middle of our country,\" he told me. \"And our economic structure reflects that.\"</p><p>This theory helps explain why social media is such a natural target for Hawley. If any place in America combines liberal cultural values with a hardcore capitalist streak, it's Silicon Valley. Conservatives even have a name for this: \"woke capital\" - the idea that corporations engage in performative cultural progressivism to stave off criticism of their business practices.</p><p>Hawley's anti-censorship bill is \"one of the best examples that we have of what a nationalist would mean when they say they want to use political power to address a cultural problem,\" says David French, author of the National Review piece criticizing the legislation. \"The one area in which the right broadly has been much more successful is politics, and the left has been broadly successful in culture, and therefore [they think] what we must do to save our nation is exert political power to change the national culture.\"</p><p>This is where the left and right critiques of corporate America part ways. To a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren, the problem with woke capital is the capital. To a Josh Hawley, it's the wokeness.</p><p>To the left, the sweeping social changes over the past 40 years happened despite a growing economic divide. But to Hawley, the former caused the latter. The rise of an individualist culture that devalues traditional Christian morality, hard work and civil society is responsible, along with the endurance of the post-New Deal welfare state, for the hollowing out of the middle class. If you believe that, then of course your political program is going to look nothing like that of a liberal who wants to raise the minimum wage and expand the social safety net. \"That doesn't give people dignity,\" Hawley told me. \"That doesn't give them the ability to manage and control their own lives.\"</p><p>This is why, despite the surface-level overlap between left- and right-wing economic populism, they remain so irreconcilably opposed. Both sides might hate Big Tech; both sides might justify their policy objectives in terms of reviving the economic fortunes of middle America. But because their theories of what has gone wrong are almost entirely different, they will continue to pull in opposite policy directions. And they will continue to train their anger on (mostly) different enemies.</p><p>After about an hour, Hawley's staff finally persuaded him to wrap up the interview so he could make his next appointment. As we stood up, I squeezed in one more question: Did he really believe the media was ignoring censorship of conservatives, as he had said with his \"fake media\" comment at the social media summit? \"My sense is the mainstream media thinks that is just ridiculous, that it's a joke,\" he said. But \"fake news\" is such a loaded term, I countered - it implies malice. \"There might be some malice,\" he responded, with a sly wink, as we headed for the door. \"Not for everybody, but I think there's some malice out there.\"</p><p>          Gilad Edelman is executive editor of the Washington Monthly.       </p><p>          Clarification: A sentence has been added to make clear that consultants hired by Hawley were paid not by the Missouri attorney general's office but by Hawley's campaign committee, which is allowed under state law.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-dbe23e2222ab415a8f8e0561ca561713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXG-1N81-JB4M-V4BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4684\"/><timeReceived>3:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 28, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tarleton Gillespie is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, an adjunct associate professor in the department of communication at Cornell University and the author of an important recent book, \"Custodians of the Internet\" (Yale University Press, 2018), on how firms like YouTube moderate content. I asked him what was going on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Henry Farrell: Ordinary understandings of language would suggest that calling someone a \"lispy queer\" is homophobic harassment. Why did YouTube seem to disagree?</p><p>             Tarleton Gillespie: It's difficult to guess what the conversation sounds like inside YouTube. On its face, I find Crowder's videos homophobic, and Carlos Maza, who was on the receiving end of these slurs, thinks so, too. Crowder certainly does not. But of course, it doesn't matter what I think, and in some ways it doesn't matter what Maza or Crowder thinks, either. Currently, it's YouTube who gets to decide which videos to remove and which to keep up. Its right to make this decision itself, on our behalf, is protected by U.S. law and has become the norm for most social media: Platforms set guidelines for what speech and behavior they allow on their site, and reserve the right to remove content or suspend users who violate those guidelines.</p><p>That said, YouTube's decisions are not without consequence. The user base is increasingly frustrated with how YouTube polices the site - or fails to. Some feel it too often overlooks harassment like this, even boosting its visibility through its recommendation algorithms. Others say YouTube is silencing speech that should be protected, especially conservative perspectives like Crowder's. Still others think it's unclear about what the rules are, and inconsistent in how they're applied. In the face of this frustration, YouTube (and other platforms like it) fall back on making broad categorical decisions: not are these particular slurs wrong or cruel, but are they \"harassment\" under the company's terms? Are they \"hate speech\"? Are they \"bullying and abuse\"? In the absence of justice, it opts for consistency.</p><p>Of course, it can't achieve consistency, either. What would it even mean to be consistent, across thousands of videos, saying slightly different things, in different ways, in different contexts? So it tends to fall back on standard, familiar notions. And homophobic slurs still don't carry the cultural weight of racial ones. Not long ago it was acceptable to call someone a [homophobic slur] - as Crowder does in the T-shirt he's wearing in some of the offending videos - and have it pass as a joke, maybe in poor taste, but not harassment or hate. YouTube here has failed to appreciate the cultural shift in how we think about homophobia.</p><p>             HF: Why have YouTube and other platforms found themselves in the situation of having to moderate the speech of their users?</p><p>             TG: Well, we can say they brought it on themselves. Platforms wish they could be the open Web done right: that they help us all join in, say what we want, find entertainment and community - and they get some ad dollars in the process. What they quickly found was that building community requires dealing with social tensions; that providing people a way to be heard means they will use that tool to their own ends, whether noble or cruel.</p><p>On the other hand, what's the alternative? It's easy to criticize platform moderation by condemning intervention of any kind. But a site with no rules whatsoever quickly fills with spam, porn, brutality and contraband. Hosting and delivering information means, inevitably, making choices about how and why to do so - through the design itself and the policies imposed. It is only a question of what the rules should be, how they are enforced and - I think this is important - who should make them.</p><p>             HF: After announcing that it would not remove Crowder's videos, YouTube then announced that his channel would be demonetized until he could \"address the issues with his channel.\" What does that mean?</p><p>             TG: YouTube has long had a Partner Program that gives users with sizable audiences a share of the revenue from the ads paired with their videos. This can be lucrative for YouTubers with large followings. YouTube also reserves the right to \"demonetize\" either a single video or an entire channel if the content is not \"advertiser friendly\" - a second layer of content guidelines, above the ones that already apply to everyone. This means the revenue stream from a popular video can suddenly dry up at YouTube's discretion.</p><p>Having his entire channel demonetized could be a significant financial blow to Crowder, though he also sells merchandise and may have other sources of revenue, as well. I don't love that YouTube's revenue sharing only applies to YouTubers with a big audience. There's no reason why every user couldn't split ad revenue for their videos, however minuscule. But given that YouTube has chosen to reward audience size, it does create a useful distinction: It holds users with big audiences to a higher standard. Bigger audiences should mean higher standards.</p><p>YouTube may do this for its own financial reasons, of course: It wants this content to be palatable to advertisers. As we've learned, harassing speech has additional effects beyond just being hurtful. Crowder can say he's just debating, or being un-PC, that it's his right to speak as he chooses. But his audience takes these slurs as a signal to harass Maza directly: leaving cruel comments on his videos, harassing him on other platforms, emailing him with death threats. Crowder knows this, certainly. But he gets to shrug and pretend his words are the only issue. Having an audience comes with responsibility; YouTube's revenue-sharing rules, however self-interested, impose this additional responsibility almost by accident.</p><p>So, yes, YouTube absolutely does treat its stars differently. It's possible that, in a single policy decision like this one, star power counts for something, although YouTube said it didn't. But I think it's more about how YouTube is built, particularly around its distribution of money, where star power matters.</p><p>             HF: How much do political considerations (e.g., YouTube's relative sensitivities to criticism from liberals and criticism from conservatives) play a role?</p><p>             TG: There's certainly been an effort by the right to challenge the content-moderation efforts of YouTube and other social media platforms. Charges of bias against conservatives, based usually on a handful of examples and very little analysis, have even reached Congress and the Trump administration, which last week set up a site for lodging complaints of social media censorship. And progressives are making noise about regulating Big Tech for derelictions of public duty.</p><p>Crowder is now lodging the same complaints about conservative bias. It's a clever tactic; it's hard to imagine how the risk of looking biased wouldn't creep into YouTube's decision-making process. But I think it's a categorical error to always focus on individual bias without looking at the big picture. Sure, YouTube's content moderation team may hesitate about a decision that could look biased.</p><p>But the bigger issue is, how can a platform make fair decisions on a landscape of language that is itself political, politicized and shifting? Conservatives have spent the last few years suggesting that social media companies are liberal and biased; but they've spent the last few decades waging a protracted battle about political correctness, liberal bias in the news, campus speech and identity politics, painting all those concerned about rising hate and harassment as \"snowflakes,\" hurt by mere words. These tactics have pushed the U.S. political landscape about speech. So it's not just that YouTube has to decide whether this conservative blowhard is harassing or merely criticizing a liberal commentator at a progressive media site; it has to decide what even counts as harassment in the shifting sands of partisan language politics.</p><p>             HF: What recommendations does your book have for dealing with these kinds of clashes and controversies?</p><p>             TG: In \"Custodians of the Internet,\" I try to show what an enormously difficult task content moderation is, how it extends some very old questions we've had about media for a long time - and to wonder whether it's acceptable that these decisions should be made by the platforms. It's time for platforms to radically rethink their commitments and their impact on public life. They should certainly close the gap between their stated rules against harassment and actual enforcement of them. And they should admit that hateful speech stirs up swarms of harassers, by holding instigators as accountable as their followers. But they should also admit that all content moderation decisions are political and should not be exclusively in their hands. Publicly contested values are worked out by being publicly contested.</p><p>You could argue that this means Crowder should get to say what he wants, Maza what he wants, then we all gnash our teeth and beat our chests. But the alternative would be for platforms to make space for that debate to occur, publicly and among its users, and then enforce the conclusions they reach. It should matter what Maza thinks, what Crowder thinks, what I think and what all of us think - more so than what YouTube thinks.</p><p>                             Don't miss anything!

But long before it became fashionable to jeer Mark Zuckerberg, there was the Danish regulator, Margrethe Vestager. As the European commissioner of competition, a post she has held since 2014, she has fined Google billions for its bullying behavior toward rivals. Her investigations have shut down tax-avoidance schemes deployed by the likes of Apple and Amazon-and forced those companies to pay massive sums. Vestager is arguably the most important technocrat of the century.</p><p><br/>This October she will leave her post-and there's been talk of her ascending to an even more powerful position within European politics. But even Vestager concedes that her work has done little to diminish the power of Big Tech. Despite her efforts, 19 out of 20 European search-engine queries are still typed into Google. Based on her long experience tussling with these corporations, though, she has acquired a strong theory of how they can be tamed.<br/>Vestager is a figure of media fascination. She inspired the Danish television show <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgen_(TV_series)\">Borgen</url>. In interviews, she often knits while fielding questions with wry wit. Last week she visited Washington, and we spent an hour talking in her hotel suite. Her knitting needle didn't make an appearance. We discussed the power of Big Tech, the future of capitalism, and the perils facing the European Union. I condensed our conversation and edited it for clarity.<br/><br/>Franklin Foer: What about the trajectory of Big Tech causes you to lose the most sleep?<br/>Margrethe Vestager: Sorry, that's not a metaphor that works for me. To be at your best, you shouldn't ever lose sleep ... Now, the revolution that we're in-and we're definitely not anywhere near the end-it's changing everything. It's changing our democracy, our relationships, our society, and everything in the marketplace. What concerns me is that we have not fully started understanding, let alone clearly analyzing, what's happening. We just see it as a slow tsunami that is changing us, without being able to really fend for ourselves or give direction to our society.<br/>Foer: Doesn't that suggest a different approach to dealing with Big Tech? If we're merely reactive, couldn't the tsunami wash us across certain irreversible and perilous thresholds?<br/>Vestager: The same thing happened in other industrial revolutions. In the end, societies adjusted. They got control of working hours, child labor, harmful substances in the workplace. We are in the same process here. In Europe, we have the enforcement of the antitrust laws. And then we have all the regulation that gives direction to our society-data protection, digital citizen's rights, the copyright law just voted through in Parliament, and so on.<br/>Foer: In the United States, there's a surge of new concern about the problem of monopoly-and a rethinking of competition policy. Ever since the 1970s, the Chicago School and its economically minded view of antitrust has dominated. Everything has been about protecting \"consumer welfare,\" which really just means keeping prices low. But these companies deliver everything at extremely low cost, if not for free.<br/>Vestager: First of all, I'd never accept that they offer their services for free. It's complete fiction, so discard that. And the second thing is that I think it's important that you have a regulative framework that sets the direction. Take the safety of digital products. I think that it's kind of absurd that you're very, very careful with the substances in a feeding bottle and yet you just hand a toddler an iPad. That is very strange, because you have no idea of the effects of games played on an iPad, with the reactions of serotonin or adrenaline or whatever. Hundreds of questions have to be asked about the safety of digital products, just as we would regulate the safety of any other product that children would be exposed to. So you need to set up a framework for that outside of competition law and say, \"Well, this is how things will have to be done in our society. Within this framework, go compete.\"<br/>Foer: But part of the problem with, say, Google or Facebook or even Amazon is that they're gatekeepers for the flow of information. How can a government regulate that? I'd rather see government try to create a diverse marketplace than have government imposing standards for the dissemination of news.<br/>Vestager: I think that diversity is the most sustainable situation in any ecosystem. But the other thing, if you are a platform, you should have a number of obligations of transparency. People who depend on platforms constantly complain about them; we don't know what happened, we don't know why it happened, and we don't know who to turn to. You've got to be a really big fish to get one of these companies to pick up the phone and answer questions. They have to be more transparent-and there needs to be some arbitration mechanism, so there's someone to turn to. You can impose principles without going in and saying this is right and this is wrong.<br/>Foer: Since so much of Big Tech's power is invisible and it's not even clear that they always understand the way that it functions, or at least they always claim their algorithms are so complicated that they don't fully understand them ...<br/>Vestager: But that, I think, is another thing that you shouldn't accept: that this is just a black box and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. It doesn't make any sense. If it's your algorithm, it's your responsibility. This is the only way that we can sort of sustain a world where we know who is responsible for what.<br/>Foer: We know they have a pattern of recklessness. Yet with their algorithms, it's hard to establish fact patterns, to show cause and effect. I might have done something to offend, say, Amazon, and might be low in a search result. But why exactly did that happen? Were they punishing me? Or was the algorithm doing its job?<br/>Vestager: But this is why we are setting up our hardware so we can possess enormous amounts of data. This is why we specialize our staff to be able to do this kind of analysis. This is why we work with market participants-for instance, in the Amazon probe that we're doing right now, asking businesses and other stakeholders to provide us with data. That said, I think that reckless behavior, greed, power grabbing-when it comes to these motives, nothing is new.<br/>Foer: Kara Swisher       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2019/3/18/18270522/margrethe-vestager-europe-competition-commissioner-recode-decode-kara-swisher-podcast-interview-sxsw\">asked</url> you about Elizabeth Warren's plan for breaking up Big Tech, and you seemed hesitant. You don't think the companies have reached the point where that kind of invasive treatment is warranted?<br/>Vestager: My guess is Warren and I, we have, more or less, the same objective. So how to achieve that? Breaking up a company is a very far-reaching step. We have no experience of doing that in Europe. It's something that you've done here in the U.S. We've never done it. I'm told that we could do it. We would have a legal basis. But for us, it would be very far-reaching. Also, you could end up in sort of a Hydra ... isn't that when you cut off the head and suddenly more comes out? That you split up a company, but instead of just one giant, then you have four.<br/>Foer: But we were talking about diversity and pluralism. Having an oligopoly is still preferable to having a monopoly-at least those companies have some reason to compete to protect my privacy better or to supply me with information that better suits my needs.<br/>Vestager: But then it depends on how would you break them up. Would you say that shopping, local search, maps, should be independent companies? Should the search company be two, three different companies? And you would end up spending a decade-plus, if not two, in courts. And while you do that, the market moves on.<br/>Foer: With Big Tech, do you think that there are any signs that the market will move on? Do you see any hope that a competitive landscape could emerge?<br/>Vestager: No, not as such. But people are changing their perception of Facebook because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal-with people being more and more concerned about privacy. They're concerned about overwhelming power that they don't know how to control. Just five years ago, people thought, It's convenient. I'm fine. There is a new line of thinking emerging that a convenient life and a good life may not be the same thing. And that can carry change.<br/>Foer: So when I was recently in Denmark, your country, there was a sense of foreboding that Amazon is coming. It hasn't yet made a big push into that market, but it will. I sensed a desire to resist, but also resignation that Amazon would dominate the Danish market.<br/>Vestager: Yeah, but at the same time, the threat is providing a push for innovation. All of a sudden, you can have your groceries delivered again, which is something I remember from my childhood. That's a good thing. The second good thing is that people are reluctant because of the stories they hear about the working conditions of Amazon employees. It gets people really, really upset. We have such a long history of unions and employers cooperating to make sure of decent working conditions.<br/>Foer: Is there a doctrine to protect commerce and a way of life from the entry of a market participant that you know is going to be able to scale quickly and undercut everybody on cost?<br/>Vestager: I think it would vary from country to country. But you could use zoning restrictions to preserve inner-city business life. We have, in my own home country, very strict restrictions on malls. You'll find very few of them. So you have sort of a very strong preference for where to do business and the size of retail, so there's a limit as to, per square meter, how big a business can be. It's not hostile to foreign businesses. It's more a line of thinking that people should be able to do their groceries without having a car.<br/>Foer: Are you saying that antitrust is not the be-all and end-all of competition policy and the protection of markets? Maybe that's a very American way of thinking, and we should be thinking more expansively.<br/>Vestager: Well, I really don't know what you should do. But I know what we're trying to do. A diverse market is what drives innovation and quality, and serves the consumer. Of course, competition laws are well suited for that, and in Europe, it's a very strong tool. It's a big hammer, but that doesn't make everything a nail. This is why I mention to you these new pieces of regulation that are now being passed by our Parliament. You need competition law enforcement and regulatory rules. One cannot live without the other to achieve the aims that we have.<br/>Foer: When I went to Europe after the passage of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://eugdpr.org/\">General Data Protection Regulation</url>, I arrived with high hopes. But I found myself hugely disappointed. It seemed like I was still encouraged to surrender privacy. Opting out of data sharing was too complicated to quickly figure out.<br/>Vestager: I agree, but it's still early days. You have the regulation in place, but you need the market response, and you need the national regulators to be more vigilant. But I share your frustration. It's great to have rights, but it's even better to be able to exercise them. And a thing like ownership of data is a good thing, but I have no way to exercise my ownership. I have the frustration that if I disable cookies, then I have to redo my settings all the time. So I m hoping-and people are telling me it's coming-that you will be able to have an independent digital assistant that would know your privacy preferences and make sure that it's all set in that way, according to your preferences.<br/>Foer: Is that going to be provided by the market or by government?<br/>Vestager: Well, it could be provided by the market. I think that would be the fastest.<br/>Foer: How will Brexit reshape the political economy of the EU? Do you have concerns about the balance of power tilting more toward France and Germany, with their preference for industrial policy and the state championing industry?<br/>Vestager: There will be a void if the U.K. ever gets to leave. If you have a void, it will be filled. And what you see is that you have a number of smaller countries who are connected to both the single market and the global economy. They realize that you've had spectacular failures when politicians started deciding who should win in the marketplace. But the good thing about the debate we're having right now is that Europe can take a much more, how do you say, hard-nosed global position. When we ask for fair competition in the European market, we should also stand up for businesses in the global market. And we see a lot of unfair competition in the global market.<br/>Foer: As you've had this panoramic portrait of capitalism, really global capitalism at this moment, do you find yourself questioning some of the fundamental precepts of capitalism, or has your faith remained intact?<br/>Vestager: Economists have a lot of assumptions, and they truly are assumptions. When the internet got started, economists were very hopeful about the transparency it would provide, that you would have much more information about what goes on in the marketplace. Those hopes have been washed away. You don't get to have more insight, more information about how the market works as an individual customer. So there are shortcomings when it comes to capitalism. That being said, it's the least worst option. When the market serves the consumer, each and every one of us is empowered.<br/>It occurs to me, involved in government and politics for 30 years, in many different roles: While I may be starting my day with politics and ending my day with politics, the majority of other people couldn't care less. But even if they don't care at all, even if they don't even go to vote, they're still in the marketplace. And if you can make the marketplace work for them, that sort of empowerment might rub off on the rest of society, which is, of course, much more than the marketplace.<br/>Foer: The financial crisis, in addition to the heartache and pain it caused, also contributed to the loss of confidence in institutions and the loss of confidence in capitalism itself.<br/>Vestager: Yes. This is why it was important to bring cases against tax evaders. This rings a very, very strong chord in Europeans. [Because of tax avoidance,] they have seen that they themselves have to pay more and get less. Most smaller businesses pay their taxes. They work very hard to make a profit. And then they see giant companies and compete for the same capital, skilled workers, sometimes for customers. These get away almost scot-free. That is not acceptable from a competition point of view or from a fairness point of view.<br/>Foer: Yeah, we're tax-avoidance pioneers here. Take our president and his tax bill.<br/>Vestager: This is a very different country-you realize that. I've been coming to the U.S. for so long, and there are so many things I still don't understand.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-franklinfoerinterviewsmargrethevestager586573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTX-Y471-DYY9-J0MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

It's an interesting look at how she views the question of regulating internet platforms. Since this is a relatively long interview, we have broken it up into two parts, with the second part running tomorrow. Marietje Schaake is a leading and influential voice in Europe on digital platforms and the digital economy. </p><p>She is the founder of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda for Europe and has been a member of the European Parliament since 2009 representing the Dutch party D66 that is part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) political group. Schaake is spokesperson for the center/right group in the European Parliament on transatlantic trade and digital trade, and she is Vice-President of the European Parliament's US Delegation. She has for some time advocated more regulation and accountability of the digital platforms. Recently, I sat down with Marietje Schaake in a caf in the European Parliament in Brussels to talk about what's on the agenda in Europe when it comes to digital platforms and possible regulation. FR: Digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google have had a consistent message for European lawmakers: Regulation will stifle innovation. You have said that this is a losing strategy in Brussels. What do you mean by that? MS: I think it's safe to say that American big tech companies across the board have pushed back against regulation, and this approach is in line with the quasi- libertarian culture and outlook that we know well from Silicon Valley. It has benefited these companies that they have been free from regulation. They have been free not only from new regulation but also have had explicit exemptions from liability in both European and American law (Section 230 in the US and the Intermediary Liability Exemption in the E-commerce Directive in the EU). At the same time they have benefited from regulations like net neutrality and other safeguards in the law. We have been discussing many new initiatives here in the European Parliament including measures against copyright violations, terrorist content, hate speech, child pornography and other problems. digital platforms reaction to most of the initiatives has at been at best an offer to regulate themselves. They in effect say, \"We as a company will fix it, and please don't stifle innovation.\" This has been the consistent counter-argument against regulation. Another counter-argument has been that if Europe starts regulating digital platforms, then China will do the same. FR: You don't buy that argument? MS: Well, China does what it wants anyway. I think we have made a big mistake in the democratic world. The EU, the US and other liberal democracies have been so slow to create a rule-based system for the internet and for digital platforms. Since World War II, we in the West have developed a rules on trade, on human rights, on war and peace, and on the rule of law itself; not because we love rules in and by themselves, but because it has created a framework that protects our way of life. Rules mean fairness and a level playing field with regard to the things I just mentioned. But there has been a push-back against regulation and rules when it comes to digital platforms due to this libertarian spirit and argument about stifling innovation, this \"move fast and break things\" attitude that we know so well from Silicon Valley. This is problematic for two reasons. First, we now see a global competition between authoritarian regimes with a closed internet with no rule of law and democracies with an open internet with the rule of law. We have stood by and watched as China, the leading authoritarian regime, has offered its model to the world of a sovereign, fragmented internet. This alternative model stifles innovation, and if people are concerned about stifling innovation, they should take much more interest in fostering an internet governance model that beats the Chinese alternative. Second, because with the current law of the jungle on the internet, liberal democracy and democratic rights of people are suffering, because we have no accountability for the algorithms of digital platforms. At this point profit is much more important than the public good. FR: But you said that emphasizing innovation is a losing strategy here in Brussels. MS: I feel there is a big turning point happening as we speak. It is not only here in Brussels but even Americans are now advocating regulation. FR: Why? MS: They have seen the 2016 election in the US, they have seen conspiracy after conspiracy rising to the top ranks of searches, and it's just not sustainable. FR: What kind of regulation are you calling for and what regulation will there be political support for here in Brussels? MS: I believe that the e-commerce directive with the liability exemptions in the EU and Section 230 with similar exemptions in the US will come under pressure. It will be a huge game changer. FR: A game changer in what way? MS: I think there will be forms of liability for content. You can already see more active regulation in the German law and in the agreements between the EU- Commission and the companies) to take down content (the code of conduct on hate speech and disinformation). These companies cannot credibly say that they are not editing content. They are offering to edit content in order not to be regulated, so they are involved in taking down content. And their business model involves promoting or demoting content, so the whole idea that they would not be able to edit is actually not credible and factually incorrect. So regulation is coming, and I think it will cause an earthquake in the digital economy. You can already see the issues being raised in the public debate about more forceful competition requirements, whether emerging data sets should also be scrutinized in different ways, and net neutrality. We have had an important discussion about the right to privacy and data protection here in Europe. Of course, in Europe we have a right to privacy. The United States does not recognize such a right, but I think they will start to think more about it as a basic principle as well. FR: Why? MS: Because of the backlash they have seen. FR: Do you have scandals like Cambridge Analytica in mind? MS: Yes, but not only that one. Americans are as concerned about protection of children as Europeans are if not more. I think we might see a backlash against smart toys. Think about dolls that listen to your baby, capture its entire learning process, its voice, its first words, and then use that data for AI to activate toys. I am not sure American parents are willing accept this. The same with facial recognition. It's a new kind of technology that is becoming more sophisticated. Should it be banned? I have seen proposals to that end coming from California of all places. FR: Liability may involve a lot of things. What kind of liability is on the political menu of the European Union? Filtering technology or other tools? MS: Filtering is on the menu, but I would like to see it off the menu because automatic filtering is a real risk to freedom of expression, and it's not feasible for SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) so it only helps the big companies. We need to look at accountability of algorithms. If we know how they are built, and what could be their flaws or unintended consequences, then we will be able to set deadlines for companies to solve these problems. I think we will look much more at compliance deadlines than just methods. We already have principles in our laws like non-discrimination, fair competition, freedom of expression and access to information. They are not disputed, but some of these platforms are in fact discriminating. It has been documented that Amazon, the biggest tech company and the front runner of AI had a gender bias in favor of men in its AI-algorithm for hiring. I think future efforts will be directed toward the question of designing technology and fostering accountability for its outcomes. FR: Do you think the governments in the US and Europe are converging on these issues? MS: Yes. Liberal democracies need to protect themselves. Democracy is in decline for 13th year in a row (according to Freedom House). It's a nightmare, and it's something that we cannot think lightly about. Democracy is the best system in spite of all its flaws, it guarantees the freedoms of our people. It also can be improved by holding the use of power accountable through checks and balances and other means. FR: Shouldn't we be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water? We are only in the early stages of developing these technologies and businesses. Aren't you concerned that too much regulation will have unintended consequences? MS: I don't think there is a risk of too much regulation. There is a risk of poorly drafted regulation. We can already see some very grave consequences, and I don't want to wait until there are more. Instead, let's double down on principles that should apply in the digital world as they do in the physical world. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a truck company, a gas company or a tech company. I don't think any technology or AI should be allowed to disrupt fundamental principles and we should begin to address it. I believe such regulation would be in the companies' interest too because the trust of their customers is at stake. I don't think regulation is a goal in and by itself, but everything around us is regulated: the battery in your recording device, the coffee we just drank, the light bulbs here, the sprinkler system, the router on the ceiling, the plastic plants behind you so that if a child happens to eat it, it will not kill them as fast as it might without regulation, and the glass in the doors over there, so if it breaks it does so in a less harmful way and so on and so forth. There are all kinds of ideas behind regulation, and regulation is not an injustice to technology. If done well, regulation works as a safeguard of our rights and freedoms. And if it is bad, we have a system to change it. The status quo is unacceptable. We already have had manipulation of our democracies. We just learned that Facebook paid teenagers $20 to get to their most private information. I think that's criminal, and there should be accountability for that. We have data breach after data breach, we have conspiracy theories still rising to the top search at YouTube in spite of all their promises to do better. We have Facebook selling data without consent, we have absolutely incomprehensible terms of use and consent agreements, we have lack of oversight over who is paying for which messages, how the algorithms are pushing certain things up and other things down. It's not only about politics. Look at a public health issues like anti- vaccination hoaxes. Online sources say it is dangerous to vaccinate your child. People hear online that vaccinations are dangerous and do not vaccinate their children leading to a new outbreak of measles. My mother and sister are medical doctors, cancer specialists, and they have patients who have been online and studied what they should do to treat their cancer, and they get suggestions without any medical or scientific proof. People will not get the treatment that could save their lives. This touches upon many more issues than politics and democracy. FR: So you see here a conflict between Big Tech and democracy and freedom? MS: Between Big Tech with certain business models and democracy, yes. FR: Do you see any changes in the attitudes and behaviour of the tech companies? MS: Yes, it is changing, but it's too little, too late. I think there is more apologizing, and there is still the terminology, \"Oh we still have to learn everything, we are trying.\" But the question is, is that good enough? FR: It's not good enough for you? MS: It's not convincing. If you can make billions and billions tweeking your algorithm every day to sell ever more adds, but you claim that you are unable to determine when conspiracies or anti-vaccination messages rise to the top of your search. At one point I looked into search results on the Eurozone. I received 8 out of 10 results from one source, an English tabloid with a negative view of the Euro. How come? FR: Yes, how come, why should that be in the interest of the tech companies? MS: I don't think it's in their interest to change it, but it's in the interest of democracy. Their goal is to keep you online as long as possible, basically to get you hooked. If you are trying to sell television, you want people to watch a lot of television. I am not surprised by this. It was to be expected. However, it becomes a problem, when hundreds of millions of people only use a handful of these platforms for their information. It's remarkably easy for commercial or political purposes to influence people whether it's about anti-vaccination or politics. I understand from experts that the reward mechanism of the algorithm means that sensation sells more, and once you click on the first sensational message it pulls you in a certain direction where it becomes more and more sensational, and one sensation after another is being automatically presented to you. I say to the platforms, you are automatically suggesting more of the same. They say no, no, no, we just changed our algorithm. What does that mean to me? Am I supposed to blindly believe them? Or do I have a way of finding out? At this point I have no way of finding out, and even AI machine learning coders tell me that even they don't know what the algorithms will churn out at the end of the day. One aspect of AI is that the people who code don't know exactly what's going come out. I think it's too vague about safeguards, and clear that the impact is already quite significant. I don't pretend to know everything about how the systems work. We need to know more because it impacts so many people, and there is no precedent of any service or product that so many people use for such essential activities as accessing information about politics, public health and other things with no oversight. We need oversight to make sure that there are no excesses, that there is fairness, non- discrimination and free expression.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://amzn.to/2TNbFTG\">https://amzn.to/2TNbFTG</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=marietje+schaake\">https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=marietje+schaake</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120518/14001518975/european-parliament-member-marietje-schaakes-favorite-techdirt-posts-week.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120518/14001518975/european-parliament-member-marietje-schaakes-favorite-techdirt-posts-week.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT102305155060685330625176500164</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG3-39C1-JCMN-Y100-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2583\"/><timeReceived>8:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CATO INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is the second and final part of that conversation. FR: I want to focus on the small players. People concerned about regulation say that if you only focus on the big players like Facebook, Google or Twitter and how to regulate them, you will make it very difficult for the small players to stay in the market because transaction costs and other costs connected to regulation will kill the small companies. </p><p>Regulation becomes a way to lock in the existing regime and market shares because it takes so many resources and so much money to stay in the market and compete. And new companies will never be able to enter the market. What do say to that argument? MS: It depends on how the regulations are made but it is a real risk. It is the risk of GDPR[2] (general data protection regulation), and with filtering as suggested now. The size of a company is always a way to assess whether there is a problem, and I think we should do the same with these regulations so that there could be a progressive liability depending on how big the company is or there could be some kind of mechanism that would help small or medium size companies to deal with these requirements. Indeed, it is true that for companies that have billions of euros or dollars of revenue, it's easy to deploy lots of people. A representative of Google yesterday (at a conference in the European Parliament) said they have 10,000 people working on content moderation. Those are extraordinary figures, and they are proportionate because of the big the impact of these companies, but if you are a small company you may not be able to do it, and this is always an issue. It's not the first time we have been dealing with this. With every regulation the question is how hard it is for small and medium enterprises. FR: The challenge or threat from misinformation is also playing a big role in the debate about regulation and liability. We will soon have an election in Denmark. Sweden recently had an election where there was a big focus on misinformation, but it turns out that misinformation doesn't work as well in Denmark as in the US or some other countries because the public is more resilient. Why not focus more on resilience and less on regulation so people have a choice? We are up against human nature, these things are triggered by tribalism and other human characteristics. To counter it you need education, media pluralism, and so on. MS: I think you need to focus on both. First, what is choice if you have a few near monopolies dominating the market? Second, how much can we expect from citizens? If you look at the terms of service for a common digital provider that you and I use, they are quite lengthy. Is that a choice for a consumer? I think it's nonsense. That's one thing. Moreover, we are lucky because we are from countries where basic trust is relatively high, media pluralism exists, there are many political parties, and our governments will be committed to investing in education and media pluralism, knock on wood. How will this play out in a country like Italy where basic trust is lower and where there is less media pluralism, how are you ever going to overcome this with big tech, so I think there is a sufficient risk if you look at the entire European Union, Hungary and other countries, that governments will not commit resources to what is right and they will create the kind of resilience that our societies already have. In the Netherlands trust in the media is among the highest, and it's probably also because of a certain quality of life and certain kind of freedom that people have enjoyed for a long time. Even in our country you see a lot of anti-system political parties rise, so it's not a given that this balance will continue forever because it requires public resources to be spend on media and other factors. So I think both are very important and I don't want to suggest that we should not involve people but I don't know if we can expect of the average citizen to have the time and the ability to have access to information it would take to make them resilient enough on their own. FR: Do you think a version of the German \"Facebook law\" with the delegation of law enforcement to the digital platforms will make it to the agenda of lawmakers in the European Parliament? MS: No, I think there are too many flaws in it. It's bad. Some form of responsibility on behalf of companies to take down information will exist, but I hope the law will be the primary tool. The companies will take down content measured against the law with the proper safeguards and proportionality. If there are incentives like big fines to be overtly ambitious in taking down information, that's a risk. But on the other hand, the platforms as private companies already have all the freedom they want to take down any information with a reference to their terms of use. We are assuming that they are going to take the law as guidance, but nothing indicates they will. In fact, Facebook doesn't accept breastfeeding pictures, so they are already setting new social norms. A new generation may grow up thinking breastfeeding is obscene. The platforms are already regulating speech, and people who are scared about regulation should understand that it is Mark Zuckerberg who is regulating speech right now. FR: Recently the EU praised the Code of Conduct to fight hate speech online that they signed with the tech companies in 2016. A lot of speech has been taken down according to the EU: 89 percent of flagged content within 24 hours in the past year, but my question is: Do we know how much speech has been taken down that should not have been taken down? MS: No, we don't know. FR: That will concern those who value free speech. You have the law and you have community standards and then you have a mob mentality, i.e. the people who are complaining most and screaming louder will have their way and they will set the standards. So if you organize people to complain about certain content, it will be taken down to make life easier for Facebook and Twitter and Google. MS: Yes. FR: So you agree that it's a concern? MS: It's a huge concern. If you believe in freedom of expression which I know you do, and I think it's one of the most important rights and so many people have been fighting for it, why will we give it up? Just a little bit of erosion of freedom of expression is a huge danger and therefore to put responsibility on these companies to take down content without a check against the law is a risk, to allow these companies to set their own terms of use that can be at complete odds with the law and also with social norms (consider the restrictions on the breastfeeding, on Italian Renaissance statues as pornographic, or on the photo of a naked girl hit by napalm in Vietnam). Let me give you an example from my own experience. I gave a speech here in parliament, it was a very innocent and clearly political speech, but it was taken down by YouTube. They said it was marked as spam, which I don't believe. I have never posted anything that was labeled spam. What I think happened was that my speech was about banning goods and trade that can be used for torture and the death penalty. I think that the machine flagged torture because torture is bad, but a political debate about torture is not bad. I took a screenshot of the fact that YouTube took it down, posted it on twitter and said \"wow!, see what happened\", and they were on the phone within two hours, but that's not the experience most people (including the people I represent) will have. That's the danger. We also know examples of Russians having flagged Ukrainian websites and then they were taken down. And if that happens to a political candidate in the last 24 hours before an election it could be decisive, even if the companies say they'll restore it within 24 hours. FR: I spoke to a representative from one of the tech companies who said that when they consult with German lawyers whether something is legal or not, they will get three different answers from three different lawyers. He said that his company would be willing to do certain things on behalf of the government, but it requires clear rules and today the rules aren't clear. MS: Right, so now you see incentives coming from the companies as well. It's no longer working for them to take on all these responsibilities whether they are pushed to do so or just asked to do it. The fact that they have to do things is also a consequence of them saying \"don't regulate us, we can fix this.\" I think it's a slippery slope. I don't want to see privatized law enforcement. What if Facebook is bought by Alibaba tomorrow? How happy would we be? FR: I want to ask you about monopolies, competition and regulation. If you go back to 2007 MySpace was the biggest platform, then it was outcompeted by Facebook. As you say, there are concerns about the way Facebook manages our data and its business model with ads and sensational news driving traffic and getting more eyeballs. But why not let the market sort things out? If there is dissatisfaction with the way Facebook is running their business and our data, why not set up a competing company based on a different business model that will satisfy customers' need? MS: States don't built companies in Europe. FR: I was having private companies in mind. Netflix has a subscription model, wouldn't a digital platform like Facebook be able to do the same? MS: I think it would be difficult now, because there is a lock-in effect. In Europe we are trying to provide people with the ability to take their data out again. If you use gmail for 12 years, your pictures, your correspondence with your family and loved ones, with your boss and colleagues, it could all be in there, and you want to take all those data with you. It's your correspondence, it's private, you may need it for your personal records. You may have filed your taxes and saved your returns and receipts in the cloud. If you are not able to move that data to another place, then competition exist only in theory. Also, if you look at Facebook, almost everybody is on Facebook now. For somebody else to start from scratch and reach everybody is very difficult. It's not impossible but it's difficult. And for those models to make money the question is how much are customers willing to pay as required by the subscription model? Facebook and Google already have so much data about us. Even if I am not on Facebook, but all my friends are, then a sketch of my identity emerges because I am the empty spot between everybody else. If people start posting pictures of a birthday party with the 10 people who are on Facebook and the one person that is not, and then somebody says I can't wait to go on holiday with Marietje or whatever, then at some point it would be clear who I am, even if I am not on the platform, so they already know so much and they already has access to so much data about people's behaviour that effectively it will be very hard for any competitor to get close, and we have seen it in practice. Why hasn't there been more competition? FR: Do you compare notes with US lawmakers on this? And do you see that your positions are getting closer to one another? MS: Yes. FR: Can you say a bit more about that? MS: First of all the talk has changed. The Europeans were dismissed as being jealous of US companies and therefore proposing regulations, i.e. we were proposing regulations in order to destroy US competitors. I don't think that's true, but this stereotypical view has been widespread. Also, we were being accused of being too emotional about this, so we were dismissed as being irrational which is quite insulting, but not unusual when Americans look at Europeans. I think we are in a different place now with a privacy law in California, with New York Times editorials about the need for tougher competition regulations, with senators proposing more drastic measures, with organizations like the Center for Humane Technology focusing om time well spent, and with Apple hiring people to focus on privacy issues. Recall also conversations about inequality in San Francisco. We have a flow of topics and conversations that suggest that the excessive outcomes of this platform economy need boundaries. I think this has become more and more accepted. The election of Donald Trump was probably the tipping point. We learned later how Facebook and others had been manipulated. FR: You said that the problem with these companies is that they have become so powerful and therefore we need to regulate them. Is the line between public and private as blurred in Europe compared to the US? You focus on power no matter whether it's the government or a private company when it comes to protection of free speech, while in the US the First Amendment exclusively deals with the government. Do you see that as a fundamental distinction between Europe and the US? MS: There are more articulated limitations on speech in Europe: for example, Holocaust denial, hate speech and other forms of expression may be prohibited by law. I think there is another context here that matters. Americans in general trust private companies more than they trust the government, and in Europe roughly speaking it's the other way round, so intuitively most people in Europe would prefer safeguards coming from law than trusting the market to regulate itself. That might be more important than the line between private and public and the First Amendment compared to European free speech doctrine.Permalink[3] | Comments[4] | Email This Story[5] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-scaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11221841602/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-scaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-i.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-%0D%0Agdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-%0D%0Agdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml#comments</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190215/11321741603/conversation-with-eu-parliament-member-marietje-schaake-about-digital-platforms-regulation-part-ii.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051550693237969251763300043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG9-3N61-JCMN-Y2XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2451\"/><timeReceived>8:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CATO INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She is the founder of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda for Europe and has been a member of the European Parliament since 2009 representing the Dutch party D66 that is part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) political group. Schaake is spokesperson for the center/right group in the European Parliament on transatlantic trade and digital trade, and she is Vice-President of the European Parliament's US Delegation. She has for some time advocated more regulation and accountability of the digital platforms. </p><p>You can read Part 1 of this conversation here[1]. FR: I want to focus on the small players. People concerned about regulation say that if you only focus on the big players like Facebook, Google or Twitter and how to regulate them, you will make it very difficult for the small players to stay in the market because transaction costs and other costs connected to regulation will kill the small companies. Regulation becomes a way to lock in the existing regime and market shares because it takes so many resources and so much money to stay in the market and compete. And new companies will never be able to enter the market. What do say to that argument? MS: It depends on how the regulations are made but it is a real risk. It is the risk of GDPR (general data protection regulation,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018</url>[2] ), and with filtering as suggested now. The size of a company is always a way to assess whether there is a problem, and I think we should do the same with these regulations so that there could be a progressive liability depending on how big the company is or there could be some kind of mechanism that would help small or medium size companies to deal with these requirements. Indeed, it is true that for companies that have billions of euros or dollars of revenue, it's easy to deploy lots of people. A representative of Google yesterday (at a conference in the European Parliament) said they have 10.000 people working on content moderation. Those are extraordinary figures, and they are proportionate because of the big the impact of these companies, but if you are a small company you may not be able to do it, and this is always an issue. It's not the first time we have been dealing with this. With every regulation the question is how hard it is for small and medium enterprises.;  FR: The challenge or threat from misinformation is also playing a big role in the debate about regulation and liability. We will soon have an election in Denmark. Sweden recently had an election where there was a big focus on misinformation, but it turns out that misinformation doesn't work as well in Denmark as in the US or some other countries because the public is more resilient. Why not focus more on resilience and less on regulation so people have a choice? We are up against human nature, these things are triggered by tribalism and other human characteristics. To counter it you need education, media pluralism, and so on. MS: I think you need to focus on both. First, what is choice if you have a few near monopolies dominating the market? Second, how much can we expect from citizens? If you look at the terms of service for a common digital provider that you and I use, they are quite lengthy. Is that a choice for a consumer? I think it's nonsense. That's one thing. Moreover, we are lucky because we are from countries where basic trust is relatively high, media pluralism exists, there are many political parties, and our governments will be committed to investing in education and media pluralism, knock on wood. How will this play out in a country like Italy where basic trust is lower and where there is less media pluralism, how are ever going to overcome this with big tech, so I think there is a sufficient risk if you look at the entire European Union, Hungary and other countries, that governments will not commit resources to what is right and they will create the kind of resilience that our societies already have. In the Netherlands trust in the media is among the highest, and it's probably also because of a certain quality of life and certain kind of freedom that people have enjoyed for a long time. Even in our country you see a lot of anti-system political parties rise, so it's not a given that this balance will continue forever because it requires public resources to be spend on media and other factors. So I think both are very important and I don't want to suggest that we should not involve people but I don't know if we can expect of the average citizen to have the time and the ability to have access to information it would take to make them resilient enough on their own. FR: Do you think a version of the German 'Facebook law' with the delegation of law enforcement to the digital platforms will make it to the agenda of lawmakers in the European Parliament? MS: No, I think there are too many flaws in it. It's bad. Some form of responsibility on behalf of companies to take down information will exist, but I hope the law will be the primary tool. The companies will take down content measured against the law with the proper safeguards and proportionality. If there are incentives like big fines to be overtly ambitious in taking down information, that's a risk. But on the other hand, the platforms as private companies already have all the freedom they want to take down any information with a reference to their terms of use. We are assuming that they are going to take the law as guidance, but nothing indicates they will. In fact, Facebook doesn't accept breastfeeding pictures, so they are already setting new social norms. A new generation may grow up thinking breastfeeding is obscene. The platforms are already regulating speech, and people who are scared about regulation should understand that it is Mark Zuckerberg who is regulating speech right now. FR: Recently the EU praised the Code of Conduct to fight hate speech onlinethat they signed with the tech companies in 2016. A lot of speech has been taken down according to the EU: 89 percent of flagged content within 24 hours in the past year, but my question is: Do we know how much speech has been taken down that should not have been taken down? MS: No, we don't know. FR: That will concern those who value free speech. You have the law and you have community standards and then you have a mob mentality, i.e. the people who are complaining most and screaming louder will have their way and they will set the standards. So if you organize people to complain about certain content, it will be taken down to make life easier for Facebook and Twitter and Google. MS: Yes. FR: So you agree that it's a concern? MS: It's a huge concern. If you believe in freedom of expression which I know you do, and I think it's one of the most important rights and so many people have been fighting for it, why will we give it up? Just a little bit of erosion of freedom of expression is a huge danger and therefore to put responsibility on these companies to take down content without a check against the law is a risk, to allow these companies to set their own terms of use that can be at complete odds with the law and also with social norms (consider the restrictions on the breastfeeding, on Italian Renaissance statues as pornographic, or on the photo of a naked girl hit by napalm in Vietnam). Let me give you an example from my own experience. I gave a speech here in parliament, it was a very innocent and clearly political speech, but it was taken down by YouTube. They said it was marked as spam, which I don't believe. I have never posted anything that was labeled spam. What I think happened was that my speech was about banning goods and trade that can be used for torture and the death penalty. I think that the machine flagged torture because torture is bad, but a political debate about torture is not bad. I took a screenshot of the fact that YouTube took it down, posted it on twitter and said 'wow!, see what happened', and they were on the phone within two hours, but that's not the experience most people (including the people I represent) will have. That's the danger. We also know examples of Russians having flagged Ukrainian websites and then they were taken down. And if that happens to a political candidate in the last 24 hours before an election it could be decisive, even if the companies say they'll restore it within 24 hours. FR: I spoke to a representative from one of the tech companies who said that when they consult with German lawyers whether something is legal or not, they will get three different answers from three different lawyers. He said that his company would be willing to do certain things on behalf of the government, but it requires clear rules and today the rules aren't clear. MS: Right, so now you see incentives coming from the companies as well. It's no longer working for them to take on all these responsibilities whether they are pushed to do so or just asked to do it. The fact that they have to do things is also a consequence of them saying 'don't regulate us, we can fix this.' I think it's a slippery slope. I don't want to see privatized law enforcement. What if Facebook is bought by Alibaba tomorrow? How happy would we be? FR: I want to ask you about monopolies, competition and regulation. If you go back to 2007 MySpace was the biggest platform, then it was outcompeted by Facebook. As you say, there are concerns about the way Facebook manages our data and its business model with ads and sensational news driving traffic and getting more eyeballs. But why not let the market sort things out? If there is dissatisfaction with the way Facebook is running their business and our data, why not set up a competing company based on a different business model that will satisfy customers' need? MS: States don't built companies in Europe. FR: I was having private companies in mind. Netflix has a subscription model, wouldn't a digital platform like Facebook be able to do the same? MS: I think it would be difficult now, because there is a lock-in effect. In Europe we are trying to provide people with the ability to take their data out again. If you use gmail for 12 years, your pictures, your correspondance with your family and loved ones, with your boss and colleagues, it could all be in there, and you want to take all those data with you. It's your correspondence, it's private, you may need it for your personal records. You may have filed your taxes and saved your returns and receipts in the cloud. If you are not able to move that data to another place, then competition exist only in theory. Also, if you look at Facebook, almost everybody is on Fcebook now. For somebody else to start from scratch and reach everybody is very difficult. It's not impossible but it's difficult. And for those models to make money the question is how much are customers willing to pay as required by the subscription model? Facebook and Google already have so much data about us. Even if I am not on Facebook, but all my friends are, then a sketch of my identity emerges because I am the empty spot between everybody else. If people start posting pictures of a birthday party with the 10 people who are on Facebook and the one person that is not, and then somebody says I can't wait to go on holiday with Marietje or whatever, then at some point it would be clear who I am, even if I am not on the platform, so they already know so much and they already has access to so much data about people's behaviour that effectively it will be very hard for any competitor to get close, and we have seen it in practice. Why hasn't there been more competition? FR: Do you compare notes with US lawmakers on this? And do you see that your positions are getting closer to one another? MS: Yes. FR: Can you say a bit more about that? MS: First of all the talk has changed. The Europeans were dismissed as being jealous of US companies and therefore proposing regulations, i.e. we were proposing regulations in order to destroy US competitors. I don't think that's true, but this stereotypical view has been widespread. Also, we were being accused of being too emotional about this, so we were dismissed as being irrational which is quite insulting, but not unusual when Americans look at Europeans. I think we are in a different place now with a privacy law in California, with New York Times editorials about the need for tougher competition regulations, with senators proposing more drastic measures, with organizations like the Center for Humane Technology focusing om time well spent, and with Apple hiring people to focus on privacy issues. Recall also conversations about inequality in San Francisco. We have a flow of topics and conversations that suggest that the excessive outcomes of this platform economy need boundaries. I think this has become more and more accepted. The election of Donald Trump was probably the tipping point. We learned later how Facebook and others had been manipulated. FR: You said that the problem with these companies is that they have become so powerful and therefore we need to regulate them. Is the line between public and private is blurred in Europe compared to the US? You focus on power no matter whether it's the government or a private company when it comes to protection of free speech, while in the US the First Amendment exclusively deals with the government. Do you see that as a fundamental distinction between Europe and the US? MS: There are more articulated limitations on speech in Europe: for example, Holocaust denial, hate speech and other forms of expression may be prohibited by law. I think there is another context here that matters. Americans in general trust private companies more than they trust the government, and in Europe roughly speaking it's the other way round, so intuitively most people in Europe would prefer safeguards coming from law than trusting the market to regulate itself. That might be more important than the line between private and public and the First Amendment compared to European free speech doctrine.

She is the founder of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda for Europe and has been a member of the European Parliament since 2009 representing the Dutch party D66 that is part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) political group. Schaake is spokesperson for the center/right group in the European Parliament on transatlantic trade and digital trade, and she is Vice-President of the European Parliament's US Delegation. She has for some time advocated more regulation and accountability of the digital platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You can read Part 1 of this conversation here.</p><p>FR: I want to focus on the small players. People concerned about regulation say that if you only focus on the big players like Facebook, Google or Twitter and how to regulate them, you will make it very difficult for the small players to stay in the market because transaction costs and other costs connected to regulation will kill the small companies. Regulation becomes a way to lock in the existing regime and market shares because it takes so many resources and so much money to stay in the market and compete. And new companies will never be able to enter the market. What do say to that argument?</p><p>MS: It depends on how the regulations are made but it is a real risk. It is the risk of GDPR (general data protection regulation,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018</url> ), and with filtering as suggested now. The size of a company is always a way to assess whether there is a problem, and I think we should do the same with these regulations so that there could be a progressive liability depending on how big the company is or there could be some kind of mechanism that would help small or medium size companies to deal with these requirements. Indeed, it is true that for companies that have billions of euros or dollars of revenue, it's easy to deploy lots of people. A representative of Google yesterday (at a conference in the European Parliament) said they have 10.000 people working on content moderation. Those are extraordinary figures, and they are proportionate because of the big the impact of these companies, but if you are a small company you may not be able to do it, and this is always an issue. It's not the first time we have been dealing with this. With every regulation the question is how hard it is for small and medium enterprises.</p><p>FR: The challenge or threat from misinformation is also playing a big role in the debate about regulation and liability. We will soon have an election in Denmark. Sweden recently had an election where there was a big focus on misinformation, but it turns out that misinformation doesn't work as well in Denmark as in the US or some other countries because the public is more resilient. Why not focus more on resilience and less on regulation so people have a choice? We are up against human nature, these things are triggered by tribalism and other human characteristics. To counter it you need education, media pluralism, and so on.</p><p>MS: I think you need to focus on both. First, what is choice if you have a few near monopolies dominating the market? Second, how much can we expect from citizens? If you look at the terms of service for a common digital provider that you and I use, they are quite lengthy. Is that a choice for a consumer? I think it's nonsense. That's one thing. Moreover, we are lucky because we are from countries where basic trust is relatively high, media pluralism exists, there are many political parties, and our governments will be committed to investing in education and media pluralism, knock on wood. How will this play out in a country like Italy where basic trust is lower and where there is less media pluralism, how are ever going to overcome this with big tech, so I think there is a sufficient risk if you look at the entire European Union, Hungary and other countries, that governments will not commit resources to what is right and they will create the kind of resilience that our societies already have. In the Netherlands trust in the media is among the highest, and it's probably also because of a certain quality of life and certain kind of freedom that people have enjoyed for a long time. Even in our country you see a lot of anti-system political parties rise, so it's not a given that this balance will continue forever because it requires public resources to be spend on media and other factors. So I think both are very important and I don't want to suggest that we should not involve people but I don't know if we can expect of the average citizen to have the time and the ability to have access to information it would take to make them resilient enough on their own.</p><p>FR: Do you think a version of the German \"Facebook law\" with the delegation of law enforcement to the digital platforms will make it to the agenda of lawmakers in the European Parliament?</p><p>MS: No, I think there are too many flaws in it. It's bad. Some form of responsibility on behalf of companies to take down information will exist, but I hope the law will be the primary tool. The companies will take down content measured against the law with the proper safeguards and proportionality. If there are incentives like big fines to be overtly ambitious in taking down information, that's a risk. But on the other hand, the platforms as private companies already have all the freedom they want to take down any information with a reference to their terms of use. We are assuming that they are going to take the law as guidance, but nothing indicates they will. In fact, Facebook doesn't accept breastfeeding pictures, so they are already setting new social norms. A new generation may grow up thinking breastfeeding is obscene. The platforms are already regulating speech, and people who are scared about regulation should understand that it is Mark Zuckerberg who is regulating speech right now.</p><p>FR: Recently the EU praised the Code of Conduct to fight hate speech online that they signed with the tech companies in 2016. A lot of speech has been taken down according to the EU: 89 percent of flagged content within 24 hours in the past year, but my question is: Do we know how much speech has been taken down that should not have been taken down?</p><p>MS: No, we don't know.</p><p>FR: That will concern those who value free speech. You have the law and you have community standards and then you have a mob mentality, i.e. the people who are complaining most and screaming louder will have their way and they will set the standards. So if you organize people to complain about certain content, it will be taken down to make life easier for Facebook and Twitter and Google.</p><p>MS: Yes.</p><p>FR: So you agree that it's a concern?</p><p>MS: It's a huge concern. If you believe in freedom of expression which I know you do, and I think it's one of the most important rights and so many people have been fighting for it, why will we give it up? Just a little bit of erosion of freedom of expression is a huge danger and therefore to put responsibility on these companies to take down content without a check against the law is a risk, to allow these companies to set their own terms of use that can be at complete odds with the law and also with social norms (consider the restrictions on the breastfeeding, on Italian Renaissance statues as pornographic, or on the photo of a naked girl hit by napalm in Vietnam). Let me give you an example from my own experience.</p><p>I gave a speech here in parliament, it was a very innocent and clearly political speech, but it was taken down by YouTube. They said it was marked as spam, which I don't believe. I have never posted anything that was labeled spam. What I think happened was that my speech was about banning goods and trade that can be used for torture and the death penalty. I think that the machine flagged torture because torture is bad, but a political debate about torture is not bad. I took a screenshot of the fact that YouTube took it down, posted it on twitter and said \"wow!, see what happened\", and they were on the phone within two hours, but that's not the experience most people (including the people I represent) will have. That's the danger. We also know examples of Russians having flagged Ukrainian websites and then they were taken down. And if that happens to a political candidate in the last 24 hours before an election it could be decisive, even if the companies say they'll restore it within 24 hours.</p><p>FR: I spoke to a representative from one of the tech companies who said that when they consult with German lawyers whether something is legal or not, they will get three different answers from three different lawyers. He said that his company would be willing to do certain things on behalf of the government, but it requires clear rules and today the rules aren't clear.</p><p>MS: Right, so now you see incentives coming from the companies as well. It's no longer working for them to take on all these responsibilities whether they are pushed to do so or just asked to do it. The fact that they have to do things is also a consequence of them saying \"don't regulate us, we can fix this.\" I think it's a slippery slope. I don't want to see privatized law enforcement. What if Facebook is bought by Alibaba tomorrow? How happy would we be?</p><p>FR: I want to ask you about monopolies, competition and regulation. If you go back to 2007 MySpace was the biggest platform, then it was outcompeted by Facebook. As you say, there are concerns about the way Facebook manages our data and its business model with ads and sensational news driving traffic and getting more eyeballs. But why not let the market sort things out? If there is dissatisfaction with the way Facebook is running their business and our data, why not set up a competing company based on a different business model that will satisfy customers' need?</p><p>MS: States don't built companies in Europe.</p><p>FR: I was having private companies in mind. Netflix has a subscription model, wouldn't a digital platform like Facebook be able to do the same?</p><p>MS: I think it would be difficult now, because there is a lock-in effect. In Europe we are trying to provide people with the ability to take their data out again. If you use gmail for 12 years, your pictures, your correspondance with your family and loved ones, with your boss and colleagues, it could all be in there, and you want to take all those data with you. It's your correspondence, it's private, you may need it for your personal records. You may have filed your taxes and saved your returns and receipts in the cloud. If you are not able to move that data to another place, then competition exist only in theory. Also, if you look at Facebook, almost everybody is on Fcebook now. For somebody else to start from scratch and reach everybody is very difficult. It's not impossible but it's difficult. And for those models to make money the question is how much are customers willing to pay as required by the subscription model?</p><p>Facebook and Google already have so much data about us. Even if I am not on Facebook, but all my friends are, then a sketch of my identity emerges because I am the empty spot between everybody else. If people start posting pictures of a birthday party with the 10 people who are on Facebook and the one person that is not, and then somebody says I can't wait to go on holiday with Marietje or whatever, then at some point it would be clear who I am, even if I am not on the platform, so they already know so much and they already has access to so much data about people's behaviour that effectively it will be very hard for any competitor to get close, and we have seen it in practice. Why hasn't there been more competition?</p><p>FR: Do you compare notes with US lawmakers on this? And do you see that your positions are getting closer to one another?</p><p>MS: Yes.</p><p>FR: Can you say a bit more about that?</p><p>MS: First of all the talk has changed. The Europeans were dismissed as being jealous of US companies and therefore proposing regulations, i.e. we were proposing regulations in order to destroy US competitors. I don't think that's true, but this stereotypical view has been widespread. Also, we were being accused of being too emotional about this, so we were dismissed as being irrational which is quite insulting, but not unusual when Americans look at Europeans. I think we are in a different place now with a privacy law in California, with New York Times editorials about the need for tougher competition regulations, with senators proposing more drastic measures, with organizations like the Center for Humane Technology focusing om time well spent, and with Apple hiring people to focus on privacy issues. Recall also conversations about inequality in San Francisco. We have a flow of topics and conversations that suggest that the excessive outcomes of this platform economy need boundaries. I think this has become more and more accepted. The election of Donald Trump was probably the tipping point. We learned later how Facebook and others had been manipulated.</p><p>FR: You said that the problem with these companies is that they have become so powerful and therefore we need to regulate them. Is the line between public and private is blurred in Europe compared to the US? You focus on power no matter whether it's the government or a private company when it comes to protection of free speech, while in the US the First Amendment exclusively deals with the government. Do you see that as a fundamental distinction between Europe and the US?</p><p>MS: There are more articulated limitations on speech in Europe: for example, Holocaust denial, hate speech and other forms of expression may be prohibited by law. I think there is another context here that matters. Americans in general trust private companies more than they trust the government, and in Europe roughly speaking it's the other way round, so intuitively most people in Europe would prefer safeguards coming from law than trusting the market to regulate itself. That might be more important than the line between private and public and the First Amendment compared to European free speech doctrine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122728382</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGC-BRT1-JCBF-S0MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She is the founder of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda for Europe and has been a member of the European Parliament since 2009 representing the Dutch party D66 that is part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) political group. Schaake is spokesperson for the center/right group in the European Parliament on transatlantic trade and digital trade, and she is Vice-President of the European Parliament's US Delegation. She has for some time advocated more regulation and accountability of the digital platforms. </p><p>Recently, I sat down with Marietje Schaake in a caf in the European Parliament in Brussels to talk about what's on the agenda in Europe when it comes to digital platforms and possible regulation. FR: Digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google have had a consistent message for European lawmakers: Regulation will stifle innovation. You have said that this is a losing strategy in Brussels. What do you mean by that? MS: I think it's safe to say that American big tech companies across the board have pushed back against regulation, and this approach is in line with the quasi-libertarian culture and outlook that we know well from Silicon Valley. It has benefited these companies that they have been free from regulation. They have been free not only from new regulation but also have had explicit exemptions from liability in both European and American law (Section 230 in the U.S. and the Intermediary Liability Exemption in the E-commerce Directive in the EU). At the same time they have benefited from regulations like net neutrality and other safeguards in the law. We have been discussing many new initiatives here in the European Parliament including measures against copyright violations, terrorist content, hate speech, child pornography and other problems. Digital platforms' reaction to most of the initiatives has at been at best an offer to regulate themselves. They in effect say, 'We as a company will fix it, and please don't stifle innovation.' This has been the consistent counter-argument against regulation. Another counter-argument has been that if Europe starts regulating digital platforms, then China will do the same. FR: You don't buy that argument? MS: Well, China does what it wants anyway. I think we have made a big mistake in the democratic world. The EU, the U.S. and other liberal democracies have been so slow to create a rule-based system for the internet and for digital platforms. Since World War II, we in the West have developed a rules on trade, on human rights, on war and peace, and on the rule of law itself; not because we love rules in and by themselves, but because it has created a framework that protects our way of life. Rules mean fairness and a level playing field with regard to the things I just mentioned. But there has been a push-back against regulation and rules when it comes to digital platforms due to this libertarian spirit and argument about stifling innovation, this 'move fast and break things' attitude that we know so well from Silicon Valley. This is problematic for two reasons. First, we now see a global competition between authoritarian regimes with a closed internet with no rule of law and democracies with an open internet with the rule of law. We have stood by and watched as China, the leading authoritarian regime, has offered its model to the world of a sovereign, fragmented internet. This alternative model stifles innovation, and if people are concerned about stifling innovation, they should take much more interest in fostering an internet governance model that beats the Chinese alternative. Second, because with the current law of the jungle on the internet, liberal democracy and democratic rights of people are suffering, because we have no accountability for the algorithms of digital platforms. At this point profit is much more important than the public good. FR: But you said that emphasizing innovation is a losing strategy here in Brussels. MS: I feel there is a big turning point happening as we speak. It is not only here in Brussels, but even Americans are now advocating regulation. FR: Why? MS: They have seen the 2016 election in the U.S., they have seen conspiracy after conspiracy rising to the top ranks of searches, and it's just not sustainable. FR: What kind of regulation are you calling for and what regulation will there be political support for here in Brussels? MS: I believe that the e-commerce directive with the liability exemptions in the EU and Section 230 with similar exemptions in the U.S. will come under pressure. It will be a huge game changer. FR: A game changer in what way? MS: I think there will be forms of liability for content. You can already see more active regulation in the German law and in the agreements between the EU-Commission and the companies to take down content (the code of conduct on hate speech and disinformation). These companies cannot credibly say that they are not editing content. They are offering to edit content in order not to be regulated, so they are involved in taking down content. And their business model involves promoting or demoting content, so the whole idea that they would not be able to edit is actually not credible and factually incorrect. So regulation is coming, and I think it will cause an earthquake in the digital economy. You can already see the issues being raised in the public debate about more forceful competition requirements, whether emerging data sets should also be scrutinized in different ways, and net neutrality. We have had an important discussion about the right to privacy and data protection here in Europe. Of course, in Europe we have a right to privacy. The United States does not recognize such a right, but I think they will start to think more about it as a basic principle as well. FR: Why? MS: Because of the backlash they have seen. FR: Do you have scandals like Cambridge Analytica in mind? MS: Yes, but not only that one. Americans are as concerned about protection of children as Europeans are if not more. I think we might see a backlash against smart toys. Think about dolls that listen to your baby, capture its entire learning process, its voice, its first words, and then use that data for AI to activate toys. I am not sure American parents are willing accept this. The same with facial recognition. It's a new kind of technology that is becoming more sophisticated. Should it be banned? I have seen proposals to that end coming from California of all places. FR: Liability may involve a lot of things. What kind of liability is on the political menu of the European Union? Filtering technology or other tools? MS: Filtering is on the menu, but I would like to see it off the menu because automatic filtering is a real risk to freedom of expression, and it's not feasible for SME (Small and Medium Enterprises), so it only helps the big companies. We need to look at accountability of algorithms. If we know how they are built, and what could be their flaws or unintended consequences, then we will be able to set deadlines for companies to solve these problems. I think we will look much more at compliance deadlines than just methods. We already have principles in our laws like non-discrimination, fair competition, freedom of expression and access to information. They are not disputed, but some of these platforms are in fact discriminating. It has been documented that Amazon, the biggest tech company and the front runner of AI had a gender bias in favor of men in its AI-algorithm for hiring. I think future efforts will be directed toward the question of designing technology and fostering accountability for its outcomes. FR: Do you think the governments in the U.S. and Europe are converging on these issues? MS: Yes. Liberal democracies need to protect themselves. Democracy is in decline for the 13th year in a row (according to Freedom House). It's a nightmare, and it's something that we cannot think lightly about. Democracy is the best system; in spite of all its flaws, it guarantees the freedoms of our people. It also can be improved by holding the use of power accountable through checks and balances and other means. FR: Shouldn't we be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water? We are only in the early stages of developing these technologies and businesses. Aren't you concerned that too much regulation will have unintended consequences? MS: I don't think there is a risk of too much regulation. There is a risk of poorly drafted regulation. We can already see some very grave consequences, and I don't want to wait until there are more. Instead, let's double down on principles that should apply in the digital world as they do in the physical world. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a truck company, a gas company or a tech company. I don't think any technology or AI should be allowed to disrupt fundamental principles and we should begin to address it. I believe such regulation would be in the companies' interest too because the trust of their customers is at stake. I don't think regulation is a goal in and by itself, but everything around us is regulated: the battery in your recording device, the coffee we just drank, the light bulbs here, the sprinkler system, the router on the ceiling, the plastic plants behind you so that if a child happens to eat it, it will not kill them as fast as it might without regulation, and the glass in the doors over there, so if it breaks it does so in a less harmful way and so on and so forth. There are all kinds of ideas behind regulation, and regulation is not an injustice to technology. If done well, regulation works as a safeguard of our rights and freedoms. And if it is bad, we have a system to change it. The status quo is unacceptable. We already have had manipulation of our democracies. We just learned that Facebook paid teenagers $20 to get to their most private information. I think that's criminal, and there should be accountability for that. We have data breach after data breach, we have conspiracy theories still rising to the top search at YouTube in spite of all their promises to do better. We have Facebook selling data without consent, we have absolutely incomprehensible terms of use and consent agreements, we have lack of oversight over who is paying for which messages, how the algorithms are pushing certain things up and other things down. It's not only about politics. Look at a public health issues like anti-vaccination hoaxes. Online sources say it is dangerous to vaccinate your child. People hear online that vaccinations are dangerous and do not vaccinate their children leading to a new outbreak of measles. My mother and sister are medical doctors, cancer specialists, and they have patients who have been online and studied what they should do to treat their cancer, and they get suggestions without any medical or scientific proof. People will not get the treatment that could save their lives. This touches upon many more issues than politics and democracy. FR: So you see here a conflict between Big Tech and democracy and freedom? MS: Between Big Tech with certain business models and democracy, yes. FR: Do you see any changes in the attitudes and behavior of the tech companies? MS: Yes, it is changing, but it's too little, too late. I think there is more apologizing, and there is still the terminology, 'Oh we still have to learn everything, we are trying.' But the question is, is that good enough? FR: It's not good enough for you? MS: It's not convincing. If you can make billions and billions tweaking your algorithm every day to sell ever more ads, but you claim that you are unable to determine when conspiracies or anti-vaccination messages rise to the top of your search At one point I looked into search results on the Eurozone. I received 8 out of 10 results from one source, an English tabloid with a negative view of the Euro. How come? FR: Yes, how come, why should that be in the interest of the tech companies? MS: I don't think it's in their interest to change it, but it's in the interest of democracy. Their goal is to keep you online as long as possible, basically to get you hooked. If you are trying to sell television, you want people to watch a lot of television. I am not surprised by this. It was to be expected. However, it becomes a problem, when hundreds of millions of people only use a handful of these platforms for their information. It's remarkably easy for commercial or political purposes to influence people, whether it's about anti-vaccination or politics. I understand from experts that the reward mechanism of the algorithm means that sensation sells more, and once you click on the first sensational message it pulls you in a certain direction where it becomes more and more sensational, and one sensation after another is being automatically presented to you. I say to the platforms, you are automatically suggesting more of the same. They say no, no, no, we just changed our algorithm. What does that mean to me? Am I supposed to blindly believe them? Or do I have a way of finding out? At this point I have no way of finding out, and even AI machine learning coders tell me that even they don't know what the algorithms will churn out at the end of the day. One aspect of AI is that the people who code don't know exactly what's going come out. I think it's too vague about safeguards, and clear that the impact is already quite significant. I don't pretend to know everything about how the systems work. We need to know more because it impacts so many people, and there is no precedent of any service or product that so many people use for such essential activities as accessing information about politics, public health and other things with no oversight.

She is the founder of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda for Europe and has been a member of the European Parliament since 2009 representing the Dutch party D66 that is part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) political group. Schaake is spokesperson for the center/right group in the European Parliament on transatlantic trade and digital trade, and she is Vice-President of the European Parliament's US Delegation. She has for some time advocated more regulation and accountability of the digital platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, I sat down with Marietje Schaake in a cafe in the European Parliament in Brussels to talk about what's on the agenda in Europe when it comes to digital platforms and possible regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FR: Digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google have had a consistent message for European lawmakers: Regulation will stifle innovation. You have said that this is a losing strategy in Brussels. What do you mean by that?</p><p>MS: I think it's safe to say that American big tech companies across the board have pushed back against regulation, and this approach is in line with the quasi-libertarian culture and outlook that we know well from Silicon Valley. It has benefited these companies that they have been free from regulation. They have been free not only from new regulation but also have had explicit exemptions from liability in both European and American law (Section 230 in the U.S. and the Intermediary Liability Exemption in the E-commerce Directive in the EU). At the same time they have benefited from regulations like net neutrality and other safeguards in the law. We have been discussing many new initiatives here in the European Parliament including measures against copyright violations, terrorist content, hate speech, child pornography and other problems. Digital platforms' reaction to most of the initiatives has at been at best an offer to regulate themselves. They in effect say, \"We as a company will fix it, and please don't stifle innovation.\" This has been the consistent counter-argument against regulation. Another counter-argument has been that if Europe starts regulating digital platforms, then China will do the same.</p><p>FR: You don't buy that argument?</p><p>MS: Well, China does what it wants anyway. I think we have made a big mistake in the democratic world. The EU, the U.S. and other liberal democracies have been so slow to create a rule-based system for the internet and for digital platforms. Since World War II, we in the West have developed a rules on trade, on human rights, on war and peace, and on the rule of law itself; not because we love rules in and by themselves, but because it has created a framework that protects our way of life. Rules mean fairness and a level playing field with regard to the things I just mentioned. But there has been a push-back against regulation and rules when it comes to digital platforms due to this libertarian spirit and argument about stifling innovation, this \"move fast and break things\" attitude that we know so well from Silicon Valley.</p><p>This is problematic for two reasons. First, we now see a global competition between authoritarian regimes with a closed internet with no rule of law and democracies with an open internet with the rule of law. We have stood by and watched as China, the leading authoritarian regime, has offered its model to the world of a sovereign, fragmented internet. This alternative model stifles innovation, and if people are concerned about stifling innovation, they should take much more interest in fostering an internet governance model that beats the Chinese alternative. Second, because with the current law of the jungle on the internet, liberal democracy and democratic rights of people are suffering, because we have no accountability for the algorithms of digital platforms. At this point profit is much more important than the public good.</p><p>FR: But you said that emphasizing innovation is a losing strategy here in Brussels.</p><p>MS: I feel there is a big turning point happening as we speak. It is not only here in Brussels, but even Americans are now advocating regulation.</p><p>FR: Why?</p><p>MS: They have seen the 2016 election in the U.S., they have seen conspiracy after conspiracy rising to the top ranks of searches, and it's just not sustainable.</p><p>FR: What kind of regulation are you calling for and what regulation will there be political support for here in Brussels?</p><p>MS: I believe that the e-commerce directive with the liability exemptions in the EU and Section 230 with similar exemptions in the U.S. will come under pressure. It will be a huge game changer.</p><p>FR: A game changer in what way?</p><p>MS: I think there will be forms of liability for content. You can already see more active regulation in the German law and in the agreements between the EU-Commission and the companies to take down content (the code of conduct on hate speech and disinformation). These companies cannot credibly say that they are not editing content. They are offering to edit content in order not to be regulated, so they are involved in taking down content. And their business model involves promoting or demoting content, so the whole idea that they would not be able to edit is actually not credible and factually incorrect. So regulation is coming, and I think it will cause an earthquake in the digital economy. You can already see the issues being raised in the public debate about more forceful competition requirements, whether emerging data sets should also be scrutinized in different ways, and net neutrality. We have had an important discussion about the right to privacy and data protection here in Europe. Of course, in Europe we have a right to privacy. The United States does not recognize such a right, but I think they will start to think more about it as a basic principle as well.</p><p>FR: Why?</p><p>MS: Because of the backlash they have seen.</p><p>FR: Do you have scandals like Cambridge Analytica in mind?</p><p>MS: Yes, but not only that one. Americans are as concerned about protection of children as Europeans are if not more. I think we might see a backlash against smart toys. Think about dolls that listen to your baby, capture its entire learning process, its voice, its first words, and then use that data for AI to activate toys. I am not sure American parents are willing accept this. The same with facial recognition. It's a new kind of technology that is becoming more sophisticated. Should it be banned? I have seen proposals to that end coming from California of all places.</p><p>FR: Liability may involve a lot of things. What kind of liability is on the political menu of the European Union? Filtering technology or other tools?</p><p>MS: Filtering is on the menu, but I would like to see it off the menu because automatic filtering is a real risk to freedom of expression, and it's not feasible for SME (Small and Medium Enterprises), so it only helps the big companies. We need to look at accountability of algorithms. If we know how they are built, and what could be their flaws or unintended consequences, then we will be able to set deadlines for companies to solve these problems. I think we will look much more at compliance deadlines than just methods. We already have principles in our laws like non-discrimination, fair competition, freedom of expression and access to information. They are not disputed, but some of these platforms are in fact discriminating. It has been documented that Amazon, the biggest tech company and the front runner of AI had a gender bias in favor of men in its AI-algorithm for hiring. I think future efforts will be directed toward the question of designing technology and fostering accountability for its outcomes.</p><p>FR: Do you think the governments in the U.S. and Europe are converging on these issues?</p><p>MS: Yes. Liberal democracies need to protect themselves. Democracy is in decline for the 13th year in a row (according to Freedom House). It's a nightmare, and it's something that we cannot think lightly about. Democracy is the best system; in spite of all its flaws, it guarantees the freedoms of our people. It also can be improved by holding the use of power accountable through checks and balances and other means.</p><p>FR: Shouldn't we be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water? We are only in the early stages of developing these technologies and businesses. Aren't you concerned that too much regulation will have unintended consequences?</p><p>MS: I don't think there is a risk of too much regulation. There is a risk of poorly drafted regulation. We can already see some very grave consequences, and I don't want to wait until there are more. Instead, let's double down on principles that should apply in the digital world as they do in the physical world. It doesn't matter if we are talking about a truck company, a gas company or a tech company. I don't think any technology or AI should be allowed to disrupt fundamental principles and we should begin to address it. I believe such regulation would be in the companies' interest too because the trust of their customers is at stake. I don't think regulation is a goal in and by itself, but everything around us is regulated: the battery in your recording device, the coffee we just drank, the light bulbs here, the sprinkler system, the router on the ceiling, the plastic plants behind you so that if a child happens to eat it, it will not kill them as fast as it might without regulation, and the glass in the doors over there, so if it breaks it does so in a less harmful way and so on and so forth. There are all kinds of ideas behind regulation, and regulation is not an injustice to technology. If done well, regulation works as a safeguard of our rights and freedoms. And if it is bad, we have a system to change it.</p><p>The status quo is unacceptable. We already have had manipulation of our democracies. We just learned that Facebook paid teenagers $20 to get to their most private information. I think that's criminal, and there should be accountability for that. We have data breach after data breach, we have conspiracy theories still rising to the top search at YouTube in spite of all their promises to do better. We have Facebook selling data without consent, we have absolutely incomprehensible terms of use and consent agreements, we have lack of oversight over who is paying for which messages, how the algorithms are pushing certain things up and other things down. It's not only about politics. Look at a public health issues like anti-vaccination hoaxes. Online sources say it is dangerous to vaccinate your child. People hear online that vaccinations are dangerous and do not vaccinate their children leading to a new outbreak of measles. My mother and sister are medical doctors, cancer specialists, and they have patients who have been online and studied what they should do to treat their cancer, and they get suggestions without any medical or scientific proof. People will not get the treatment that could save their lives. This touches upon many more issues than politics and democracy.</p><p>FR: So you see here a conflict between Big Tech and democracy and freedom?</p><p>MS: Between Big Tech with certain business models and democracy, yes.</p><p>FR: Do you see any changes in the attitudes and behavior of the tech companies?</p><p>MS: Yes, it is changing, but it's too little, too late. I think there is more apologizing, and there is still the terminology, \"Oh we still have to learn everything, we are trying.\" But the question is, is that good enough?</p><p>FR: It's not good enough for you?</p><p>MS: It's not convincing. If you can make billions and billions tweaking your algorithm every day to sell ever more ads, but you claim that you are unable to determine when conspiracies or anti-vaccination messages rise to the top of your search At one point I looked into search results on the Eurozone. I received 8 out of 10 results from one source, an English tabloid with a negative view of the Euro. How come?</p><p>FR: Yes, how come, why should that be in the interest of the tech companies?</p><p>MS: I don't think it's in their interest to change it, but it's in the interest of democracy. Their goal is to keep you online as long as possible, basically to get you hooked. If you are trying to sell television, you want people to watch a lot of television. I am not surprised by this. It was to be expected. However, it becomes a problem, when hundreds of millions of people only use a handful of these platforms for their information. It's remarkably easy for commercial or political purposes to influence people, whether it's about anti-vaccination or politics. I understand from experts that the reward mechanism of the algorithm means that sensation sells more, and once you click on the first sensational message it pulls you in a certain direction where it becomes more and more sensational, and one sensation after another is being automatically presented to you.</p><p>I say to the platforms, you are automatically suggesting more of the same. They say no, no, no, we just changed our algorithm. What does that mean to me? Am I supposed to blindly believe them? Or do I have a way of finding out? At this point I have no way of finding out, and even AI machine learning coders tell me that even they don't know what the algorithms will churn out at the end of the day. One aspect of AI is that the people who code don't know exactly what's going come out.

Michael F. Bennet of Colorado came to The Post on Thursday to talk about why he is running for president and what he hopes to accomplish if elected. Here is the full transcript and audio recording of our conversation, which lasted a little more than an hour. We hope to host other candidates in the coming weeks and months.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             - Fred Hiatt, Editorial Page Editor          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Fred Hiatt: [00:02:36] So, thank you for coming. ... Maybe I could start by asking what you thought yesterday and where that leaves us in terms of the issues that were in the Mueller report.</p><p>             Sen. Michael F. Bennet: [00:03:15] I don't think it made a lot of news. It confirmed obviously that the Russian attack was real and serious. I've been collecting the slides from that Russian propaganda, from that attack. I've got them compiled on my desk - I meant to bring them with me, but I'll sent over to you later today. I think the American people still don't understand what happened to us in 2016, and they're going to try again in 2020. They're trying to do it throughout the Western democracies, and we need to be vigilant about that. I think that's a very important piece of this.Second -</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:03:55] If you were president, what more would we be doing to prepare?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:04:01] To prepare - I am on the Intelligence Committee and I can't talk about the intel, but I will say that I have a lot of confidence that our agencies are trying to withstand this attack in 2020, even if the president still won't push back on Putin, and has not pushed back on Putin, which I think a president should do. And I think we should be pushing back. Our allies in Europe want us to push back, as well, because their democracies are under threat for the same reason. I mean, the Russian support of these right-wing totalitarian parties in Europe I think is something we need to worry about. And we need to make clear that we're going to fight back against it, including sanctioning Russia for it, if that's what we need to do.</p><p>             [00:04:57] But I think we are in a much more aggressive position today than we were in 2016. In 2016, this Russian propaganda was part of our daily discourse for over a year. And we couldn't distinguish it from our own political discourse. And even today, people still send stuff around the country - I was in a senior citizens center in New Hampshire last weekend, and a guy who was probably 85 or 90 years old, at the end of it, said to me, \"I just think we should stop. We keep taking money from veterans and giving it to immigrants.\" Do remember that? Have you heard of that or seen that? That is Russian propaganda. That's from Russian propaganda. And that is infecting our political conversation, and nobody recognized it as Russian propaganda. That's where that comes from, that whole meme about [Barack] Obama -</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:06:01] So how are we better prepared now?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:06:05] Well, I think what we have to do is make sure, this is why I'm doing my part to put this sort of compilation of stuff together, so I can at least alert the people I work for that this is what you need to look for. And you need to recognize it for what it is. It's hard to have a president who's denying that an adversary is doing this kind of stuff.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:06:32] We'll probably come back to that, but you since you talked about New Hampshire, let's step back a little. Tell us, you've been running for a few months now; what surprised you and what do voters want to talk about most?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:06:47] I've been in the race I think for 80 days, and I got in a little late because I had some health issues that I had to deal with, which are fine now, but it slowed me down a little bit. We've used the 80 days well, I think. And what voters are talking about doesn't surprise me at all, because what the voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the Democratic folks that are showing up to these town halls, or in New Hampshire, the independents as well, are entirely consistent with what I hear from Democrats in Colorado. They're worried about an economy that grows only for the wealthiest people in the country. They want to have universal health care, but they don't think the path to universal health care is taking it away from 180 million people that get it from their employer in private insurance. They don't understand why we would do that. I met with some carpenters in Iowa the other day who said, \"Let me get this straight. You guys are saying Trump is trying to take away health care from the American people and that you're trying to give it to the American people, but from our perspective, you're the ones that are coming for our health care, not Donald Trump.\" This is a big problem for Democrats, in my opinion.</p><p>They're deeply concerned about climate and the fact that we have a climate denier in the White House. And the younger they are, the more concerned they are about that. And I would say their overarching concern is beating Donald Trump, which I think creates an opportunity to unite Democrats. I think that people are not as divided on the policy issues as one might imagine from reading the social media feeds that infect the capital.</p><p>             Ruth Marcus: [00:08:42] The candidates seem pretty divided on the policy issues. It seems -</p><p>             Bennet: [00:08:45] I think they are. I think they are. I think that we're in a place where there are people in this race who are responding to the Twitter base of the Democratic Party and not to the actual base of the Democratic Party. And they are distinct things.</p><p>             Marcus: [00:09:00] So you think that the Twitter base, as you call it, of the Democratic Party [has] been over-amplified or over-attended to? Or is there a real divide in the Democratic Party and a significant amount of energy on the left? What's your analysis?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:09:15] Well, I think among the people that I've talked to in these states, the desire to get rid of or the desire to beat Donald Trump is a far more animating factor than some dramatic move to the left. I think we will nominate somebody to the left of President Obama. And I think we should. But that doesn't mean we need -</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:09:44] Are you to the left of President Obama?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:09:46] I would put myself to the left of him. My evidence of that is the work that I've done for years with Sherrod Brown on the American Family Act, just to take that as an example, which is a dramatic increase to the child tax [credit]. Here, I brought some slides. I don't know if I want to take your time - do we have copies for these guys? But I wrote a book called \"The Land of Flickering Lights,\" which is not about me but about the democracy. And at the very end of it, I had a collection of slides about our economy, and I'll just leave them for you, but let me just tell you what they say, because I think it matters in the context, unless, were you going to say something?</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:10:30] We do want to talk about the economy, but when you say the desire to beat Trump is more uniting, but there is a division within the party also on what that means. And people on the left would say the way to beat Trump is to nominate somebody on the left who is exciting and gets new voters out, and that you don't represent that hook.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:10:56] I think that's a political analysis versus an ideological set of concerns.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:11:06] And what do you make of that analysis?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:11:08] I don't agree with it. I think that Donald Trump's base is going to be galvanized, and Donald Trump's base is going to turn out. And I think we need to galvanize our base and bring other voters to the polls for us to win. And we need the 7 million people that voted for Barack Obama twice and voted for Donald Trump to vote for the Democrat who is our nominee, or at least some portion of those people in order to win. That's what I think.</p><p>             Jo-Ann Armao: [00:11:39] Well if the animating force is a desire to beat Donald Trump, will that trump policy differences in the end?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:11:45] I think in the end, it'll bring the party together. But in the meantime, we can't disqualify ourselves on the way to the election.</p><p>             [00:11:53] I want to go back and just finish the thought and the American Family Act. So that's a dramatic increase the child tax credit. It would reduce childhood poverty in this country by almost 40 percent. It ends $2 a day poverty for kids in America - Princeton has looked at it and that's what they've said. It adds not a federal bureaucrat to the federal government. It is the most, I think, significant proposal that's been made on poverty since Medicaid was passed. That is to the left of Barack Obama, but it is not where Bernie Sanders is. It costs 3 percent of what Medicare-for-all costs, to reduce childhood poverty in America by 40 percent. That feels to me like something we can get done and that would be worthy of us. It's not the kind of thing that gets headlines all the time, but it is the kind of thing we can do. That's the bill that Sherrod Brown and I have had for years. It's a companion bill to what we're trying to do on the earned income tax credit. But I think that's a good illustration for what Democrats could do that could make a big difference if we weren't completely caught up in this health-care debate.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:13:04] In addition to people feeling as though Democrats are coming to take their health care away, are there other things you've heard from your opponents in the last 80 days that you would consider disqualifying on the way?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:13:16] I think that the idea that we would agree to decriminalize the southern border is one of those things. Our position is, in 2013, we passed a bipartisan bill, which was the Gang of Eight bill. I helped write, I was one of the four Democrats who wrote that bill. That bill created a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people here that were undocumented. It had the most progressive Dream Act that had ever been conceived. It resolved the agricultural issues that are plaguing this country in a way that allowed the farmworkers union and the growers in this country to endorse the bill. That had never happened before with an immigration bill. And it had $46 billion of border security in it. The original bill had something like $18 billion, and then we went to the floor, we ended up with $46 billion. It had 350 miles of border barrier, which the president refers to as steel slats. They've made up that term, I think, but the rest of us would call it a fence; 350 miles of that. We doubled the number of border security agents. We used drone technology and other technology so that you could see every single inch of the border. We had internal security. So we resolved the problem of, 40 percent of the people in the country that are undocumented came lawfully and overstayed their visas. And America has no way of solving that problem. We solved that problem in that bill. And every single Democrat voted for that bill in the Senate. So ever since then, when Donald Trump has said the Democrats are for open borders, that's a lie. It's not true. The border security in that bill is so much more extensive than what he has proposed with his ineffective law, that he's trying to, you know, nickel and dime everybody to get to scrape together his $6 billion to build, since the Mexicans have refused to pay for it. By the way, our bill, that money was paid for not by Mexico or by taxpayers, but by fees that immigrants were paying.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:15:30] But decriminalizing, why is that a mistake?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:15:34] But decriminalizing the border, I mean, [former homeland security secretary] Jeh Johnson wrote an op-ed - I think it was in your newspaper - that said that if what you wanted to do is inspire more and more people to come to the border, that's what you would do. And that every country in the world has the obligation to secure their border. I believe that. I think every country in the world, including the United States, has the obligation to secure their border. We have the obligation to treat refugees humanely. And we have the obligation not to separate children from their parents at the border. And we have the obligation to make sure that people get a speedy determination of their refugee status. But we don't have an obligation to have an open border. And as a political matter, that shouldn't be the position of the Democratic Party either, because Trump has continuously said that we're for open borders. That's not true.</p><p>             Lee Hockstader: [00:16:24] So, what would you do to revive an immigration deal? If you couldn't revive one, what would you do by executive action? And under what criteria would you deport people?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:16:34] By executive action, I would do everything I could to protect the dreamers, and I would do that on the first day.</p><p>             Hockstader: [00:16:44] Which would be what?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:16:46] I'm not sure what I would do, but I would do everything I could do to get them out of the jeopardy that Donald Trump has put them in. My priority for deporting people would be people that have committed serious felonies in the country and I'd place much less of a priority on people that hadn't. The basis I think for an agreement is the same bill that we had. We have two distinct issues going on here. One is the refugee crisis, which I think needs to be handled urgently and well and competently. I think the bill that we have in the Senate is a pretty good framework for that. In addition to that, we should be leading a conversation in the hemisphere about what to do with the refugees that are at our southern border but also coming. What can each country do to help with this? Because there are other countries that actually want people that speak Spanish and would like to have the labor that's represented there. I think we could say that we're gonna take some number of refugees and have the other countries take others, which would be helpful to lots of people, including the refugees. You can find lower-cost places to live in than the U.S. And obviously, we need to deal with the underlying problems in these countries.</p><p>             [00:18:14] I've been down to El Salvador and Honduras. I didn't go to Guatemala. But I went to look after 2014, when the unaccompanied minors came over this border, because I wanted to understand why a parent would place their child in the hands of a drug smuggler, spend a year's wages on a journey that could end up having them raped or killed or injured. And it took 15 minutes in the backyard of the embassy in San Salvador to understand it, because there is no rule of law. These kids are in constant - they're being being preyed upon by these gangs. And by the way, it has nothing to do with drugs; that's a common misconception. The drugs go around these countries. This is just poor people that are preying on other poor people. And surely we can help with that. I think we can help with that. By the way, the only place I've ever seen what I saw in San Salvador in America is on the West Side of Chicago, and we should talk about that if people are interested.</p><p>             Hockstader: [00:19:17] Just one more question on that. What would the Gang of Eight bill or anything like it do about catch and release - by catch and release, we mean as loopholes in the current law.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:19:26] I can't remember what we did in that bill.</p><p>             Hockstader: [00:19:29] How would you solve that problem? Because that's the current problem that's inducing a lot of people to come up, because they know that if they come with a child, they can be released in the United States for quite a long period.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:19:43] I think that we have to consider, our refugee laws were designed for one-off refugee applications, not for the kind of mass migration that we're seeing here - and not migration, but mass movement that we're seeing here. I think we need to think about what the right answer is for that. I think it's fair. We should not be making our immigration laws though based on this refugee crisis we've got. I think to answer your first question, I think the Gang of Eight bill still holds up. There's a lot in there that could form the basis of bipartisan action on immigration.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:20:15] Okay. So that raises the question of, is bipartisan action still possible in this country? I mean, in your book you talk about the Gang of Eight and Lindsey Graham is kind of a hero of it. A lot of people would say they don't recognize that Lindsey Graham anymore. But then it went to the House and Boehner went and broke it up, and the Republican Party has changed even since then. And your book talks about you can't have one party, one team ruling and have it be successful. But a lot of Democrats and a lot of Americans look at the Republican Party and say, \"How can you think they could be a partner in governing?\"</p><p>             Bennet: [00:21:07] This is really why I'm running. Because -</p><p>             Hiatt: Then I'm glad I asked.</p><p>             Bennet: It is, because in writing the book, and thinking about what was in the book and the last 10 years of American history, I'm so angry at the way that the Freedom Caucus and Mitch McConnell have immobilized our exercise in self-government. They have made it impossible for us to govern. They have acted as tyrants, as if they have a monopoly on wisdom. And their view of the world, no matter how it is idiosyncratic it is, no matter how much their version of American history owes its origins to Sarah Palin's cartoon version of what the Founding Fathers were engaged in, they have not compromised. And they're hypocrites on top of it, and they need to be beaten. They cannot be negotiated with. They cannot be compromised with, because they're immune from that. They will not negotiate. They will not compromise. So then the question is, what do you do about that?</p><p>             [00:22:23] And I think in a democracy, I think the only answer for that is to try to unify the country, or as much of the country as you can, to overcome them, to overcome a broken Washington, D.C. Washington's not going to fix itself. That's clear. And you're not gonna embarrass them into doing it.</p><p>             [00:22:43] Look at the stuff they're doing in this budget deal. It's the most pathetic, pitiful, disgraceful - after they call Barack Obama a Bolshevik and a socialist, they're now spending more on domestic discretionary spending than he did. Their increase in overall spending is greater than the increase that Barack Obama was able to spend, including the Recovery Act. And that's their whole rationale for being here. That was what the tri-corner hats were all about, the runaway spending, and all the signs. That's the whole purpose of their movement.</p><p>             [00:23:23] And they have done nothing but drive deficits up and drive government spending up. And if they're not even going to deal with that, they have no reason to be here. Because the only other things they're doing is taking away health care from the American people and denying that climate change is real. These people should be beaten on those terms. And I think the way we can do that is by creating a movement that unites enough people around the idea that we can't accept this degradation of our institutions, and of our exercise in self-government. And I think if we can't do that, we will be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity to people coming after us, not more. Ten years from now, we will. Ten years from now, we will. We are on that path today. And it's hard work. You can't do that just by going on MSNBC every night. You gotta go out to America and have a conversation with people who today don't support Democrats but whom you need to entrust themselves on some level to what we're offering.</p><p>             Karen Tumulty: [00:24:36] Sort of along those lines, I thought one of the underappreciated moments in the first debate, because Kamala Harris and busing got all the headlines, was when you kind of took the hide off Biden and essentially told him he'd been played for a sucker by Mitch McConnell in the budget deal. Why, if what the party wants more than anything else is somebody to beat Donald Trump, why isn't Biden that guy?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:25:04] Well, I think he fundamentally doesn't - first of all, I think there's a question whether he can beat Trump, based on his prior runs for the presidency. We'll see. But if history is a guide, there's a real question there, in terms of performance, over time during the presidential election. But on this point, I think he has made very clear that he believes that if we can just get rid of Trump, somehow things will go back to normal and we'll be able to make these bipartisan deals. And nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, they weren't able to do that during the last six years of the Obama administration, except when they cut terrible deals, like this, which was a terrible deal for America and a terrible deal for the Democratic Party.</p><p>             Tumulty: [00:25:51] Though Biden was bragging about it.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:25:52] He still is. That deal, in all respects, it was cut in the middle. First of all, Harry Reid was negotiating that deal and it got taken away from him. And,,and Biden was willing to do things that I don't think Harry would have been willing to do. We had the opportunity there to go over the fiscal cliff.</p><p>             [00:26:18] That was a rare opportunity during the course of the Obama presidency, because usually what you had on the backside of one of these things was a shutdown. This was not a shutdown. This was going over the cliff and having $4 trillion of tax increases, that then could have been converted into a Democratic proposal, that could have been a real middle-class tax cut and a real assistance to people living in poverty. And President Obama could have kept coming with that, and kept coming with that, that could have been our argument going into 2016.</p><p>             [00:26:52] Instead, what we had was virtually all of the Bush tax cuts, which you'll remember originally were created by reconciliation. So there is a 10-year window for those tax cuts. We should run against those tax cuts twice, and now we made them permanent. They weren't temporary. They're permanent, forever. Almost all of them. And then the sequester was part of that deal and that went into effect.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:27:24] Come back to your theory of change, because when people say to Bernie Sanders, \"How are you going to do all this?\" He says, \"Well, we need a revolution. We need to rise up.\" Sounds like you're kind of saying the same thing. If you got elected and Mitch McConnell is still majority leader, nothing's going to happen. So we need to have the people rise up and then, what, the Republican Party will transform itself?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:27:47] I don't know. I can't accept ... People might say that I'm naive for saying this, I think we will make a mistake if we accept the current national Republican Party as a permanent fixture of our democracy. If you are going to accept that if you're going to accept that as a permanent feature of our democracy, and we will be unable to overcome it. If that is what you accept, we're doomed. We are. And we're going to destroy our democracy. I don't accept that as permanent, because I don't believe that that's what the American people want. I live in a state is a third Democratic, a third independent, and third Republican. By the way, that makes it a state that's very different than almost all the people that are running for president. And I know that's not what people there believe. I know it's not what they believe. They don't share Mitch McConnell's view of the world. They don't share the view of the world of people that John Boehner called, \"legislative terrorists,\" which is how he referred to the Freedom Caucus that he couldn't overcome. They don't share that view. They have a different view. They also don't share Trump's view, many of them. And I think it's really critical for us not to accept this as a permanent state of things.</p><p>             [00:29:19] But we have to do the hard work. You can't put out a proposal that says you're going to take your health insurance away from 180 million people as your opening bid. You can't. You can't. It's disqualifying. If the object is to overcome the Republicans, rather than give Mitch McConnell talking points every single morning on the floor, about why the Democrats are Bolsheviks or socialists. Or why Republicans are trying to protect your health care, and Democrats are trying to take away from you. That's not a matter of, \"they're going to say it anyway.\" That's a matter of playing into their hands. I'll say one more thing, Ruth, and then I'll stop. We have a climate denier in the White House now. It should be disqualifying to deny that climate change is real. I don't mean that on moral terms, although I believe it on moral terms. I mean that on political terms. An American who says, \"I want to run for president and I don't believe climate change is real\" should lose on political terms. We lost to Donald Trump because he made an economic case that we were going to destroy the economy because we believe that climate change is real. When the reality is, if we don't contend with climate change, we will destroy the economy. We should never have lost that argument, and we shouldn't lose it again.</p><p>             [00:30:43] But if we're going to go to America and say our proposal on climate is that we have to give everybody Medicare-for-all and paid vacations, we're going to find ourselves losing on that issue again.</p><p>             [00:31:02] I'll tell you something else, what was not on that list of things that's in the deal, is a high-quality education for every kid in America. Which, which reminds me of why, I always, I bridle when people talk about how progressive they are and they can't remember what's happening to kids in America in our failing school system.</p><p>             Marcus: [00:31:26] This just goes to Fred's question about the theory of change. Because, yes, I get the point the Democrats shoot themselves in the foot. But we have heard throughout the Obama administration that the next election was going to break the fever.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:31:41] And it was wrong. That was totally wrong. He said that. President Obama, a lot of admiration for him, and a tremendous amount of respect for what he tried to do and what he did do. But we learned that . . . I'm trying to make your point. We learned something the fever did not break. We learned that Mitch McConnell is here to do two things: Put as many judges on the court as he can, and he, for the moment, has won that battle in ways that we should be very sorry that he did. In other words, he was very strategic about that. We were very non-strategic about that, and he won as a result. He wants to cut taxes for rich people and he's fine letting the Freedom Caucus dismantle the federal government. I'm not sure whether he cares about that or not, but he's fine allowing that to happen. He's fine degrading the reputation of Washington and the federal government along the way, which is also something that we've got to figure out a way to restore. The fever never broke. It's still here. It's just as strong as it always was, and the cynicism and the hypocrisy is even greater than anybody could have ever anticipated.</p><p>             [00:33:05] We have to learn from that though. And what we need to learn from that is, we have to do the hard work of going out and organizing America. That's why we have to do, and we have . . . And if we have to die trying. That is the work. It's going to be really, really hard. You can't do it. Look, if you had asked me 10 years ago who's running Washington, D.C., when I first got here, I would have had an answer. It would have been totally wrong. And if you'd asked me when I was chairing the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], who is running Washington, I would have had an answer, I would have been right and a lot of problems with that. Because it was interest groups in Washington, D.C., and to some extent, the Koch brothers. That's who is running to a greater and greater extent, the Koch brothers over that period of time. Now, who's running it is the cable-television channels and people who engage with their politicians on social media. So that's 12 or 13 million people whose equities are very well satisfied by what's going on in D.C. right now. They're extremely well satisfied. They're extremely well represented. They're never asked to sacrifice anything. And what they get is perpetual partisan warfare that the subject changes every day. Sometimes the subject changes every 15 minutes. And that frenzy is what we're all caught up in here.</p><p>             [00:34:32] But that's not going to make progress for the kids in the Denver public schools or their parents, ever. It's not going to make progress for people who live in rural communities, whose hospitals are closing. Ever. It won't. That's why I think we have to figure out how to overcome it. And I think we can only overcome it with a Democratic Party that can speak to America convincingly about getting some things done they care [about]. Which is really challenging, because it's not a fair fight. It turns out, it's much easier to create a constituency to break the government and to do nothing, than it is to create a constituency for change. That's really hard in a world of Fox News.</p><p>             Armao: [00:35:19] You mentioned education, and we wanted to ask you about that, because some of the positions that you've taken in the past are not seen as quote unquote progressive, or popular within the Democratic Party. Charter schools, you closed poor performing schools. Talk about that. And does that put you at a disadvantage?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:35:37] I don't think so because I think I'm where the base of the Democratic Party is on this issue.</p><p>             Armao: [00:35:43] The NAACP recently ...</p><p>             Bennet: [00:35:46] I disagree with their position. I'm sorry that we're on opposite sides of this issue because I obviously have a lot of respect for the organization, but I disagree with that position and I don't think the Democratic Party should be for a moratorium on charter schools. I don't believe the charter schools are the answer at scale. I never have believed that. I believe we've got to transform the system of public education that we have. We've had no economic mobility for 40 years and we've got the greatest income inequality that we've had since 1928.</p><p>             [00:36:25] And our system of education today is reinforcing that income inequality, not liberating people from it. Because the best predictor of the quality of the education you get is your parent's income. That line is to the point of ruthlessness. That line. Your parents' income determines your income. Your parents' income determines your education.</p><p>             Armao: [00:36:49] So how would you fix it? Because there's arguments that the reform movement: charter schools, No Child Left Behind, all of those things, the metrics, that didn't work, that failed.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:37:02] We certainly didn't make remotely the progress that we hoped that we would make. And I think across the country, and we've talked about this before, I think across the country, a lot of the efforts were failures because the implementation was so poor. There was a study that came out two weeks ago that Stanford did on the Denver Public Schools. It shows that the kids in Denver are growing so much faster than the rest of the kids in Colorado, that it is as if Denver Public Schools had 60 additional days of school a year for the past three years, compared to the other districts in my state.</p><p>             [00:37:49] That's progress, I would say. We still have massive achievement gaps in my city that I think about every day. So we have a long, long way to go.</p><p>             [00:38:04] The system belongs in the 19th century, that we have, and we need a 21st century system of public education in this country. There was a time, in the middle of the last century, when education transformed our economy and was the wind at our back. And today, as I said earlier, it's reinforcing all the inequities that exist in our country.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:38:26] So what can a president do?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:38:28] Well I think a president should convene the leadership across this country, including governors and school superintendents and mayors where that's important, and say,\" What is it we're going to do to create universal preschool in America?\" That's never going to be the federal government's job, but it is our job. We have to do it. If we don't have universal preschool in America, we're going to continue to have this problem. If we have schools, the quality of which are determined exclusively by the by the wealth of the neighborhood that they're in, we're going to continue to have these problems. Kids that go to college should be able to graduate from college debt-free. There's a lot a president can do about that, in terms of trying to incentivize universities to keep their prices low. By the way, this is another example of what's happened to us because our generation has been so unbelievably selfish compared to the next generation. Because what we decided was the easiest way to deal with this issue of rising costs of college and . . . in our failure and lack of responsibility to actually pay for public higher education, was to just let people take out student loans. Instead of doing something about it then, what Bernie proposes is, \"let's write off $1.6 trillion of student debt.\" Doesn't do anything about reducing the cost of college for anybody, talk about regressive, by the way.</p><p>             [00:39:50] I think my position on public education is progressive. I don't think it's the regressive position. I think when you are offering free college and you're offering debt repayment for wealthy kids in this country, that is regressive. When you are for universal preschool for Americans, that's progressive; when you are for focusing on the 70 percent of kids that don't go to college, that today America can only offer a minimum wage job to, and instead you want to reorganize high school and our community colleges, so that when they graduate from high school, they can earn a living wage. That alone would transform our economy. That's progressive. That's progressive. I'm not going to yield to anybody on that .</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:40:40] You keep speaking of the debt we're leaving the next generation, I think that's your opening.</p><p>             Charles Lane: [00:40:47] You've denounced this budget bill that they just came up with.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:40:50] Have I done that yet? I didn't know.</p><p>             Lane: [00:40:53] I read in your book some language about the dangers of deficits, but it seems like the reality, politically, in this country now, is that everybody in politics has decided to just pretend the deficit is not a problem.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:41:08] I agree, I agree.</p><p>             Lane: [00:41:09] But then again, there are some intelligent people who say, actually, it isn't a problem, and that's catching on in Democratic circles. So explain your view of why it's a problem, and two or three things you would do first to do it.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:41:22] Well, I think it's a problem because the only reason it doesn't seem like a problem right now is that interest rates are so low and they've stayed so low during these economic challenges that we've had. That's true. It's absolutely true. And if that continues to be true forever, I suppose, that one could say that it's not a problem. Having spent my life, or a part of my life . . . reorganizing distressed companies, I know that that kind of wishful thinking in the end, generally leads to disaster and that disaster is going to be if interest rates start to rise. I don't think you can bet on the interest rates not rising forever. I just think you can't. I think it's too risky and too careless. So that's one point.</p><p>             [00:42:20] The second point I'd make is, what have we spent the money on? And the answer to that is $5 trillion since 2001 on tax cuts for rich people, largely, tax cuts for rich people. And $5.6 trillion on the Middle East. Trump says it's $7 trillion, so that's $12 or $13 or $14 trillion that has produced the deficits that we have that have contributed to the deficit. From the point of view of the American people, we might as well have lit on fire. None of that money did anything to invest in the next generation of Americans. None of that money did anything to invest in our infrastructure. None of that money did anything to make Social Security solvent.</p><p>             [00:43:10] You could have fixed every bridge and every road in America, and every airport infrastructure project, every backlog that exists, given Wi-Fi to every rural community in America, made Social Security solvent for my children, and you'd still have money to pay down the deficit.</p><p>             [00:43:31] That's what we've been doing. So what I would do is stop doing that, for starters. And what I would do would be to reverse the Trump tax bill and do something that looked more like the proposals that I've made and that I'm running on, that were talked about earlier. There would be an actual investment in America, investment in infrastructure, investment in R&amp;D. This year, the Chinese for the first time are actually investing more money in R&amp;D than we are. Their curve looks like this.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:44:07] Was all the money spent in Afghanistan the equivalent of lighting it on fire?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:44:10] The money in Iraq and Afghanistan, from the point of view of driving economic growth in America? Yes.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:44:19] From the point of view of national security, shouldn't any money have been spent in Afghanistan?</p><p>             [00:44:24] I think that some money should have been spent in Afghanistan, but I don't think we should have fought a 20-year war there. I don't agree with that. I don't think we should have. I don't think the Israelis would have fought a 20-year war in Afghanistan. They would have done what they needed to do. And we should have done what we needed to do, but we shouldn't have been there for 20 years. And not just because it's $5.6 trillion, but because we shouldn't have young people there 20 years later.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:44:51] So if you inherit a situation like now, where there's some [10,000], 20,000 troops, and your generals say, \"pull them out, the Taliban and ISIS will come back. Keep them, Taliban and ISIS can be kept at bay, but not defeated.\" What do you do?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:45:12] I think that we need to draw down as far as we can, and still support the counterterrorism mission that we have there. That's what I think we should do.</p><p>             Lane: [00:45:24] Back to the economy, if you have that stack of slides there, but I I want to try out a sort of different kind of problem that the Democrats this year, which is the economy is a little too good for you politically. And obviously it'd be a lot easier to beat Trump if things weren't going so well. And I pulled a few statistics. So the [International Monetary Fund] has just raised its growth forecast for the United States for the next two years. Unemployment is down to 3.7 percent. According to the Atlanta Fed, wage growth is now at a 10-year high and returning to pre-recession levels. And I think that may reframe the challenge for your candidacy, in the sense that, maybe it's not about convincing people things are really bad, you've got the answer to them. But that things are going well, not necessarily because of Trump, and here's how I sustain all that. Because I do think going back, to your Carpenter's example, there may be some voters out there who feel like the Democrats will disrupt this good growth economy. So speak to that.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:46:33] Yes. . . . First of all, that wage growth is good news because we haven't had any for a long time. It's what you'd expect to see in the tenth year of an economic recovery. It's what you'd expect to see much earlier in the economic recovery than we've seen. And you know this is 2009 and this is today. Obviously, the line is effectively a straight line.</p><p>             [00:47:10] And, yes, Donald Trump's been president for these two years and that's what the line has looked like that and that's what we've continued to do. It's true. And this was a period of time that Donald Trump described as, \"American carnage.\" That's what he described this period of time.</p><p>             [00:47:32] The idea that this period is somehow all of a sudden not American carnage and this was, to me, doesn't hold up. You're right about the political argument that he'll make. And substantively, it doesn't support his argument that all of a sudden we should be euphoric about where this is. I think that's one point. Second, I live in a state with one of the best economies on the planet. and the vast majority of people I represent cannot afford housing. They cannot afford health care. They cannot afford higher education. They cannot afford early-childhood education. They cannot afford a middle-class life. That's not some people.</p><p>             Lane: [00:48:16] Excuse me, the vast majority?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:48:19] The vast majority. I pick my words carefully. A combination of housing, health care, higher education, early childhood. A combination of those things. And the people that don't come to my town halls, because they're working two and three jobs to try to get their family out of poverty feel like there's no escape from poverty no matter what they do.</p><p>             [00:48:43] And I know, this people not from my town hall, but from working for them when I was superintendent of Denver public schools. Now, just like I can't give Donald Trump, all the credit here. I can't give him all the blame for that, either. That's 40 years of America not responding to an economy that has benefited the people at the very top and nobody else. If you look at the slides that are in here, that's what you'll see. And that has continued under President Trump. And so we have to change that. We've got to invest in the economy in ways that will allow us to begin to grow for everybody again. And some people look at it, and say, well this is just what happens when you've got a worldwide market for labor. And when technology does what technology does. And there's been a rise in China. I think the American people look at Washington perpetually giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in the country, and spending all this money in the Middle East, and they say, \"it doesn't look like you've tried very hard.\" And they're right about that. And that's on both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>             Stephen Stromberg: [00:49:54] So on health care, you keep describing Medicare-for-all as taking health care away from 180 million people. Of course, Bernie Sanders have come back and say, \"we're not taking it away, we're giving them a plan that has less bureaucracy, that's more generous, has no co-pays, and isn't, more importantly, driven by a profit motive.\" Which, I think, he would say incentivizes treating people in a way that they would not want to be treated in health-care situations. So, how do you respond to that argument?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:50:33] First of all I think Bernie, unlike some other candidates, have been completely honest about what his plan does. And I give him credit for that, and I believe his ideological commitment to Medicare-for-all is consistent with everything that he has believed since 1973.</p><p>             [00:51:01] I also know that they passed a version of his bill in Vermont, and they could not get it done because Vermonters looked at what the taxes would be, that they would have to pay, which Bernie has at least been honest about saying it would be big taxes on the middle class as a part of his plan, and they rejected it. And there are many reasons why Vermont, I think I've read on the pages of this newspaper, there are many reasons why Vermont is actually the ideal place to have a single-payer system. And they couldn't get it done. It wasn't sort of rejected, it was completely rejected. Colorado voted 80 to 20 to reject a plan that was similar to it, and it couldn't get done in California.</p><p>             [00:51:51] So that's what I guess I would say, that, to the extent that Bernie says that all he's doing is swapping out private premiums for a big tax increase on the American people, I don't think that's something that the American people want. So I guess that's point one. Point two, I didn't say that he doesn't say that you ultimately will replace it, but he is taking away the choice that American people to be able to have private insurance if they want it or have a public option, which is what I support. And I think that's an enormous distinction in the approach to the work. And I don't actually accept that my plan is less progressive than Bernie's. No, I don't accept it.</p><p>             [00:52:39] I think my plan is much more likely to deliver universal health care than Bernie Sanders plan is. I do. And by the way, my plan, at least according to the CBO, when they scored it during the Obamacare debate, my plan doesn't cost $33 trillion. It actually nets out positively to the FISC.</p><p>             Molly Roberts: [00:53:08] To circle way back to the beginning and all that Russian propaganda. We have that, we have domestic misinformation on social media sites, hate speech. You've expressed some openness to what I think you've called \"rules of the road\" for these online sites. What would those look like, and how would they mesh with the country's free speech?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:53:27] I don't think it has anything to do with free speech. These companies are not the government. Or I should say, it doesn't mean any of the First Amendment. And I'm worried about them on a lot of levels.</p><p>             [00:53:40] This slide is the return on invested capital of publicly traded companies in America. The top slide are the most profitable companies, and then these are different quartiles of companies, and these are the big tech companies and the pharmaceutical companies in America.</p><p>             Hiatt: [00:54:04] By far the most profitable.</p><p>             Bennet: [00:54:05] By far. See how these lines are flat lines? That's what you would expect in a capitalist system that work. Because if you start to get an outsize profit, then someone else comes in and competes it down. Well, since about 1994, nobody's been able to come compete that down. So that's one point, I'm deeply worried about the antitrust implications of what's happening here and the distortion that that's causing.</p><p>             [00:54:35] Which I realize isn't your question, but I wanted to say that, when you got . . . whatever the advantages here, whether it's the fact that they've got more access to a greater amount of data than others, that they have a first-mover advantage that is puts them in a competitive advantage, or they're Amazon is a different example, but as Scott Galloway has said, when you're not expected to earn a profit, and you're out there buying grocery store chains, and everybody's market cap goes down by 20 percent, just because you said you're going to buy Whole Foods, which is the eighth-largest grocery chain in the country. Because grocery stores actually do have to earn a profit to survive and be rewarded in the public markets, we should be looking at this. And I think, they have acted, not Amazon but others, with respect to data, in a way that has to be regulated. I don't know the right way yet to do it. I'm not sure what the right way is. But I think Facebook, until very recently, what they were selling here was the idea that they were just sort of a benign platform misrepresents the effect that they've had our democracy and ignores the insidious nature of what has been trafficked, not just by the Russians, but by white supremacists and others. And I think they have a responsibility to the democracy, to the country that made them possible, to do a hell of a lot better job than they're doing, trying to ensure that my daughters and other kids aren't seeing people's heads chopped off.</p><p>             Roberts: [00:56:26] Should government be setting rules to make them do that?</p><p>             [00:56:28]          </p><p>             Bennet: [00:56:32] I think they should. I think they should. And if they do and it's sufficient, maybe government would - maybe there's less of a role for government. But to throw up your hands and say, well, you don't want the leadership of Facebook making these judgments, I disagree with that. We were attacked by a foreign government. Our democracy was attacked. Facebook claimed that the Russians weren't on their site. Facebook did nothing to protect America from the Russians. And if they were wrong . . . they were either wrong or they were lying about it. I don't know the answer to that. But it's intolerable. It's intolerable. If the Russians had you know given Walter Cronkite his evening script for a year, we would have done something about it. So, I think it's very serious. And obviously everything in America needs to be balanced and we need to have a vigorous public debate. I'm really worried. I'll invite you over to my office to read my Facebook page and, and as I said right in the book, I take it as part of my job as an elected official to take feedback on Facebook. But I guarantee you this, the vitriol that is on there is gonna do nothing to advance the interests of America. Nothing. And we have to figure out how to have a public conversation in America again. We are not Russia. We are not China. We are a democracy. We are a self-governing enterprise. We have to figure out how to overcome this.</p><p>             [00:58:30] There is no reason why social media should be an anti-democratic force. There is no reason it should be. I can imagine a world where it could be a powerful force for democratization. I could imagine it being a powerful force for democracy. But in the first two decades that it's been here, it has not. It is supported tyrants in the Middle East, not uprisings in the Middle East, in the end. And it has supported tyrants here that we now can't close over because of the insanity in our political system. So it is a huge, huge challenge that I hope the next generation of Americans are going to help us solve, because I think my generation on this, is fairly hopeless.</p><p>             Marcus: [00:59:18] Can I circle back to the news of the day, if that's alright? You've said that you wanted to wait to hear from Mueller from now on impeachment, so number one, what's your thinking about impeachment now? Number two, how should the next Justice Department think about whether to prosecute as Trump as Mueller testifed could be done. And number three, should the next Justice Department rethink the OLC opinion on whether presidents can be subject to indictment?</p><p>             Bennet: [00:59:49] I would say, on the first, I've said that I think that he committed impeachable offenses by obstructing justice. And we'll just have to see what Nancy Pelosi and the House decide to do.</p><p>             Marcus: [01:00:07] Well, you're running for president, what do you think should be done?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:00:14] I think that the House should pursue its oversight responsibilities. And I think they should allow that to lead them where they need to be. I don't think he should be impeached tomorrow. And I think that whatever we do, we need to approach this in a manner that makes it less likely, not more likely, that Donald Trump gets reelected. And I don't think that's an abandonment of our legislative responsibilities. I think that is a fundamental responsibility that we have to this democracy, is to make sure he's not reelected, and make sure that's not made easier for him to be reelected. And the answer to the other two questions is yes.</p><p>             Marcus: [01:00:55] [inaudible] the next Justice Department to think about? Do you think they should prosecute him?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:01:03] I think they should consider it. And I think that they should look at whether or not . . . I mean Mueller seemed to suggest yesterday that he could be prosecuted for what he's done. I think that it should be examined. I don't believe that we should turn the page on that, and on the last one, I think the OLC opinion should be reconsidered.</p><p>             Marcus: [01:01:24] Is it wrong?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:01:24] I don't know but I think it should be reconsidered.</p><p>             Lane: [01:01:26] I was just going to ask you if you think that AOC and the squad have proven a net plus or minus for your party, and generally how you view this latest episode.</p><p>             (Crosstalk)          </p><p>             Bennet: [01:01:49] She is an elected representative of her district as are the other members and they are entitled to do what they want to do. It's not her fault that the Democratic caucus in the Senate, for instance, doesn't have a climate plan, you know. And that there's a vacuum about what the Democratic Party stands for when it comes to climate change. That's not her fault. We should have a climate plan and we're working to try to develop one now. You know, we should have had one before.</p><p>             [01:02:28] I think what we've got is a place where nobody in America knows what the national Democratic Party stands for. And that's not acceptable. We need to stand for something that's coherent going into this election, if we're going to beat Donald Trump.</p><p>             Hiatt: [01:02:50] Can I just propose that we do climate, since you've been generous with your time? I'd like to let Steve do climate and we'd like as one District of Columbia related question, maybe a China question [inaudible].</p><p>             Stromberg: [01:03:12] Well what would you do on climate change?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:03:15] I would make sure that we did not lose the economic argument again to a climate denier. I'd make sure that we weren't beaten by a climate denier.</p><p>             [01:03:24] And my proposal is to spend a trillion dollars on climate technology to leverage another $10 trillion of private sector money, to make sure that America is exporting that technology around the world so that we're competing with China and others because I think that's a place where we can really lead. I've said that I think we can create 10 million climate jobs over the next 10 years, cut emissions in half by 2030, and in our buildings and in our transportation sector. And that we can be net neutral by 2050.</p><p>             [01:04:07] I agree with the findings of the Green New Deal. I agree with their findings and I don't think we should compromise on the science.</p><p>             Stromberg: [01:04:15] And a carbon tax or what mechanism would you do to drive down emissions?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:04:19] Well, one other thing that I write about in my plan is, I think we can use conservation to sequester carbon. So I think there's the opportunity for us to use the working lands in the United States, and public lands in the United States, to do that. And that is a way, also, of trying to engage farmers and ranchers in this work because we have to build a broader coalition than we have. You know, one of the things you hear people say all the time is, or climate advocates, is that we have to act urgently. I believe that, too. We have to acknowledge that this is something that I would do with executive orders.</p><p>             [01:05:08] But but we have to act urgently. But this is another place where if we accept their current political outcomes, we're doomed. Because you can't fix climate two years at a time. If you accept the politics, where this is all about putting in your policies for two years or four years, and having them ripped out by the other party the next two years or four years, you can't address climate change. You can't do it. You have to address it urgently, but you have to do it in a way that's durable.</p><p>             [01:05:39] You have to do it in a way that will last, like our foreign policy used to, for instance. It's not that it didn't change, but the broad contours of what we were trying to achieve were sustained from one administration to the next administration. It wasn't that long ago when that was true. Doesn't mean we didn't make mistakes, either. We did. But that is what's going to be required on climate. Which means we have to create a constituency in this country to do that. We don't have one today.</p><p>             [01:06:11] We don't have one that's broad enough yet today. So . . . my small way of trying to make an effort to do that is suggesting that conservation may be a way of doing it. I would support a price on carbon. I don't think that that is something that, in the near term, we could get through the Congress. But I think it's an efficient way to deal with this problem that has to be dealt with.</p><p>             [01:06:38] But when people say to me, you know, you're naive. I want to be clear about this, I want to be very clear about this: I am not saying that these guys, the Freedom Caucus and McConnell, are susceptible to negotiation. I don't. I do not agree with the vice president's view on that. By the way, we haven't even talked about the structural things that have happened over the last 10 years that were not even in place for 30 years, or whatever it was, that he was here as a senator. The attack on the Voting Rights Act - I shouldn't say attack, the demolition of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court's decision in [Shelby County v.] Holder, and effect of Citizens United, and the effect now of the actual gerrymandering that happened after the 2010 elections. Now, we have the knowledge that the Supreme Court has decided that's a political question that they can't deal with. And our Congress has been immobilized by Citizens United alone, I think. So these are the forces that were contending with on this stuff. And that we're going to have to address. But the point I'm making is, when people say I'm naive about that, what I say is you're naive to believe that if we keep doing what we've been doing for the last ten years, that our kids will have anything to thank us for. We're not going to be able to. I'm just being honest. I'm just being honest. We have to change our politics.</p><p>             Jackson Diehl: [01:08:24] You've said that Trump is right in putting pressure on China but he's going about it in exactly the wrong way, so I have two quick questions about that. Does that mean you're opposed to putting tariffs on Chinese imports? And you are opposed to the Commerce Department restricting the sales to Huawei?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:08:43] I think Huawei is a really serious problem for us. I think it's a real serious problem for the world. And I think the fact that Trump has been inconsistent on that, is damaging to us. And I think the fact that he retreated on what he was doing . . .</p><p>             Diehl: [01:09:00] Would you restrict the sales to Huawei?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:09:05] I would consider it. I think the biggest problem with Huawei is not the sales of our stuff to their network, but the proliferation of their network around the world. That's a big problem.</p><p>             [01:09:22] And it is a big problem. And for us to have inconsistent leadership on that, for us to back off on that at the first sign that Xi [Jinping] is upset with what we're doing, sends a terrible message.</p><p>             Diehl: [01:09:36] You're against tariffs?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:09:37] I think in general I am against tariffs. I wouldn't say that I would never employ them. But in general, I think they are a tax on our producers, they're a tax on our farmers and ranchers, and I think they're not the way to approach this.</p><p>             [01:09:56] On the other hand, there is an incredible opportunity here to mobilize the whole world. Because basically the entire world has the same interests that we do, vis a vis China, in terms of trade. I can only think of two exceptions: North Korea and Russia. And that's an amazing opportunity for us to show leadership after this administration is gone.</p><p>             Armao: [01:10:25] On D.C. statehood, now you and the other candidates support it. How would you achieve it? How big of a priority would it be? Or are there other things short of statehood that need to be done?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:10:34] What other things do you have in mind?</p><p>             Armao: [01:10:37] There was a plan several years ago, giving voting representation,a vote in Congress, perhaps one Senate vote, something short of statehood. Or are there other things? We've talked about a presidential commission to look at other aspects.</p><p>             Bennet: [01:10:52] I haven't studied the question but I think that people in this city should be enfranchised and should have representation in the Congress. I think that the fact that they don't is a legacy of decisions that were made 230 years ago that I think we should change. I as I understand it, I am the only candidate for president who has not said that I would change the filibuster rules to have a vote on D.C. statehood. And that is a position that I am holding. I don't understand that position. Do people think that Mitch McConnell couldn't change the rules tomorrow if he wanted to? If he wanted to give Utah an extra congressional seat? If he wanted to give Nevada an extra congressional seat? Yet, our position is we want to change these rules. We learned nothing from what we just went through on the judges. If you look at the map, it's gonna be very hard for us to win a majority in the Senate.</p><p>             [01:12:05] It's possible, it's possible . . . and I think it's possible if we're running on universal health care. I think it's impossible if we're running on Medicare-for-all. I think it's possible, if we're running on a climate change plan that excites America about the economic possibilities of doing that. I think it's impossible if we don't. But there are a lot of people who are saying the reason we should change the rules is because it's going to be very hard for us to have a legitimate majority.</p><p>             Armao: [01:12:37] So statehood won't happen?</p><p>             Bennet: [01:12:38] No, but I was making a different point, which is that has become what you're talking about has become a litmus test in the Democratic primary, where it is a litmus test that has nothing to do with the merits of statehood. It has nothing to do with your question, really. I'm sorry, but it just occurred to me. It has become a litmus test that plays into Mitch McConnell's hands. It's like he's sitting there with a fricking catcher's mitt, saying \"Please throw it in here again. Please throw it in here again.\" I don't know why we would do that.</p><p>             Hiatt: [01:13:15] Your book seems to suggest that you think if you're president and Mitch McConnell still the majority leader, you would not be able to get a Supreme Court justice approved.</p><p>             Bennet: [01:13:23] I don't think we would. And that's a tragedy and that - by the way, if people come in here and say to you that this was all inevitable, I totally disagree with that. This is a failure of leadership and a failure of imagination. And it is a failure of this generation of elected officials in Washington. And I've gone to the floor and apologized for my role in it. We've lost something. I went down on the floor to talk to McConnell about this. And to summarize, because I'll spare you the chapter and verse of this story that he told of us playing into his hands over and over and over again in ways that he could not believe. At the end, he said, \"But Michael, you shouldn't be so worried about this, because all I've done is put it back the way it was before you guys started to filibuster circuit-court judges in the early [1990s], Miguel Estrada and those others. I've just put it back the way it was because until then, nobody filibustered anybody.\" And I said, Mitch, that's not true. Because when I was in law school if you were qualified for the Supreme Court, you get 90 votes. You get 95 votes, if you were a circuit court judge. The same thing, and every time we had a vote like that, it reaffirmed the idea that the judiciary was independent of our, hopefully temporary, partisan insanity in the Senate. And we protected that for generations and generations and generations, and this generation of politicians decided not to live up to that. And, as a result, we have infected the courts with that partisanship and that is a loss for the American people. That is a shame. That is a loss for the American people. And it wasn't inevitable. We could have if we had had the stamina to do it, we could have headed it off with another Gang of 14 that said we're just not going to do this. If we give in to this, it's worth spending just a second on this, I think, if we give into this, if we decide that my position is naive and that what we have to do is accept a one-way ratchet-down that destroys our political institutions, that destroys our exercise and self-government, we will not sustain this democracy.</p><p>             [01:15:57] And that is really what I think is at stake in this election, much more than beating Donald Trump. That's what's really at stake. And for us to have a thriving democracy, we need to have a thriving economy that supports everybody in America, not just the richest people in this country. Not just the top 5 percent. The top 1 percent. And that's what we've known for four years. We can't do it for another 10 years. We're out of time. We are out of time.</p><p>             [01:16:33] Thank you.

Despite its myriad scandals - Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix - Facebook's reach continues to grow.</p><p>\"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes wrote. \"It is time to break up Facebook.\"</p><p>Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the Internet - as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Washington Post - was the only thing that would bring real accountability.</p><p>\"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet.\"</p><p>Hughes's call comes as Facebook faces yet another controversy: An investigation by the Associated Press revealed that the platform automatically generates videos and pages that elevate extremist groups.</p><p>The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth a half-trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes's estimates, Facebook commands \"more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue.\"</p><p>Hughes and Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook with Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz in 2004 while they were enrolled at Harvard University, an origin story famously chronicled in the Oscar-winning film, \"The Social Network.\" All are now billionaires save Hughes, whose fortune has been estimated at $430 million. </p><p>Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite movements like #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid. Many people eschew the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries. The apparent avalanche of disasters hasn't dented Facebook's finances; its earnings per share increased 40 percent last year.</p><p>\"Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,\" Hughes wrote. \"This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation.\"</p><p>No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it \"unprecedented and un-American.\" Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight over Facebook's algorithms, its privacy settings and community guidelines. He has the money and power to copy, buy or squash his competitors. Although Hughes defended Zuckerberg as a \"good, kind person,\" he cast him as a man hellbent on domination.</p><p>\"I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes wrote.</p><p>Facebook's monopoly is stifling innovation and economic growth, Hughes argued, citing the 20th-century breakups of Standard Oil and AT&amp;T by the Justice Department as examples of effective government intervention. The shift toward business-friendly policies in the ensuing years has eroded antitrust enforcement, Hughes wrote, at the expense of entrepreneurship, productivity and consumer health.</p><p>Hughes wants the government to correct the Federal Trade Commission's \"biggest mistake\" by forcing Instagram and WhatsApp to split from Facebook and become competitors again. He also wants the government to create an agency to regulate tech companies. Zuckerberg himself has publicly invited regulation, but Hughes maintains that the CEO is interested only in regulation that is \"friendly\" to Facebook.</p><p>\"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his op-ed. He also cited privacy, data protection and election integrity as other areas in need of government oversight.</p><p>Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made a case for federal intervention with Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made the breakup of American tech giants a pillar of her presidential campaign.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society &amp; our democracy,\" Warren said in a tweet Thursday. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has said he would hit tech companies with antitrust violations or fraud charges, arguing they unfairly censor right-leaning speech. This week, two top senators urged the FTC to go beyond its expected $5 billion fine against Facebook for its privacy practices, calling for tough punishments and accountability measures.</p><p>\"The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable,\" Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. \"The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:taylor.telford@washpost.com\">taylor.telford@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-ccfc7c02-7287-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2Y-0CP1-JBFW-C037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Met 2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Despite its myriad scandals - Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix - Facebook's reach continues to grow.</p><p>\"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive,\" Hughes wrote. \"It is time to break up Facebook.\"</p><p>Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the Internet - as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Washington Post - was the only thing that would bring real accountability.</p><p>\"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet.\"</p><p>Hughes's call comes as Facebook faces yet another controversy: An investigation by the Associated Press revealed that the platform automatically generates videos and pages that elevate extremist groups.</p><p>The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth a half-trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes's estimates, Facebook commands \"more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue.\"</p><p>Hughes and Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook with Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz in 2004 while they were enrolled at Harvard University, an origin story famously chronicled in the Oscar-winning film, \"The Social Network.\" All are now billionaires save Hughes, whose fortune has been estimated at $430 million. </p><p>Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite movements like #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid. Many people eschew the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries. The apparent avalanche of disasters hasn't dented Facebook's finances; its earnings per share increased 40 percent last year.</p><p>\"Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,\" Hughes wrote. \"This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation.\"</p><p>No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it \"unprecedented and un-American.\" Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight over Facebook's algorithms, its privacy settings and community guidelines. He has the money and power to copy, buy or squash his competitors. Although Hughes defended Zuckerberg as a \"good, kind person,\" he cast him as a man hellbent on domination.</p><p>\"I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,\" Hughes wrote.</p><p>Facebook's monopoly is stifling innovation and economic growth, Hughes argued, citing the 20th-century breakups of Standard Oil and AT&amp;T by the Justice Department as examples of effective government intervention. The shift toward business-friendly policies in the ensuing years has eroded antitrust enforcement, Hughes wrote, at the expense of entrepreneurship, productivity and consumer health.</p><p>Hughes wants the government to correct the Federal Trade Commission's \"biggest mistake\" by forcing Instagram and WhatsApp to split from Facebook and become competitors again. He also wants the government to create an agency to regulate tech companies. Zuckerberg himself has publicly invited regulation, but Hughes maintains that the CEO is interested only in regulation that is \"friendly\" to Facebook.</p><p>\"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his op-ed. He also cited privacy, data protection and election integrity as other areas in need of government oversight.</p><p>Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made a case for federal intervention with Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made the breakup of American tech giants a pillar of her presidential campaign.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society &amp; our democracy,\" Warren said in a tweet Thursday. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation.\"</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has said he would hit tech companies with antitrust violations or fraud charges, arguing they unfairly censor right-leaning speech. This week, two top senators urged the FTC to go beyond its expected $5 billion fine against Facebook for its privacy practices, calling for tough punishments and accountability measures.</p><p>\"The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable,\" Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. \"The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:taylor.telford@washpost.com\">taylor.telford@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ccfc7c02728711e99f065fc2ee80027a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-VCC1-DYX1-H037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>4:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Low-wage workers from other companies, including Instacart, Target, and Walmart, have gone on strike for similar reasons. Airbnb hosts are disgruntled that the platform they work for and lobby for is giving customers who cancel bookings full refunds, leaving hosts with no income and all the costs.</p><p>In moments of crisis, when new technology seems to offer quick and easy answers, it might appear difficult to devise an imaginative response to the large tech firms' growing power. But even though the litany of things that tech platforms get away with is quite remarkable, tools for fixing some of tech's deepest problems are closer at hand than one might think.</p><p>Companies on the internet can collect data about people's behavior in ways old phone companies and mail carriers never could: a telecom can't listen to your phone conversations and send you relevant robocalls. Ride-sharing apps got their start in part by bypassing regulations their taxicab competitors had to follow. Gig-economy platforms routinely claim the right to ignore hard-won labor protections on the grounds that they offer part-time freelance work, even though in many cases this work involves the kind of control over workers that is tantamount to standard employment.</p><p>There has long been a presumption in some quarters that the old rules don't apply to new tech. Earlier this year, before the virus set in, Michael O'Rielly, a commissioner at the US Federal Communications Commission, spoke at the university where I teach. He expressed his hope that with the days of \"circuitswitched copper networks\" behind us, the FCC's role would \"diminish exponentially,\" like \"a puff of smoke on a windy day.\" But we find ourselves in a moment when the companies the FCC regulates mediate more of our lives than ever before.</p><p>Indeed, many of the US's major antitrust laws were created for crises not so unlike the one we face today-times of super-powerful magnates and widespread economic upheaval.</p><p>These laws, crafted for the railroads and Standard Oil, empower regulators to, among other things, break up any company abusing its market dominance. Regulators have not recently exercised these powers against Big Tech because for decades they have narrowly fixated on consumer prices as the measure of whether a market is being monopolized-a measure that doesn't work for services, like Facebook and Google, that are free. This would change if regulators allowed themselves to see how far-reaching the old antitrust mandate against market manipulation really is. With many smaller businesses now on the brink of collapse, the danger of consolidation has never been greater. A moratorium on mergers is probably a necessary stopgap.</p><p>There's a similar story of amnesia in labor law. The gig-economy platforms have all but admitted that their business depends on systematically violating labor protections. California recently woke up to that fact, passing a law reclassifying many gig workers as employees. Especially now, when people with precarious incomes are risking their health by providing essential services from grocery delivery to elder care, they deserve every protection society can reasonably offer.</p><p>Regulations alone, however, are not enough. Policy should enable more than it prevents. In the 1920s and 1930s, US legislators put this principle into practice. Following the 1929 stock market crash, it was clear that banks were not accountable to their clients, and there were huge swaths of the country that banks didn't serve. In addition to new regulations that constrained the banks, the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act turned a few local experiments in community finance into a government-insured system. Member-owned, membergoverned credit unions proliferated. They held banks to higher standards and brought financial services to places where there had been none.</p><p>In similar fashion, two years later, the Rural Electrification Act helped bring electricity to farm country, where investorowned utilities hadn't bothered to string lines. Low-interest loans through the Department of Agriculture enabled communities to organize cooperatives- nearly 900 of which still operate today. The loan program now earns more than it costs. Like the housing policies of the time that gave us the 30-year mortgage, it was a public policy that enabled widespread private ownership.</p><p>These were some of the most powerful economic development programs in US history. They introduced dynamism and decentralization to markets in danger of being held in thrall to monopoly and exploitation. If we want a more inclusive tech economy, the New Deal legacy would be a good place to start.</p><p>Internet users need the capacity to form cooperative alternatives to the dominant platforms and infrastructure. For instance, much the same model as that of the cooperative electric companies could be used to bring customer-owned broadband to underserved communities. Some old rural electric co-ops are offering fiber-to-thehome already.</p><p>Furthermore, gig workers and customers who rely on them currently have to use investor-owned platforms. But one proposed bill in California, the Cooperative Economy Act, would enable platform workers to organize co-ops that could collectively negotiate with platforms-and perhaps even build platforms of their own. This would enable these workers, many of whom are now essential as drivers and delivery people, to obtain better wages and working conditions.</p><p>Quarantine and remote work also leave many people more dependent than ever on communication platforms, which typically collect personal data for uncertain purposes. This shouldn't be a necessary tradeoff. Using free, open-source tools like NextCloud for file-sharing and Jitsi for videoconferencing, groups can manage their own privacy-protecting systems and decide for themselves how their data is used. Public investment in projects like this could ensure that, as with credit unions, people have the means to organize alternatives when the big platforms aren't meeting their needs or respecting their values.</p><p>The internet may have near-magical powers that can help us get through the coronavirus crisis, but making technology firms accountable can begin with lessons learned from the last depression. Good tech policy requires recognizing that tech is just another way of wielding power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECRVW-2436362315</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECRVWJuly 2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-FTM1-JBHT-D3KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381140</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright July 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright July 2020 Technology Review, Inc.

Buoyed by taxpayer-financed bailouts, banks recovered and business at most institutions stabilized. But if there is one lingering casualty of that era, it is the erosion of public trust in the financial sector . Ten years after the crisis began, Main Street still has little faith in Wall Street. A similar crisis of confidence plagues the technology industry today. </p><p>As executives at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica rationalize their companies' use and abuse of personal data , trust in technology firms is approaching a tipping point. 'Big Tech' can still salvage its reputation, but its most powerful companies will need to change fundamentally how they operate. And to do that, they must avoid the mistakes that nearly crippled the financial sector a decade ago. The daily Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Five key lessons from the financial crisis should guide decision-making in the tech sector today. First, consumer illiteracy can be costly. Shortly before the housing bubble burst in the US, many investors realized they had no understanding of the products they were buying; some didn't even know they were buying anything. Financial journalism contributed to this atmosphere of ignorance by focusing only on the potential gains, and ignoring the risks. People engage with technology in similar ways. Companies, governments and businesses happily plug their entire operations into platforms they cannot control. Doubt, if it does arise, is usually subdued, because the technology is too convenient to abandon. But just like perilous financial products, the only way to mitigate the risks of new technologies is to be fully educated about what could go wrong. The second lesson is that hidden costs add up. Before the financial crisis, many Americans were sold products with undisclosed fees and financial add-ons that became massive liabilities. Today, more investors recognize that higher returns imply higher risk, but in the technology business, hidden costs continue to entrap unsuspecting consumers. Some of these costs are social - like being pressured by advertisers to buy products. And others are more tangible, like giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service. Third, inequitable pay and incentive structures are bad for business. Much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis. But the chief executives of Silicon Valley are no Robin Hoods either. Tech entrepreneurs might tell their investors they want to change the world, but many are intoxicated by the idea that the world will be better when they sell their business to the highest bidder. Fourth, businesses that are male-dominated take more unnecessary risks. When the history of the financial crisis was being written, many argued that greater gender diversity would have mitigated the damage. In 2010, two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister, quipped that the crisis would have been less painful if 'Lehman Sisters' had been managing the store. The same logic applies to the tech sector today. Finally, as we learned a decade ago, the global economy is deeply interconnected; no bank was too big to fail or to be rescued. This is true for the largest technology companies as well. The collapse of Amazon or Google - however invulnerable they may seem - would have devastating ripple effects. While many argue that it would be unwise to regulate technology firms with a view to concerns over censorship and access to knowledge, these companies, like their financial-sector counterparts, have grown too big to be left to their own devices. In the decade since the financial crisis erupted, structural changes have helped stabilize the banking and financial-services industry. Regulations have increased transparency and improved consumer awareness. But the old dynamics, power structures, and bloated pay scales have largely survived. As a result, the sector's reputation remains in tatters. For the technology industry to avoid a similar fate, its leaders must increase consumers' literacy about the products they offer - and the potential dangers they hold. CEOs must support regulation, increase workplace diversity, and make compensation and incentive structures more equitable. Above all, tech leaders should avoid the mistakes made by other industries navigating crisis. And no industry offers a more relevant case study than the one that almost took down the global economy.

He was 74.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Vajna, who produced many other films, died Sunday at his Budapest home after a long illness, Hungary\u2019s National Film Fund said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Schwarzenegger remembered Vajna as \u201ca dear friend and a revolutionary force in Hollywood.\u201d</p><p> \u201cHe proved that you don\u2019t need studios to make huge movies,\u201d Schwarzenegger posted on Twitter. \u201cHe had a huge heart, and he was one of the most generous guys around. I\u2019ll miss him.\u201d</p><p> Stallone paid tribute to Vajna on Instagram, calling him \u201ca pioneer\u201d and \u201cthe man that made Rambo\u201d happen. Vajna believed in \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d the first Rambo film, \u201cwhen no one else did. This truly breaks my heart,\u201d Stallone said.</p><p> Vajna was also owner of the TV2 Group, a Hungarian company which owns several television channels, including TV2, one of Hungary\u2019s two main broadcasters and politically aligned closely with Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s government.</p><p> \u201cWe are bidding farewell to the greatest Hungarian film producer,\u201d Orban posted on his Facebook page. \u201cHasta la vista, Andy! Thank you for everything, my friend!\u201d</p><p> Since 2011, Vajna had been a commissioner in the Orban government, in charge of developing Hungary\u2019s film industry.</p><p> Hungarian films have won several top prizes at recent international festivals. In 2016, \u201cSon of Saul,\u201d financed mostly by Hungary\u2019s National Film Fund, won the Oscar for best foreign language film.</p><p> Vajna, who enjoyed a state-granted monopolistic concession on Budapest casinos, was recently listed by the Hungarian edition of Forbes magazine as the 18th richest Hungarian, with a net worth estimated at nearly $240 million. He also owned Radio 1, a radio station popular across the country.</p><p> The producer was born Andras Gyorgy Vajna in Budapest on Aug. 1, 1944, and escaped Hungary\u2019s communist regime in 1956 with help from the International Red Cross. After some time in Canada, he was reunited with his family in Los Angeles.</p><p> After studying at UCLA, Vajna operated cinemas in Hong Kong, where he also established a successful wig-making company.</p><p> In the mid-1970s, Vajna set up Carolco, a film production firm, with Mario Kassar. Besides the Rambo series, the two men were also behind films like \u201cVictory\u201d  starring Stallone, Michael Caine and Pele; \u201cRed Heat\u201d and \u201cTotal Recall,\u201d starring Schwarzenegger; and \u201cAngel Heart\u201d and \u201cJohnny Handsome\u201d with Mickey Rourke.</p><p> After leaving Carolco in 1989, Vajna\u2019s films included \u201cTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\u201d \u201dDie Hard with a Vengeance,\u201d \u201dThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201dNixon\u201d and \u201cI Spy.\u201d</p><p> He also produced several successful Hungarian films and was co-owner of Korda Studios, in the village of Etyek, near Budapest, where \u201cThe Martian,\u201d \u201dInferno\u201d and \u201cHellboy II: The Golden Army\u201d were filmed.</p><p> Late last year, Vajna was among a handful of businesspeople close to Orban who donated most of their media holdings to a nonprofit foundation overseen by an Orban ally, a move which put over 470 publications under even closer political control.</p><p> Vajna is survived by his wife, Timea.</p><p> Cartoon library gets Marmaduke collection spanning 56 years</p><p> By ERIC LAGATTA</p><p> The Columbus Dispatch</p><p> Sunday, January 20</p><p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  A Great Dane known for making mischief has a permanent home in Columbus.</p><p> The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum has acquired more than 16,000 Marmaduke cartoons from 1954 to 2010. The cartoons are part of a collection that includes strip\u2019s creator Brad Anderson\u2019s original art, correspondence, fan mail, memorabilia and more.</p><p> Anderson had no significant connection to Columbus but, before his death in 2015, had been in contact with the library\u2019s curators about housing his work at the venue, curator Jenny Robb said. The library, on the Ohio State University campus, also serves as an archive for the National Cartoonists Society, of which Anderson was a member.</p><p> \u201cMy dad had said for a number of years that he wanted all his Marmadukes and all his collection of cartoons and other artifacts to go to the museum because he thought they did a wonderful job\u201d said Christine Potchernick, one of Anderson\u2019s four children. \u201cHe was very impressed with the museum.\u201d</p><p> Robb said the museum is grateful for the privilege of maintaining such a beloved strip.</p><p> \u201cMarmaduke is one of the most popular (comics) of the 20th century and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people who are pet owners can identify with it, and it has \u2026 entertained people for decades.\u201d</p><p> The library is working to catalog and digitize the collection  a process that could take a year or more, Robb said. Once that is complete, she said, the museum might display some of the work in a gallery.</p><p> In the meantime, Robb said, the public, upon request, can view any part of the collection in the library\u2019s reading room. Some of it is already available as part of the Billy Ireland\u2019s digital collection.</p><p> Anderson, who grew up drawing cartoons in Jamestown, New York, created Marmaduke in 1954. He drew the series about the havoc-wreaking but lovable dog and his family until his death, since which his son Paul has continued to create the syndicated strip.</p><p> In addition to those cartoons, the collection obtained by the Billy Ireland includes Anderson\u2019s early watercolor paintings from his undergraduate years at Syracuse University in New York and 3,000 of his magazine cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s.</p><p> Potchernick, who lives with her husband in Montgomery, Texas, is excited to see her father\u2019s life work live on at the museum.</p><p> \u201cI just think so many people with dogs can relate to Marmaduke,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought comics were an important part of everyday life, and he always said, \u2018If they give a little smile or chuckle, I\u2019m happy.\u2019\u201d</p><p> Online: <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/2FBFdzt\">https://bit.ly/2FBFdzt</url></p><p> Information from: The Columbus Dispatch, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dispatch.com\">http://www.dispatch.com</url></p><p> EU\u2019s antitrust cop lays groundwork for more tech scrutiny</p><p> By KELVIN CHAN</p><p>AP Business Writer</p><p> Monday, January 21</p><p> COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP)  Silicon Valley\u2019s notorious nemesis, Margrethe Vestager, plans to end her term as the European Union\u2019s antitrust enforcer this year with a bang, laying out a long-term plan to intensify scrutiny of the world\u2019s big tech companies.</p><p> As the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Vestager is arguably the world\u2019s most important tech regulator. Since 2014, she has slapped Google with eye-popping multibillion-dollar antitrust penalties, ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook over its WhatsApp acquisition  flagship enforcement cases that have struck fear into Silicon Valley while drawing attention in Washington.</p><p> Now, in her final year in office, the 50-year-old Danish politician is laying the groundwork for a new phase of regulation beyond the end of her term in October.</p><p> She\u2019s planning a report meant to guide EU competition policies in the era of digitization. Feedback from companies, business groups and experts shows many see the need for more regulation and when it\u2019s published in March, the report by three expert advisers will reflect the need for new or tougher rules, she told The Associated Press in a recent interview.</p><p> \u201cThe most important thing is that the majority of input is pro-enforcement,\u201d Vestager said during one of her frequent visits to Copenhagen from her Brussels base. The digital technology industry can no longer be allowed to shape itself, she added. \u201cWe are way beyond that.\u201d</p><p> It\u2019s unclear yet what shape the new enforcement will take but it may not bode well for the big U.S. technology companies that have landed in Vestager\u2019s crosshairs.</p><p> Vestager has cultivated a down-to-earth image  she likes to knit elephants during meetings  that belies her formidable powers of enforcement.</p><p> She opened three antitrust cases against Google, including one that resulted in a record 4.3 billion euro ($5 billion) fine for forcing cellphone makers to use the internet giant\u2019s software on Android phones. Another 2.4 billion euro ($2.8 billion) penalty was punishment for manipulating shopping search results. She aims to wrap up a probe before her term ends of whether Google blocked rivals from its Adsense ad service.</p><p> Vestager ordered Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes from Ireland. Apple CEO Tim Cook called it \u201ctotal political crap\u201d and President Donald Trump referred to her as the \u201ctax lady\u201d who \u201creally hates the U.S.\u201d</p><p> The EU competition commissioner, with a 900-strong staff, is unusually powerful in the Brussels bureaucracy because it can enforce bloc-wide rules, giving it the power to take on countries and companies. Other departments typically share regulatory duties with national governments. Vestager\u2019s job includes approving or rejecting mergers and investigating cartels and antitrust behavior. She also makes sure EU states don\u2019t give tax breaks to individual companies that are not available to other corporations  legitimate business strategy in the U.S. but illegal in Europe.</p><p> A lot of attention is now falling on data, the commodity that drives the digital economy.</p><p> Information collected by web browsers, apps, smartphones and other devices can be enormously valuable to companies because they can provide insight about, for example, an individual\u2019s buying habits and movements. Data can power artificial intelligence or be used to show targeted advertisements. Vestager is concerned that a small group of companies could corner the market and abuse their power.</p><p> She started confronting the problem with an informal probe launched last year into whether online shopping giant Amazon is using data to gain an edge on third party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. She hopes to decide within six months whether to open a formal investigation.</p><p> Many people still aren\u2019t sure how to take control of their personal information. New European privacy rules introduced last year were a start, obliging companies to be more transparent with customers about what they do with people\u2019s data. But consumers are often still overwhelmed by detailed consent forms for third-party tracking on each new site they visit or the fine print of an app\u2019s service terms.</p><p> Vestager, a member of a small left wing political party who believes in free markets, said the private sector can play a role in finding solutions.</p><p> \u201cI think you need products that will help you exercise your rights. Independent digital assistants that will make sure that your privacy settings are maintained no matter where you go. That kind of stuff,\u201d she said.</p><p> Vestager, whose party was founded by her great-grandfather, was Denmark\u2019s deputy prime minister and economy minister before taking up her post in Brussels in late 2014. She reportedly keeps a sculpture of a hand with an extended middle finger in her office, a gift from a Danish trade union angered by her welfare cuts. She\u2019s said to be one of the inspirations for the lead character in the Danish TV show \u201cBorgen,\u201d about an ambitious minor politician trying to become the country\u2019s first female prime minister.</p><p> Although Vestager\u2019s term runs out in October, she\u2019s hoping for a second stint, an unlikely prospect because her party is out of power in Denmark and its prospects look uncertain in upcoming elections. The EU\u2019s executive commissioners are nominated by their country\u2019s governments.</p><p> \u201cSometimes things are unlikely but not impossible,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something and we\u2019re not done yet,\u201d she added, referring to the new era of digital regulation.</p><p> Vestager brushes off criticism that she\u2019s stifling innovation by targeting U.S. companies to help prop up European firms. She has also taken on Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s and this month opened an investigation into Nike\u2019s tax arrangements. But other targets have included Italian automaker Fiat and Russian gas giant Gazprom.</p><p> \u201cWhen you look at our cases you\u2019d see that what they have in common is not nationality. It\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re multinationals,\u201d she said.</p><p> Her aim, she says, is to keep competition fair.</p><p> \u201cThat was the idea before the world became digital,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cAnd it becomes an even more important idea when the world becomes digital because things are so fast moving.\u201d</p><p> Follow Kelvin Chan at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/chanman\">www.twitter.com/chanman</url></p><p> World economy forecast to slow in 2019 amid trade tensions</p><p> By PAUL WISEMAN</p><p>AP Economics Writer</p><p> Monday, January 21</p><p>DAVOS, Switzerland (AP)  The world economy absorbed more bad news Monday: The International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for 2019. And China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, said it had slowed to its weakest pace since 1990.</p><p> The IMF cut its estimate for global growth this year to 3.5 percent, from the 3.7 percent it had predicted in October and down from 2018\u2019s 3.7 percent. The fund cited heightened trade tensions and rising interest rates.</p><p> \u201cAfter two years of solid expansion, the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising,\u201d said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde as she presented the forecasts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p> The IMF is not alone in its pessimism. The World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other forecasters have also downgraded their world growth estimates.</p><p> Among the key concerns is the Chinese economy. The country is slowing just as its leadership tries to turn it into a more modern economy by reducing its reliance on manufacturing and exports and increasing consumer spending.</p><p> The country reported Monday growth of 6.6 percent in 2018, the weakest since 1990. Demand for Chinese exports weakened last year and the IMF expects China\u2019s growth to decelerate again this year  to 6.2 percent.</p><p> The IMF left its prediction for U.S. growth this year unchanged at 2.5 percent  though a continuation of the partial 31-day shutdown of the federal government poses a risk.</p><p> The IMF trimmed the outlook for the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency to 1.6 percent from 1.8 percent. Germany got a big downgrade from the IMF, the result of weaker demand for German exports and problems in the country\u2019s auto industry.</p><p>Britain\u2019s messy divorce from the European Union and Italy\u2019s ongoing financial struggles also pose threats to growth in Europe.</p><p> Emerging-market countries are forecast to slow to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent in 2018. That is partly a result of China\u2019s deceleration, which pinches developing countries that supply it with raw materials such as copper and iron ore.</p><p> \u201cChina\u2019s growth slowdown could be faster than expected especially if trade tensions continue, and this can trigger abrupt sell-offs in financial and commodity markets\u201d  something that happened when Chinese growth sputtered in 2015, said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath.</p><p> Under President Donald Trump the United States has imposed import taxes on steel, aluminum and hundreds of Chinese products, drawing retaliation from China and other U.S. trading partners.</p><p> \u201cHigher trade uncertainty will further dampen investment and disrupt global supply chains,\u201d Gopinath said.</p><p> Rising interest rates in the U.S. and elsewhere are also pinching emerging-market governments and companies that borrowed heavily when rates were ultra-low in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 Great Recession.</p><p> As the debts roll over, those borrowers have to refinance at higher rates. A rising dollar is also making things harder for emerging-market borrowers who took out loans denominated in the U.S. currency.</p><p> Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of Davos here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apnews.com/Davos\">https://www.apnews.com/Davos</url></p><p> Ice glazes over swath of US as wind chills fall below zero</p><p> By PHILIP MARCELO and CATHERINE PERLOFF</p><p> The Associated Press</p><p> Monday, January 21</p><p> BOSTON (AP)  Bitter cold is setting in after a major winter storm blanketed a wide swath of the country in snow, sleet and rain this weekend, creating dangerously icy conditions that promise to complicate cleanup efforts and make travel challenging on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p><p> Some of the coldest temperatures felt so far this season started to set in across the Midwest and Northeast Sunday and are expected to plunge further overnight.</p><p> Wind chills will bring temperatures into teens in the New York City area and down to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius) in upstate New York, the National Weather Service predicted.</p><p> In New England, they\u2019ll fall to as low as 20 F (29 C) below zero around Boston and as low as 35 F (37 C) below zero in parts of Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire, the service said.</p><p> Temperatures across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and the Mid-Atlantic will drop 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average, the service said.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s life-threatening,\u201d said Ray O\u2019Keefe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albany. \u201cThese are dangerous conditions that we\u2019re going to be in and they\u2019re prolonged, right through tomorrow.\u201d</p><p> The freeze will follow the weekend\u2019s run-ins with power outages, canceled trains and planes, overnight stays at the airport and traffic jams.</p><p> Local officials warned residents to limit their time outside to prevent frostbite and to avoid treacherous travel conditions. They also said places could see strong wind gusts, flooding and further power outages.</p><p> Utilities in Connecticut reported more than 20,000 customers without power by Sunday afternoon.</p><p> \u201cWe had more freezing rain and sleet than we expected,\u201d Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said Sunday as public works crews across the state raced to clear and treat major roadways before dangerous black ice could form.</p><p>Amtrak canceled trains across the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend, but promised full service would resume Monday. Boston\u2019s transit system urged commuters to allow 10 to 15 minutes of extra travel time and warned of icy conditions for pedestrians come Monday.</p><p> The storm  caused by the clash of an Arctic high-pressure system with a low-pressure system coming through the Ohio Valley  wreaked havoc on air travel and other forms of transportation all weekend.</p><p> More than 1,500 flights were canceled nationwide Sunday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking company.</p><p> Among the hardest hit was Boston\u2019s Logan Airport, where stranded passengers lingered Sunday as typically bustling security lines, ticketing counters and baggage claims were largely deserted.</p><p> Xavi Ortega, a 32-year old engineer from Spain, said he and his wife slept overnight at the airport after their Saturday night flight home to Barcelona was canceled. He said the couple hoped to board a flight Sunday night.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve been sleeping, playing Candy Crush,\u201d Ortega said when asked how\u2019d they been passing the hours.</p><p> A ferry service route across Lake Champlain between Vermont and New York was also closed Sunday and flights were mostly cancelled at major airports in Vermont and New Hampshire.</p><p> In the Midwest, where it dumped 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow in parts, the storm caused a plane to skid on a slick runway at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport on Saturday, though no injuries were reported.</p><p> In Kansas, a snowplow driver was killed when his vehicle rolled over, and in southeastern Missouri, slippery conditions caused a 15-vehicle crash on Interstate 55 on Saturday.</p><p> One saving grace of the storm: heavily populated coastal communities from New York to Boston largely escaped major snowfall after days of sometimes dire predictions.</p><p> Manhattan saw mostly rain while places along Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts\u2019 coast recorded 2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 centimeters) of snow.</p><p> Mountain regions saw significantly more, to the delight of ski resort operators.</p><p>New York\u2019s Adirondacks registered up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) while western Massachusetts\u2019 Berkshires saw as much as 10 and parts of northern New England were on track to approach 24 inches of snow.</p><p> Nicholas Nicolet and his 6-year-old son Rocco welcomed the fresh powder as they cross-country skied on the sidewalks of Montpelier, Vermont early Sunday morning.</p><p> \u201cWe think it\u2019s great,\u201d Nicholas Nicolet said during the storm.</p><p> President Donald Trump urged Americans affected by the winter storm to \u201cbe careful\u201d in a tweet early Sunday. But, as he\u2019s done in the past, Trump conflated the short-term weather phenomenon with longer-term climate change.</p><p> The White House\u2019s own National Climate Assessment recently rejected the idea that a particular plunge in temperatures can cast uncertainty on whether Earth is warming.</p><p> \u201cAmazing how big this system is,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!\u201d</p><p>Associated Press reporters Bob Salsberg in Boston, Deepti Hajela in New York, and Lisa Rathke in Montpelier contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-122168041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A92EA5CDD23 NWBKOH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8D-GPC1-DXVP-V15H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 AIM Media Midwest Operating, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Professor Alexis Jay, inquiry chairwoman, said: \"The serious threat of child sexual abuse facilitated by the internet is an urgent problem which cannot be overstated.</p><p>\"Despite industry advances in technology to detect and combat online-facilitated abuse, the risk of immeasurable harm to children and their families shows no sign of diminishing.</p><p>\"The panel and I hope this report and its recommendations lead internet companies, law enforcement and government to implement vital measures to prioritise the protection of children and prevent abuse facilitated online.\"</p><p>The report is based on 14 days of public hearings held in January 2018 and May 2019, during which the Met - Britain's biggest police force - said it witnessed a 700% spike in the number of online child abuse cases referred to them by national investigators over three years.</p><p>It also heard that live-streaming websites were \"enabling\" paedophiles to widely share videos of child sexual abuse by failing to effectively combat the threat.</p><p>In its 114-page report, published yesterday, the inquiry made four recommendations to government: \u00a6 to require industry to prescreen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children; \u00a6 to press the WeProtect Global Alliance - a group comprising 97 governments, 25 technology companies and 30 civil society organisations - to take more action internationally to ensure that those countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access to such imagery; \u00a6 to introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices, and; \u00a6 to publish, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the Online Harms White Paper.</p><p>The government is currently working on new legislation around online harms, including placing a statutory duty of care on tech companies to keep their users safe, overseen by an independent regulator.</p><p>Earlier this month the UK joined the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in launching the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, which detailed actions tech companies should take to protect younger users on their platforms.</p><p>The pledges range from stopping existing and new child sex abuse material appearing on platforms to taking steps to stop the livestreaming of abuse, and identifying and stopping grooming and predatory behaviour.</p><p>The proposals were endorsed by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tik-Tok, Twitter and Snap.</p><p>But yesterday's report identified that there were no evident barriers to pre-screening images.</p><p>It said: \"Industry has failed to do all it can to prevent access to images of child sexual abuse.</p><p>\"The time has come to stop access to such imagery by requiring industry to pre-screen <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.material.No\">www.material.No</url> industry witness said that such a step was technologically impossible.\"</p><p>It said there had \"been an explosion in online-facilitated child sexual abuse\" and said \"law enforcement is struggling to keep pace\". The report also found that indecent images could \"be accessed all too easily\", saying that the child involved was re-victimised every time the image was viewed.</p><p>The report said: \"The time has come for the Government to stop access to indecent images of children by requiring industry to prescreen material.\"</p><p>It added that while there was evidence of \"the positive intentions by industry to tackle onlinefacilitated child sexual abuse and exploitation\", there was \"a lack of a coherent long-term strategy on how this is to be achieved\".</p><p>The report concludes the latest strand of the inquiry, which has also focused on the role of the political establishment in dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse.</p><p>Sue Hargreaves, chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation charity, which contributed evidence to the inquiry, welcomed the report. She said: \"There is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators online.</p><p>\"This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses.\"</p><p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, described the report as \"a damning indictment of Big Tech's failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WESTML-158344883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WESTML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDK-70B1-JCBW-N3FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244366</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Western Mail and Echo Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Western Mail</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 13, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He raised it at a meeting with his counterparts from the Five Eyes countries of the US, UK, Canada and Australia in August last year.</p><p>He declined to be interviewed on the issue today.</p><p>In a speech at the recent swearing in of Justice Helen Winkelmann as Chief Justice prior to the mosque shootings, Parker predicted challenges for her in the area of social media.</p><p>\"Where does the limit lie between freedom of speech and harmful fake news or hateful propaganda,\" he asked.</p><p>\"What duties are owed by those who profit from social media platforms to society, private citizens, or to the public institutions which democracy relies upon?</p><p>\"These are very important and complex issues for our time and the wisdom of the courts you lead will help achieve wise outcomes.\"</p><p>And speaking to reporters following an assault on Green Party co-leader James Shaw just a day before the mosque shootings, Parker criticised the role of social media in spreading extreme opinions that fed political biases.</p><p>He said the British Digital Culture, Media and Sport select committee, which looked into the issues of disinformation and fakes news, was right to call out the kind of extreme opinion shared via social media which fuelled biases and caused instability among some people.</p><p>\"We need to reflect upon what\"s going on in society that causes people to be so extreme in their reactions to things they disagree with,\" he said.</p><p>In its final report the committee, chaired by Tory MP Damian Collins, called for:</p><p>bull A compulsory code of ethics for tech companies overseen by an independent regulator</p><p>bull The regulator to be funded by a levy on tech companies operating in the UK</p><p>bull Powers for the regulator to launch legal action against companies breaching the code of ethics</p><p>bull Social media companies obliged to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation</p><p>bull Hefty fines for companies that fail in their obligations on harmful or illegal content</p><p>In releasing the report last month, Collins said: \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \"dark adverts\" from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day.\"</p><p>He said the big tech companies were failing in the duty of care they owed to their users to act against harmful content.</p><p>\"These are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the \"move fast and break things\" culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission,\" Collins said.</p><p>Little, who is also in charge of the Harmful Digital Communications Act, says there is a willingness in Government to look more closely at what is wrong with social media and what powers could be used to rein in the worst aspects of it.</p><p>He agreed social media was becoming more toxic.</p><p>\"It\"s kind of got to the point where it\"s almost a parody of itself. You go on Twitter to bathe in the toxicity and putrescence of it. You don\"t take it seriously,</p><p>\"On the other hand, I\"ve seen stuff on Facebook which causes my toes to curl and wonder about the mentality of some people.\"</p><p>The Harmful Digital Communications Act was about \"clear expressions of hatred and threats expressed towards individuals through the internet, social media platforms and the like\".</p><p>\"One of the challenges the law always has been to draw that line between upholding and protecting free speech but on the other hand clearly dealing with expressions that are calculated to cause harm or incite others to cause harm.</p><p>\"The law is always trying to find that balance. I believe that legislation that we\"ve got in place at the moment does that. If there\"s any call for review or change, let\"s have a look at that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12216013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR5-6R81-JCBG-G0VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O\u2019Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that</p><p>Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. O\u2019Sullivan quit the next day.</p><p> \u201cI was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,\u201d she said. Zeiler and Clarifai didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, though Zeiler has previously said the company\u2019s Project Maven involvement aligns with its mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.</p><p> O\u2019Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a \u201cgrowing backlash against unethical tech,\u201d a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out \u2014 pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.</p><p> While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:</p><p> \u2014 Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.</p><p> \u2014 Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.</p><p> \u2014 Following last year\u2019s walkouts over Google\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.</p><p> \u2014 Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies\u2019 ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.</p><p> Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.</p><p> They\u2019re feeling emboldened because of national and global \u201cexistential crises\u201d and the realization that tech companies \u201chave more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,\u201d Dubal said.</p><p> The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom\u2019s housing affordability crisis.</p><p> \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,\u201d said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cIf you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you\u2019re working with to build these tools.\u201d</p><p>Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p> An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn\u2019t directly address employees\u2019 renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.</p><p> A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides \u201cmany avenues for all voices to be heard.\u201d</p><p> A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s previous statements on worker dissent.</p><p> \u201cThere are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,\u201d he said at a November conference. \u201cThere are decisions we make which they may not agree with.\u201d</p><p>Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech\u2019s effect on the country.</p><p> \u201cAs an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), \u2018What is my responsibility?\u2019\u201d said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p><p> Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook\u2019s San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they\u2019re all working people.</p><p> \u201cOur fortunes are tied together,\u201d Gaber said. \u201cIf the (companies) can\u2019t even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?\u201d</p><p> There\u2019s evidence companies are listening.</p><p>Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.</p><p> When employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.</p><p> A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and \u201chire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.\u201d</p><p> In the wake of concerns about tech\u2019s impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless.

Know more about Russia than your friends: Get our free ebook on how the Soviet Union became Putin's Russia. Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[5] Fight for the Future[6], a leading digital rights group thathas called for[7]a complete Federal ban on government use of facial recognition surveillance, welcomes this legislation, reportedly titled the 'No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act.' </p><p>'Facial recognition surveillance should be banned everywhere, but keeping it out of public housing is an excellent start,'said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her),'This type of invasive surveillance technology is often tested on, and disproportionately used to target poor people and people of color. If public housing units become a panopticon of automated face scanning and monitoring[8], it will mean more people in prison, more police abuse, and more families torn apart. Surveillance of poor communities isn't about safety, it's about social control. Everyone deserves liberty and privacy in their own homes -- no one should have to choose between homelessness and losing their basic rights.' The new bill comes on the heels of growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country. Last week Fight for the Future releasedan interactive map[9]showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it.San Francisco[10],Somerville, MA,[11]andOakland, CA[12], recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology[13]. Berkeley is alsoconsidering[14]a ban, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in theMassachusetts[15]andMichigan[16] legislatures. In Congress, there isgrowing[17]bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech. Fight for the Future opposes attempts by the tech industry and law enforcement to pressure Congress[18] to pass an industry-friendly 'regulatory framework' for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance. For more on our position, readour op-ed in Buzzfeed News[19]:'Don't regulate facial recognition. Ban it.' The post Activist Calls For A Federal Ban On Facial Recognition Surveillance[20] appeared first on ValueWalk[21].

A new coalition and a report unveiled on Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grass-roots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is now beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p>\"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by the billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>\"It has incredible impact,\" Mr. Perriello said of Amazon. \"Who could possibly shape its future and direction?\"</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the last year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled? </p><p>In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really. </p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grass-roots efforts to rein in Amazon's power. </p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the City Council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters. </p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have - the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behavior - and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p>Athena's $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about. \"This is grass-roots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p>Mr. Perriello of the Open Society Foundations said updating protest movements for the digital era was an interesting challenge.</p><p>\"Uncertainty is now baked into the model,\" he said. \"You don't know where the fight is going to be two months from now or two years from now. So you need the ability to organize citizens of very different political stripes across geographies and across demographics, where traditionally you had to organize in place.\"</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name - People Against Amazon or whatever - because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. \"To be for something, not just against.\"</p><p>Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but more interested in trying to sway it - including its employees and customers.</p><p>\"Half the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,\" Mr. Kaoosji said. \"That gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.\" His group is dedicated to improving conditions in what is sometimes called \"the goods movement sector.\" </p><p>The resource center is in California's Inland Empire, where the work gets done to process those packages that appear on porches in Santa Monica and Newport Beach as if by magic. </p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little over half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>\"Every day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,\" the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in \"uncompensated public costs\" for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions.</p><p>Almost as an aside, the report indicated how adept Amazon, with a stock market value of nearly $900 billion, is at getting funding from California and local communities. This included $25 million from the California Film Commission to subsidize six productions, including the third season of \"Sneaky Pete,\" an Amazon crime drama, and $1.2 million from the California Office of Business and Economic Development toward an office building in Irvine for programmers.</p><p>The report noted on its title page that it was underwritten by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which represents more than 800,000 members of 300 unions. The Economic Roundtable said that did not affect the results. </p><p>Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p>The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon's business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p>\"Our conclusion is that it's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,\" said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. \"This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006836792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKW-HF71-JC85-N3J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A new coalition and a report unveiled on Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">Athena</url>, comprises three dozen grass-roots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is now beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">report, from the Economic Roundtable</url>, a nonprofit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon\u2019s push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">97,000 employees over the summer</url>, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \u201cToo Big to Govern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\u201d said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by the billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>\u201cIt has incredible impact,\u201d Mr. Perriello said of Amazon. \u201cWho could possibly shape its future and direction?\u201d</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">drawn the attention of Washington regulators</url>, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the last year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled? </p><p>In Amazon\u2019s case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really. </p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grass-roots efforts to rein in Amazon\u2019s power. </p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York</url> after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">stack the City Council</url> in Seattle, the company\u2019s hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters. </p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\u201d said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">Fight for the Future</url>, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon\u2019s surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and <url normalizedValue=\"https://athenaforall.org/\">Rekognition facial tracking software</url>. The products threaten \u201cour privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and black communities,\u201d the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\u201cThis is a David and Goliath story,\u201d she said. \u201cDavid took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We\u2019re taking what we have \u2014 the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we\u2019ve had with making this company shift its behavior \u2014 and trying to build a more humane economy.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about. \u201cThis is grass-roots democracy,\u201d said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \u201cThere\u2019s no money in it. Just people.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Perriello of the Open Society Foundations said updating protest movements for the digital era was an interesting challenge.</p><p>\u201cUncertainty is now baked into the model,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where the fight is going to be two months from now or two years from now. So you need the ability to organize citizens of very different political stripes across geographies and across demographics, where traditionally you had to organize in place.\u201d</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have Amazon in the name \u2014 People Against Amazon or whatever \u2014 because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. \u201cTo be for something, not just against.\u201d</p><p>Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but more interested in trying to sway it \u2014 including its employees and customers.</p><p>\u201cHalf the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,\u201d Mr. Kaoosji said. \u201cThat gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.\u201d His group is dedicated to improving conditions in what is sometimes called \u201cthe goods movement sector.\u201d </p><p>The resource center is in California\u2019s Inland Empire, where the work gets done to process those packages that appear on porches in Santa Monica and Newport Beach as if by magic. </p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little over half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>\u201cEvery day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,\u201d the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in \u201cuncompensated public costs\u201d for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions.</p><p>Almost as an aside, the report indicated how adept Amazon, with a stock market value of nearly $900 billion, is at getting funding from California and local communities. This included $25 million from the California Film Commission to subsidize six productions, including the third season of \u201cSneaky Pete,\u201d an Amazon crime drama, and $1.2 million from the California Office of Business and Economic Development toward an office building in Irvine for programmers.</p><p>The report noted on its title page that it was underwritten by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which represents more than 800,000 members of 300 unions. The Economic Roundtable said that did not affect the results. </p><p>Among the report\u2019s suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p>The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon\u2019s business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p>\u201cOur conclusion is that it\u2019s time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,\u201d said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. \u201cThis means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: A report said that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California lived in substandard housing.

Members of Congress who support the bill believe it will increase pay for 27 million workers and lift over one million people out of poverty, but those opposed to the bill say it would cause millions more to lose their jobs. Dave Hebert, professor of economics at Aquinas College, joins the podcast to dispel some of the biggest misconceptions of raising federal minimum wage and what real effects the bill would have.</p><p>On the second segment, Glenn Harlan Reynolds, professor of law at the University of Tennessee and author of the new book, The Social Media Upheaval, joins the show to examine the benefits and drawbacks of social media. Glenn argues that social media and especially Twitter is increasingly poisoning journalism and politics.

I'm Rosemary Church. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CYRIL VANIER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  And I'm Cyril Vanier and we're following breaking news this hour, the death of actress Debbie Reynolds at the age of 84.  This is just one day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher, died from a cardiac event. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHURCH:  Reynolds was a huge star in the '50s and '60s but never stopped entertaining.  CNN correspondent Leyla Santiago has more on her death. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Rosemary and Cyril, we still don't know exactly what led to Debbie Reynolds' death but let's walk you through what happened.   </p><p>Wednesday afternoon we understand she was complaining of some breathing issues.  That's when L.A. Fire Department responded to the family's Beverly Hills home.  At that time we were told she was in fair to serious condition.   </p><p>When we checked in with her son, he told us, simply, \"Pray for her.\" But a few hours later things changed.  We checked in with her son again and here's the statement from him. </p><p>He told us, \"She spoke to me this morning and said she missed Carrie. She's with Carrie now.\"   </p><p>Of course all of this comes just a day after we reported Carrie Fisher's death.  She was on her way to L.A. from London when she went into cardiac arrest and she died Tuesday morning which, of course, has really seen an outpouring of support from fans now and family.   </p><p>Debbie Reynolds' stepdaughter tweeting out, \"Some of the magic people have left the tribe.  For the moment, I am inconsolable.\"   </p><p>We have also seen other Hollywood celebrities tweeting and reaching out to the family and on the star, Debbie Reynolds' star, we are already starting to see flowers and candles of what I'm sure will be a growing memorial for the legend -- Rosemary, Cyril. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>VANIER:  Joining us now for more on that is Michael Musto, a New York columnist.   </p><p>Michael, a lot of major artists passed away in 2016; in fact, it's quite striking -- David Bowie, George Michael, Leonard Cohen -- and those are all musicians.  That's not the case of Debbie Reynolds; she was really a multifaceted artist, known mostly as a TV and cinema person.   </p><p>What trace do you think will she leave in history? </p><p>MICHAEL MUSTO, OUT.COM:  Much like her daughter, Carrie Fisher, who died the day before Debbie died, she was a movie legend.  Just like you mentioned, David Bowie, Prince, George Michael, their deaths were blows to the music world.   </p><p>Debbie and Carrie's loss was a loss to the movie world.  Debbie was the star of \"Singing in the Rain,\" which is arguably the best movie musical  ever made.  She was Oscar-nominated for \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" in which she played the woman who survived the Titanic.  </p><p>She also did Broadway.  She did cabaret.  She had a casino.  She did everything.  Debbie was a singing, dancing, tap dancing demon, who loved to entertain and did so in all media.   </p><p>She also was on TV.  She was on \"Golden Girls\" for an episode.  She played Debra Messing's mother, I believe, in \"Will and Grace,\" and was somebody who was just a familiar face that you could always rely on for entertainment value. </p><p>VANIER:  Correct me if I'm wrong but I get the sense that there are not many contemporary artists who are as multiskilled, as multifaceted as she was.  You referenced the fact that she was an actress but she was also a singer.  She had records that came, she was on TV, she was a businesswoman. </p><p>Seems to me that's pretty rare these days. </p><p>MUSTO:  Everybody wants to be a Debbie Reynolds because all the music stars are always trying to do TV and movies so they could branch out. Everybody in movies is trying to direct so they could branch out. None of them can approach Debbie Reynolds with her versatility.  She truly had range.   </p><p>She mastered every single medium there was and she managed to be personable and deliver to her audiences who came to rely on her as a really likable person.   </p><p>But while she was always pitched as an ingenue, as kind of a sweet girl next door, there was a lot more to Debbie than that.  She was a complicated person, just like Carrie.  Carrie wasn't Princess Leia any more than Debbie was really the girl from \"Singing in the Rain.\" </p><p>VANIER:  Tell us more about her personality. </p><p>MUSTO:  She was funny.  She was the ultimate professional.  She never missed an engagement and tried never to miss a performance and always delivered.  And she eventually got frail.  She was 84 and she had to step down from show biz.   </p><p>But whenever she was offered a special award or something, she would show up and she would just glow with the attention because she lived for the spotlight. </p><p>VANIER:  One of the things that strikes me, I was just reading up about her career and I didn't know how she had started before she got her big break is when she was 16 years old.  She was spotted at a beauty pageant in California and she was really somebody who wanted the light, who wanted to be a Hollywood star. </p><p>And from that moment on, it's sort of this stereotypical story of people who want to make it in Hollywood.  And it started when she was 16 at a beauty pageant,  lasted until she was 84. </p><p>MUSTO:  She did.  She wanted the stardom and she got it.  She went after that brass ring and it's not just the drive and determination; it's the fact that she had talent.  She was able to sing and dance and -- </p><p>[01:05:00] </p><p>MUSTO:  -- do comedy and drama.  She was able to do it all. </p><p>And it became a little competitive when Carrie Fisher, her daughter, started becoming famous and got parts in \"Shampoo\" and then, of course, played Princess Leia in \"Star Wars.\"   </p><p>Things were a little touch-and-go between Debbie and Carrie but through the years, they ironed out their kinks and their problems and they became so close they were truly a unit and it was inspiring to see the rapport that those two developed.  And I'm sure it was heartbreak that killed Debbie Reynolds because, when Carrie died, Debbie just was hopeless and helpless. </p><p>VANIER:  Well, that's what her son said to CNN, that the morning before she passed away, she said that she missed Carrie. </p><p>MUSTO:  She missed her terribly.  She never thought she'd have to live a life without Carrie.  And no parent thinks they are going to outlive their child, who's going to die before them and that was a tragic turn of events.   </p><p>And when it happened, I even said that I hope they don't even tell Debbie.  I wish they could somehow shield her from the reality that her daughter had died because it's going to be so painful for her, even though the entire world was rallying around her and saying, we love you, Debbie. We're here for you.  It was still so devastating for her.  And I'm sure that had a big factor to play in her physical demise. </p><p>VANIER:  All right, New York columnist, Michael Musto, thank you very much for your time and thanks for your insights. </p><p>MUSTO:  Thank you. </p><p>CHURCH:  And Segun Oduolowu is live via Skype from Lake Tahoe.  He is an entertainment journalist and pop culture contributor for \"Access Hollywood Live.\"  </p><p>And entertainment journalist Holland Reid is here with us in the studio.   </p><p>Thank you to both of you. </p><p>We want to start with Debbie Reynolds in \"Singing in the Rain,\" because that is how people think of her and she is defined by that role.  That's really what set her whole career on fire.  So let's just have a look at that first.   </p><p>(VIDEO CLIP, \"SINGING IN THE RAIN\") </p><p>CHURCH:  And Segun, I want to go to you first because this, when I saw this movie when I was younger, very much younger, I -- this just was an incredible movie and to know that she was not a dancer before she did this, she actually was shown these steps and she was shut away for, what, three months or so. </p><p>SEGUN ODUOLOWU, \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD LIVE\":  Yes, this is -- you know the only modern equivalent would be Whitney Houston, who is not an actress, doing like \"The Bodyguard\" and blowing it out of the water but Whitney wasn't a teenager at the time.  Debbie was.   </p><p>And she is dancing alongside arguably one of the best dancers Hollywood has ever seen.  She's holding her own, she's singing, she's beautiful, she's gorgeous at this young age and then, as I said, her career starts to keep going and spanning all of these decades.   </p><p>So, again, we lost Hollywood royalty.  We lost class.  We lost grace. And to piggyback what the last gentleman said, it's ironic that a woman who gave us so much laughter, so much charm, so much warmth died of a broken heart with the passing of her daughter. </p><p>CHURCH:  Just extraordinary. </p><p>And, Holland Reid, it is unbelievable when you look at that piece to know she is only 19. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HOLLAND REID, ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST:  -- 19 years old.  No professional training, hand-picked by Gene Kelly himself.   </p><p>Soft shoe, first of all, is not a dance that you just pick up overnight.  Is it something that you have to -- there is an eloquence about it.  It's a skill like -- not like regular tap.   </p><p>So to watch her going, gosh, she really nailed that.  Again, it's baffling that she was not a professional dancer.  Not only did you have to find your light but hit your marks, remember your lines to the song and know -- learn dance moves that you have never really done before, beyond impressive. </p><p>CHURCH:  Unbelievable. </p><p>VANIER:  And the way she expressed it herself was that she said she was actually too dumb to be afraid.  Because normally that age, you are afraid. </p><p>REID:  Naivete takes you far sometimes in Hollywood. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VANIER:  We saw that from the beginning of her career.  She was in her late teens.  I want to show you now something from the back end of her career, what we now know was the -- toward the end of her career.  It was in 2011 and it shows you just how she could take over an interview, just with her sunny personality.  This is one moment with Joy Behar, back in 2011. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JOY BEHAR, TV HOST:  You got into show biz by accident? </p><p>DEBBIE REYNOLDS, ENTERTAINER:  Yes, I entered a local beauty contest because we were a really poor family.  And they gave away a free blouse and a scarf you entered.  Not  you didn't win and I wanted a free blouse so scarf silk.  I was so excited and I won.   </p><p>And that started it.  There were talent scouts there.  They took me to the studio and they changed my name to Debbie and it just happened like that.   </p><p>BEHAR:  What was your name (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>[01:10:00] </p><p>REYNOLDS:  Mary Frances, Mary Frances. </p><p>BEHAR:  Mary Frances Reynolds? </p><p>REYNOLDS:  Mary Frances Reynolds. </p><p>BEHAR:  It sounds like a nun. </p><p>REYNOLDS:  Does it? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BEHAR:  Mary Frances Reynolds, yes -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>REYNOLDS:  -- because -- you say that because you're Catholic. BEHAR:  I am. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>REYNOLDS:  (Speaking Italian) </p><p>BEHAR:  I'm not that Italian. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>VANIER:  So, Segun, you were getting really emotional when we first spoke to you an hour ago.  Not many stars today that will look and sound that way. </p><p>ODUOLOWU:  Well, she's on \"The View,\" she's talking to Joy Behar, and she slips into Italian and won't let these performers outshine her but she did it with so much class and so much style and panache.  When you cover Hollywood like I do and so many entertainment journalists, you are bogged down by so much, you know, just gotcha journalism or people doing scandal.   </p><p>But here is someone who had her husband stolen by Elizabeth Taylor and was so classy that she said, you know, look, I was a Girl Scout and he went for Elizabeth and they became friends later on.  That doesn't happen in Hollywood today.   </p><p>Now it's scandal and vitriol and who can get caught out doing something crazy.  And here is someone who just kept it classy.  And even when she was going through turmoil with Carrie, weathered every storm.  I miss that.  That's why I got into the business for; that's what Hollywood was, bright lights and shiny stars. </p><p>And we lost one.  Hollywood is a little bit different tonight. </p><p>CHURCH:  And she did keep it classy, didn't she, Holland?   </p><p>And I did want to talk about the relationship that she had with Carrie Fisher.  You know, there were difficult times as there always are with mother-daughter relationships but really they did reconcile at the end there and they were so very close and just the fact she died just one day after Carrie Fisher died is an indication of that. </p><p>REID:  It -- everybody is saying that she died from a broken hard. This was a woman that fought -- take the actress off, take the talent away, she was a mother and she fought for her daughter.  She fought for her daughter's mental health.   </p><p>She said one of the worst times in her life was finding out the diagnosis of her being bipolar.  It broke her -- I can't even imagine having to deal with that.  But she was there for her daughter her entire life.   </p><p>They had that span of 10 years where they weren't close, they didn't really talk that often.  But then you also have the time in their life, they lived across the street from each other.  They were accepting awards together.  </p><p>So you see a mother that was being nothing short of just being a mother, a mother that loves and that cares that will do anything for her daughter.  She was an advocate for mental health awareness before she had her daughter.   </p><p>So now moving forward in her life and being that person for Carrie Fisher and dying the day after, she fought to the end.  And sometimes I guess a loss like that is just so great as a mother, I can't even imagine the idea of burying my own son.  So on this scale, I think everyone -- if you have a child or if you have your own mother can feel what that pain must even remotely closely be like. </p><p>CHURCH:  Absolutely, absolutely agree.   </p><p>Holland and Segun, thank you, both of you, for joining us for this discussion. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CHURCH:  -- very, very sad day for all. </p><p>Well, John Kerry is dropping the niceties with Israel with less than a month left as U.S. secretary of state.

You are watching CNN. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>[01:15:00] </p><p>(SPORTS) </p><p>VANIER:  John Kerry is getting blunt with Israel as his time as the U.S. secretary of state nears its end. </p><p>CHURCH:  He was scathing in his criticism of Israeli settlements on Wednesday, arguing that they are jeopardizing Middle East peace. CNN's Jim Sciutto has the details. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  Friends need to tell each other the hard truths. </p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Secretary of State John Kerry delivering a blunt message to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. KERRY:  The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history within an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.   </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Pushing back following Washington's decision not to veto the United Nations' vote condemning Israeli settlements in Jerusalem and the West Bank.   </p><p>KERRY:  On this point, I want to be very clear.  No American administration has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama's.   </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Kerry vehemently defended the U.S.  abstention, saying the very prospects of Middle East peace are at stake.   </p><p>KERRY:  The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two- state solution.  That's what we were standing up for.  The two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy.   </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Kerry acknowledged the U.S.  consulted on the resolution, but denies Israel's claim in the U.S.  was the driving force behind it.   </p><p>KERRY:  The United States did not draft or originate this resolution, nor did we put it forward.   </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Israel's Netanyahu called Kerry's speech disappointing and more.   </p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL:  Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders.   </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Prime Minister Netanyahu promised Israel has the evidence to prove that the U.S.  orchestrated the vote and would show that evidence to president-elect Trump when he takes office in just a few weeks.   </p><p>NETANYAHU:  We have it on absolutely incontestable evidence that the United States organized, advanced and brought this resolution to the United Nations Security Council.  We'll share that information with the incoming administration. </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  For his part, President-Elect Trump did not stand on the sidelines, tweeting before Kerry's speech, \"We cannot continue to let Israel -- </p><p>[01:20:00] </p><p>SCIUTTO (voice-over):  -- be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.  They used to have a great friend in the U.S.  but not anymore.  Stay strong, Israel, January 20th is fast approaching.\"  </p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu quickly tweeted back, \"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel.\"  Despite the public tensions, President Obama recently decided to increase U.S.  aid to Israel committing $38 billion over 10 years. Part of the largest pledge of military assistance in U.S.  history, which Kerry noted was not a new stance.   </p><p>KERRY:  In the midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we repeatedly increased funding to support Israel.  In fact, more than one half of our entire global foreign military financing goes to Israel.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>VANIER:  The talk radio host, Ethan Bearman (ph), joins me now from Los Angeles.   </p><p>Ethan, your point of view on this is interesting.  And I want to hear you out.  You are concerned about the impending Donald Trump presidency, including his policy vis-a-vis Israel, possibly; I imagine you'll tell us about that.   </p><p>But you're also concerned about the current U.S. policy, Washington letting a resolution critical of Israel pass at the U.N.  Security Council.  Tell us more. </p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN (PH), TALK RADIO HOST:  It's a little conflicting as a Jewish person but as an American citizen first; I look at what is happening in the Middle East and I look at the approach of the current administration as something problematic.  I did not appreciate or approve of the way the U.S. handled this.   </p><p>I think it was damaging to our relationship with Israel.  And I do look forward to President Trump being a better friend to Israel.  But overall I have concerns with the Trump presidency and I don't support it overall. </p><p>So we can be supportive of a President Trump or a President-Elect Trump regarding Israel.  But I'm going to be critical of him and cast a wary eye his way in everything else that he does as president here in the United States. </p><p>VANIER:  All right.  So let me take it in steps. </p><p>Why are you so concerned that the U.S. let the U.N.  Security Council pass a resolution critical of Israel?   </p><p>Previous U.S. administrations have done so in the past and they've done so more often than the Obama administration. </p><p>BEARMAN (PH):  Yes, well, I think in this specific situation, you have to look at the timing of the resolution.  You have to look at the wording of the resolution and you have to look at what has been going on the last several years here.  I personally think that the two-state solution at this point is dead. </p><p>And I don't see how in the Trump administration -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VANIER:  Does that mean you favor a one-state solution? </p><p>BEARMAN (PH):  Yes, I think so.  I think in my travels to Israel and the people that I have talked to, they are looking forward to a peace and stability.  And what I saw, Hamas, it's Judenrein in Gaza.  And the Palestinian Authority has shown no interest in having Jews living in its territory.   </p><p>So as Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about, are we looking at ethnic cleansing of the Jews if we just say, two-state solution, have this territory, Jews leave but the Arabs have full rights in Israel?   </p><p>I mean we have supreme court justices in Israel that are Arab -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VANIER:  -- interrupt you respectfully there for a second. </p><p>What would you answer then to the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, outgoing secretary of state,  who said today, Israel cannot remain a democracy if it pursues the one-state solution? </p><p>BEARMAN (PH):  Yes, I just don't agree with that.  I think he's totally wrong.  I think the two-state solution has been attempted now for 50 years-plus and nothing has changed.  Every time it is talking about Israel must do this or that. </p><p>And on what basis?   </p><p>So when Israel in the past, even in the Obama administration, did a 10-month freeze of settlements, did the Palestinians come forward? </p><p>Did anything change on the other side? </p><p>Nothing changed.  So doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.  I think a whole new approach needs to be taken.  I think what the Obama administration did undermines any kind of a new approach moving forward. </p><p>And I'm deeply concerned that there isn't going to be peace found in the next four years. </p><p>VANIER:  And what do you say to the argument that if Israel continues settlement building, it just makes a Palestinian state totally unviable? </p><p>BEARMAN (PH):  I think that's a fallacious argument because how many Palestinian refugee camps have there been since 1948 in the surrounding countries like Lebanon and Jordan and other places? </p><p>Did the Palestinian refugees get resettled in those countries? </p><p>And if not, why not? </p><p>These are the big questions that are never being asked. Why is the head of Hamas, have $2.6 billion that he is stealing from the people, the actual Palestinian people, are who I'm concerned about and who aren't being talked about here and the leadership is subjugating their own people and using them as pawns in these conversations. </p><p>VANIER:  Ethan Bearman (ph), thank you very much for giving us your opinion.  Ethan Bearman (ph) there, talk radio host, joining us from Los Angeles. </p><p>[01:25:00] </p><p>VANIER:  Thanks. </p><p>BEARMAN (PH):  Thank you. </p><p>CHURCH:  Now to another story we're following, the U.S. is expected to announce a series of reprisals against Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential election.  Officials say the new measures could be announced as early as Thursday, including targeting people close to President Putin. </p><p>VANIER:  CNN contributor and former Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty says the U.S. will likely take several different actions against Moscow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think there would basically be three.   </p><p>One is going to be sanctions, we expect.  And you would expect that that would be one thing.   </p><p>Number two would be some type of diplomatic action and number three would be the covert action.   </p><p>And the covert action, we might not even know that the United States is taking some action.  They can do it without warning.  The president has said previously that he would do it in his own time, but those are the three. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHURCH:  Moscow denies any role in the widespread hacking of U.S. political groups during the election.  Russia's foreign ministry warns it will retaliate if the U.S. takes any hostile steps. </p><p>VANIER:  A legend of old Hollywood dies the day after her daughter. We'll be remembering Debbie Reynolds -- next on CNN.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[01:30:00] VANIER:  I'm Cyril Vanier.   </p><p>CHURCH:  I'm Rosemary Church.   </p><p>Actress Debbie Reynolds has died at the age of 84, just one day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher.  Reynolds was one of the biggest stars in the world during the 1950s and '60s.   </p><p>VANIER:  Her starring turn in \"Singing in the Rain,\" one of Hollywood's most famous musicals, started a long career in the limelight.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(SINGING)  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VANIER:  Reynolds never stopped entertaining.  She once told CNN's Larry King her career gave her the fun of life.   </p><p>CHURCH:  She said when her marriages failed, entertainment stood by her.   </p><p>Stephanie Elam has more on the life and career of Debbie Reynolds.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>(SINGING) </p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Singer, dancer, actress -- Debbie Reynolds was a Hollywood triple threat and America's sweetheart.  Her film career began at the age of 16 after being spotted in a beauty pageant.   </p><p>(SINGING) </p><p>ELAM:  Her star officially launched a few years later after a spirited performance opposite Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor in 1952's \"Singing in the Rain.\"  </p><p>REYNOLDS:  They picked me to put me in \"Singing in the Rain\" and they locked me in a studio and, for three months, I had five teachers, one for tap, ballet, jazz, modern.  And I just worked, worked, worked until I'd just fall apart.   </p><p>(SINGING)  </p><p>ELAM:  Other notable roles followed, including 1957's \"Tammy and the Bachelor,\" which resulted in her number-one hit song \"Tammy.\"  She played opposite Gregory Peck in \"How the West was Won.\"  And her performance in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" earned her an Oscar nomination.   </p><p>(SINGING) </p><p>ELAM:  At times, Reynolds' life off-screen overshadowed her success. She had two children with her first husband, Crooner Eddie Fisher, Producer Todd Fisher and actress and author, Carrie Fisher.   In 1959, the marriage ended in a highly-publicized divorce when Fisher left Reynolds to marry her close friend, Elizabeth Taylor, a painful betrayal. </p><p>Reynolds was able to joke about the scandal years later.   </p><p>REYNOLDS:  I was a Girl Scout.  I was a simple little girl and that's what I was.  He fell madly in love with Elizabeth.  Now I understand so many years later.  And it's in the past.   </p><p>ELAM:  Her second and third marriages ended in divorce, each time causing Reynolds financial pain.  However, she had quietly been collecting Hollywood memorabilia over the years that would prove to be a wise investment.   </p><p>In 2011, Reynolds sold Marilyn Monroe's white subway dress at auction for $4.6 million.   </p><p>(SINGING) </p><p>ELAM: She also never quit performing.   </p><p>Though she stepped away from film much of her career, Reynolds continued to entertain on Broadway stages and in Las Vegas nightclubs.  </p><p>REYNOLDS:  All I need -- </p><p>ELAM:  In addition, Reynolds had several TV roles over the years, notably playing Liberace's mother in the 2013 Emmy-winning TV movie, \"Behind the Candelabra.\"  </p><p>Her wide array of work was recognized in 2015 when the Screen Actors Guild honored Reynolds with the Lifetime Achievement Award.   </p><p>(SINGING) </p><p>ELAM:  Reynolds says she loved every minute in show business.  In her 2013 autobiography, \"Unsinkable.\"  </p><p>She credited the love she had for her friends and family for her professional and personal resiliency.   </p><p>REYNOLDS:  I paid 20,000 bucks for this sucker.   </p><p>ELAM:  It is that spark and sense of humor, along with her talent, that Reynolds will be remembered for.   </p><p>REYNOLDS:  I love you.  Good night, everybody.  Thank you.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[01:37:02]  CHURCH:  Welcome back, everyone.  Donald Trump says the transition between his team and the Obama administration is going very smoothly.   VANIER:  That is very different from his tone on Twitter on Wednesday when he lashed out again at the current president.  Then came a phone call from Hawaii from the commander-in-chief himself.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He called me.  We had a very, very good talk about -- generally about things.  He was in Hawaii.  And it was a very, very nice call.  And I actually thought we covered a lot of territory.  A lot of good territory.   </p><p>VANIER:  Donald Trump and Mr. Obama have had a rocky relationship for years.  And things could change again before trump's inauguration next month. </p><p>CHURCH:  CNN's Sunlen Serfaty reports from Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President-elect Donald Trump night clearly attempting to lower the temperature, after early in the day, he escalated his spat with the president, tweeting today, quote, \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O. statements and roadblocks.  Thought it was going to be a smooth transition.  Not.\"   </p><p>All this coming after President Obama used his high-profile speech at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday to take a veiled jab at his successor.   </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Even when the hatred burns hottest, even the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward.  We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.   </p><p>SERFATY:  The escalating war of words between the out-going and in- coming president, a sharp departure from the immediate post-election vow to work together.   </p><p>OBAMA:  We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed.   </p><p>SERFATY:  With promises from both sides of a peaceful transfer of power.   </p><p>TRUMP:  I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.   </p><p>SERFATY:  But their relationship showing strains publicly.  Obama quipping he thinks he could have won the election if he could run again.   </p><p>OBAMA:  I'm confident that if I -- if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could have mobilized a majority of the American people to run behind it.   SERFATY:  Trump taunting him right back, tweeting, \"President Obama campaigned hard and personally in the important swing states and lost. The voters wanted to make American great again.\"   </p><p>And taking another swipe at the president, altering an Obama catchphrase, Trump talking in the third person, giving himself credit on the economy, tweeting, \"The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points, to 113.7, the highest level in more than 15 years, thanks, Donald.\"   </p><p>At Mar-a-Lago, today, Trump trying to focus on his own transition, receiving an intelligence briefing, meeting with his national security team and, according to transition officials, resuming meetings with potential members of his administration.   </p><p>(on camera):  And the White House has reacted to the phone call between President-elect Trump and President Obama, confirming it was President Obama who called Trump from Hawaii to have a discussion. The White House says it was a positive call, one focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition going forward.  And the White House says both sides recommitted to making sure they stay in communication in the next weeks ahead.   </p><p>Sunlen Serfaty, CNN, Palm Beach, Florida. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)   </p><p>[01:40:35]  VANIER:  All right, we're going to have a discuss of our own with the vice chair of the California Democratic Party, Eric Bauman; and Republican strategist, Luis Alvarado.   </p><p>Many substantive issues thrown up daily in this profession, the economy and foreign relations.   </p><p>Let's start with the economy, gentlemen.  And listen to what Donald Trump had to say when it was announced that Sprint would bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have some very good news, because of what is happening and the spirit and the hope.  I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States.  They are taking them from other countries and they're bringing them back to the United States.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>Luis Alvarado, Republican strategist, seriously, do you think Donald Trump can take credit for thousands of jobs being created in the U.S. before he is even in office?   </p><p>LUIS ALVARADO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Let's be specific, Donald Trump's claim was he received a phone call from Sprint, not that he initiated the phone call.   And there is something to say about Wall Street, is all about giving the sense of prosperity versus giving the sense of negativity.  And Donald Trump does have an effect.  Up to this point, no one can argue that the effect that was expected to be one of calamity has turned into an effect of prosperity.  And that sense of prosperity sticks with Donald Trump.   </p><p>And the reality is that the Democrat Party only has one spokesperson that still has the credibility throughout the Democratic Party and that is Barack Obama.  And the question is the void that is going to exist for the entire party --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>VANIER:  That is a powerful spokesperson one might argue.  He's president. </p><p>ALVARADO:  But soon will be silenced.  And the question is, how will he continue to represent the issue or the ideology of the Democratic Party?  Will he have a platform or will someone else step up to the plate.  Because the Republicans have their spokesperson, regardless if you like him or not.  He has a very loud voice being heard throughout the world.   </p><p>VANIER:  Eric Bauman? </p><p>ERIC BAUMAN, VICE CHAIR, CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY:  I'm not sure I understand that last point.  Barack Obama will be the immediate past president and will continue to speak out on issues across the board, just as Bill Clinton has done.  And Bill Clinton left office with a very high approval rating and the best economy we had seen in years. And Barack Obama is leaving office with a markedly approved economy and 60 percent approval rating.   </p><p>The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump cannot take credit for any of this.  This is the net result of years of digging out of the economic hole we were in in 2008, rebuilding slowly.  And the problem is that there are places across America where the recovery just never touched and never got there.  And I don't think the 5,000 purported jobs that they're bringing back is the solution to the problem.  I think we have a lot of work to go, because here's the bottom line, there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who don't have skills for high-tech and academic-based and professional careers, and there's not enough work for them in America.  And we've got to figure that problem out. </p><p>CHURCH:  Gentlemen, I want to shift to foreign policy, if we can, because very much front and center right now, particularly the relationship between the United States and Russia and the relationship between the United States and Israel.  Observers very concerned about where it stands right now and where it will go once Donald Trump takes office on January 20th.   </p><p>Starting with you, Eric, it's going to be quite a shift, very different.  We're seeing the olive branch very much being offered from Donald Trump to Russia, and that has many people very nervous.   BAUMAN:  Well, amazingly, it has not just Democrats nervous, but it has Republicans in leadership very, very nervous because people have not forgotten the Cold War.  People understand that Putin is not a guy to have as a friend.  He's not an honest broker.  He is a very dangerous man and that is the reason why Trump's approach and his secretary of state designate are so dangerous for our nation because they are playing right into Putin's hands and making Putin look stronger on the world stage.   </p><p>CHURCH:  Luis, your reaction there?   </p><p>[13:45:09]  ALVARADO:  So far, Donald Trump has been -- for over a year, said that he will not be capable of doing X, Y, and Z, and the reality is we have to give him the opportunity to demonstrate to those that supported him and voted for him that he will be effective and that his plan will work.  And when he has that loud voice and that little bit of a sense of not understanding what -- how the effect will be measured, I think that gives him an advantage to actually think out of the box, act out of the box, and do it on behalf of the American people.  And we are all hoping, Democrats and Republican, that he is successful.  And I think that is one thing we can get behind the president.   </p><p>VANIER:  We will be watching very close.   </p><p>Luis Alvarado, Eric Bauman, many thanks to you.   </p><p>BAUMAN:  Thank you. </p><p>CHURCH:  Unfortunately, we'll have to end it there.  Appreciate it.   </p><p>VANIER:  We're going to take a short break on CNN.  When we come back, could Amazon's Echo device help solve a murder case.   </p><p>CHURCH:  One prosecutor thinks it can.  But find out why Amazon is not ready to turn over all the data. </p><p>Back in a moment.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(WEATHER REPORT) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[01:50:02]  CHURCH:  A popular piece of technology is at the center of a murder investigation in the United States.  A prosecutor in Arkansas wants access to recordings from an Amazon Echo device that was in a House where a man was killed.   </p><p>VANIER:  But Amazon is pushing back, refusing to turn over some of the data connected to the murder suspect's account.  And the case is renewing the debate about technology and privacy.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY CEVALLOS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  People are concerned because it's something that actively listens 24 hours a day.  But there are a lot of things -- technology and data has been convicting people for a long time.  The information in your computer can be subject to a search warrant and all kinds of crime exist on computers or your phone or anything else.  The thing that makes this a new sort of era is that no one turns on the Echo, it is always listening.  And when you activate it, it sends that information to be translated out in the Cloud, the data, it returns back to your home and then it acts on those commands. And that's what has people concerned.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHURCH:  Now the defendant's attorney is applauding Amazon.  She says there is nothing useful on that device.   </p><p>So, Attorney Areva Martin joins us from Los Angeles with her take on the case.   </p><p>I want to start with, for a lot of us with this in our homes, it's disconcerting to know and learn it is listening all of the time.  It is like a recording ongoing in our homes.  That's disconcerting.  But how is this any different to when there's an investigation and they want data from a phone to help find out what happened in this case?   </p><p>AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY:  The district attorney says it is no different than having a legal search warrant for your phone or computer records. And Amazon's position is not supported by the law or the legal precedent.  And now the district attorney has to make a decision.  The warrant has been issued.  Amazon has been willing to release account information, but not the recordings on the Echo.  So, the district attorney in this case will have to decide if it's going the go into court and challenge Amazon and ask a court to intervene and force Amazon to release the data.   </p><p>CHURCH:  And how likely is it that that would happen?  Because obviously, from a pure business point of view, Amazon has to take a stand and say, no, we won't be handing this over but if this does proceed, legally, they would be forced to, right?   </p><p>MARTIN:  We saw this happen in the San Bernardino case in the terrorist case of 2015 when the iPhone was involved and law enforcement wanted to force Apple to unlock the iPhone, and they resisted.  A third party got involved and unlocked the data in that case.  These cases provide a challenge for big tech companies like Amazon and Apple.  They want to protect their clients and want their clients to feel a sense of privacy with the data on the Cloud, and that comes up against law enforcement who says we may need the information to solve a crime like in this case in Arkansas.  And the courts will have to decide, is it an individual's right to privacy versus the government's right to have access to what could be vital information for a crime such as murder.   </p><p>CHURCH:  Given your background, of course, where do you think this is going?  How do you think this will end up?   MARTIN:  Ultimately, I think the courts will intervene in a case like this, and Amazon and tech companies will be forced to turn over this information.  This information is really no different than that information that is stored on a computer, telephone records, other information, which the government, upon the showing of probable cause, has the right to access.  Whether it's your home, car, computer or, in this case, your electronic personal assistant, I think, ultimately, the government is going to have access to that information.   </p><p>CHURCH:  Of course, what we're seeing play out here is that technology is moving way past what we have there in the law.  So, something has to be done.  Are there moves afoot to do something to create laws and restrictions and regulations so that it is easier for courts to sort through this?   </p><p>MARTIN:  Rosemary, what you said is 100 percent accurate.  The technology is moving so quickly the law is having a hard time keeping pace with it.  But ultimately, I think these decisions will be pretty easy.  Information like this that's stored on electronic personal assistants will be subject to the same subpoena disclosure requirements as computer information, telephone information and similar information.  For us, as consumers, we have to decide, when we bring a device like this in our home, we should be aware that information is being stored on the Cloud.  And it's not just a subpoena from law enforcement, but also potential hacking that can happen with this information.  So, our convenience has to be weighed against our desire to keep information private.   </p><p>And I happen to be one of those lucky people who received one of these devices for a Christmas gift.  And millions of people across the country and world will have to decide what do we want to say to our personal assistant and in saying it what are we subjecting ourselves to in doing so?   </p><p>[01:55:37]  CHURCH:  A very good point.  I have one as well, and this has been an education to me and, I'm sure, many other people across the world who have access to these.  We have to work out what we're doing.   </p><p>MARTIN:  Right. </p><p>All right, a pleasure to talk to you, Areva Martin.  Thank you so much joining us from Los Angeles -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Thank you. </p><p>CHURCH:  -- where it is nearly 11:00 at night.  Appreciate it.   </p><p>VANIER:  We're going the take a short break on CNN NEWSROOM.  But first, we want to update you on the breaking news, the death of Actress Debbie Reynolds.
