In this roundtable, President, Andrew Mathias; to his left, CFO, Matthew DiLiberto; and Executive Vice President, Director of Leasing &amp; Real Property, Steve Durels; and Anastasia Verghis, Head of Investor Relations. So the spirit of these panels really is a larger meeting, so please feel free to chime in (inaudible). But if you have follow-up questions on anything you have, definitely chime in. We want to make sure (inaudible).</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So I guess just starting out, frustrating performance in the stock over the last 12 months. I know you guys are taking steps to try to fix the problem, create value through buying back shares. Just -- when you guys come in the office every day, talk about the level of frustration and talk about the things you think you could do that -- to change things, or just kind of expand and pass it around.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: Well, I would say, we're first and foremost a real estate company, not a stock company. So the vast majority of our 300 people are focused on executing our business plan, which is running on all cylinders right now, on the leasing side, on the development side, on construction, and then on also obviously, the accounting and balance sheet side. So we sit in a New York City market that is very healthy for the most part with an upward revisions in jobs, private sector jobs for 2019, which I don't think -- we didn't expect, I don't think the city itself expected, a healthy investment sales market where we've seen a lot of transaction activity this year and a lot of different buyer groups emerging for assets like 540 Madison, retail assets like 711 Fifth Avenue, a very varied group of assets. And a leasing market, which continues to show a lot of strength in all the different sectors, particularly TAMI, which is getting a lot of the headlines but also financials, education, health care and government.</p><p>So we're operating in a very healthy market, and our job as managers is to keep our people focused on creating value and sort of executing SL Green's business as opposed to keeping their eye on the screen and judging themselves from the stock price, which we've been operating in a market now for about 4-plus years where the stock price has been completely divorced from our view of underlying asset value, and now it's in the markets prevailing view of asset value. So we're sticking to our strategy, executing it. We've communicated that clearly to investors, and we'll continue to take advantage of spot market. Real estate prices and buying in stock to the authorization where the Board is currently out, which is $2.5 billion of total program and potentially beyond [reversal signal].</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So should have actually started with any message you wanted to pass along. I got a little excited, it's my first roundtable today. So with your prepared remarks, you wanted to get across and you did a good job answering (inaudible). Anything you wanted to say (inaudible).</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: No. I mean that I think wanted to just give an overview of the market -- investment sales market, the leasing market. And the one thing I didn't touch on is our development pipeline where we're really focusing a lot of our time, attention and capital. Obviously, One Vanderbilt, steel will top out this month, curtain wall complete in December, and we're on track and ahead of schedule from our initial time line for TCL August of 2020. So we have turned over space in the bottom of the building to tenants who have begun their buildouts. And again, the doors will open next August.</p><p>On the heels of that, we have foundations well in process, of 185 Broadway just up the street here. On our first 70/30 affordable residential deal. Developments in full swing at 460 West 34th Street, which we just closed on in May. And we're deep, deep in planning on 1 Madison, where we'll be completely transforming that building after Cr\u00e9dit Suisse leaves at the end of 2020. So a lot of exciting plans and a lot of profitable action on the development side, I guess, was the other thing we wanted to communicate.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: I know it's the smallest of the parts that you mentioned, but what are your background of any -- what changes in with the rent control (inaudible) in underwriting the outlook?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: There is no change. They did exempt affordable New York from the changes they made in rent regulation. So we're still 30% affordable and 70% market rate without any type of rent restrictions. So the underwriting there is intact.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And there's been a lot of press activity about the big leases roaming around the 34th Street area west side, both in new construction and new (inaudible) projects. Can you guys talk about leasing pipeline, just generally for New York but also that part of the market and just kind of help with (inaudible) what you're seeing across the submarket?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; DIRECTOR OF LEASING &amp; REAL PROPERTY, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: Well, start with the fact that from our perspective, we had probably one of the busiest summers from a leasing perspective that I can recall for many years. It was -- we've got a huge pipeline right now of almost 1 million square -- 1.4 million square feet with over 950,000 square feet of leases that are actually in the document negotiation as we sit here today. We've signed leases of over 1.1 million square feet against the year-end target of 1.5 million. So we feel comfortable that we'll achieve that goal and exceed it. And when you break it down by industry, what we're seeing, which I think is a reflection of what the overall marketing is experiencing, has been a big drive year-to-date from the FIRE sector, from financial and insurance in particular.</p><p>But what's in the pipeline right now is it -- are the TAMI tenants. We've said to many investors on conversations over the past several months that we had a -- we did a tour of the West Coast at the beginning of the year. And the feedback that we had from that was that every large tech tenant that we met with, every brand name that all of us would know communicated to us that they were coming into New York City in a very big way. And you're starting to see that, whether that's Google or Microsoft or Facebook or some of the other big names are out there, all these guys are turning their attention to the East Coast because it's gotten too pricey on the West Coast. The housing is too pricey, the competition for talent is too difficult. And what we heard from them very clearly was East Coast is our new focus. We're not coming in a small way, we're coming in a big way. It's no longer about these little boutique buildings down in Chelsea where we think 10,000 square feet and make it work because it's cool. They're going to need big buildings with big infrastructure, and you're seeing that borne out by some of the big deals that are in the market right now. Facebook's negotiating a big lease over in Hudson Yards. We heard the other day that they put another proposal out in the market for another 700,000 square feet in addition to that.</p><p>And then there are other names that I can't really rattle off because we're under nondisclosure agreements with some of these guys. But they were all knocking on our door as well, taking a look at 1 Madison Avenue. We're actively trading paper with a couple of tenants of size for that building. No promises as to whether we sign a deal in the near term, but I think it's a good barometer of as we sit here in 2019 for a project that doesn't deliver until the third quarter of 2023, that we are engaged with tenants who need big footprints, and 1 Madison is a unique product in the right part of town and has all the bells and whistles that these guys are looking for.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So it's -- and when I think about that a lot, I mean you guys have -- I mean it's a great deal in a great location but there's not 1 million square foot potential expansion next door when one of these big tech tenants decide that they need the next building. And I assume that's the attraction of having the leasing in the Hudson Yards and in the [west sides]. It's a long pipe. As much as we say the drag on New York City is the pipeline, the benefit to attract I think a lot of these tenants is the potential pipeline of new product with good infrastructure that we're talking about.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, I think what you've seen -- what Hudson Yards has proven to all of us is that tenants will sacrifice location for the benefits of new construction or heavily redeveloped buildings. And you've seen that's where the disproportionate amount of the leasing is taking place for large blocks of space this year. We saw it last year as well. But Hudson Yards as a new neighborhood is driven not by the convenience of the neighborhood and not by the cool factor of the neighborhood; there was nothing there to begin with. It's because that's where the product was. And these tenants who need large blocks of space, they want the benefits in new construction. That's not just infrastructure, that's high ceilings and big windows and natural daylight and [concrete] floors and all -- everything else that supports the operation of their business.</p><p>So when you look at a building like 1 Madison Avenue, we have that. We're 1.4 million square feet at the end of the day. We're in a neighborhood that has other buildings surrounding it. But we have, like, new construction of the building. One Vanderbilt has proven the thesis as well, right? It's -- so when everybody had these headlines of the world is shifted to the West side, that was a false statement. That's because the product was there. They came back to Midtown proper with One Vanderbilt Avenue. As we sit here today, 59% leased. They're still a year away from completing the building, where tenants didn't want or weren't prepared to sacrifice location and weren't prepared to pay the rents necessary to be in Midtown proper in the convenience of great transportation.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: I would also say, if you look at Google and their \"campus\", which is actually Chelsea Market and then all the way down to St. John's terminal, tenants are willing to stretch the definition of directly adjacent expansion space to be on subway lines or quickly commutable back and forth. So I don't think 1 Madison will be constrained at all by the surrounding product. We own 11 Madison Avenue just 1 block north, which has a significant amount of square footage, albeit all leased. And I think tenants will see expansion possibilities in the future in that neighborhood.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: (inaudible) [had an interesting lunch with R C Stacum] yesterday. I didn't realize, but [she had] said both Google and Disney, a big part of their decision go to that area was for the cable, the [thing] of the dark fiber, which I did not know. So that's -- I assume move more companies to go down there to get more access to that?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Yes, I mean, I think that fiber runs all on that spine. So...</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: But as you guys think about the next (inaudible) in New York City and where things are going, and we've got the Midtown East on the plan. There's a pretty good article about a week ago, (inaudible) that were saying how it's working. I assume you do like, as you guys think about planning the portfolio, you want to have more aggregated locations where you can -- like I mean BofA right now is a good case in point. They've got our building right across the street. They're taking more space and it's walkable. So I agree with you. You can be there by subway. But it just seems like that's where everyone is heading. Do you think that as we look at SL Green in the future that's -- the direction the company will be heading and the portfolio can be heading, and you just kind of pick your nodes in all neighborhoods?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Well, I guess, I mean, we are neighborhood focused for sure on Grand Central. As far as Midtown East rezoning is concerned, we don't have any other buildings right now where the occupancy profile kind of lines up for our redevelopment that would be economically viable even with the upzoning. So we don't expect to see a lot of new supply coming on in Midtown as a result of the rezoning because like a lot of owners are looking sort of the same economics we're looking at. One Vanderbilt was a special project with particular rezoning and a bunch of other ancillary businesses that kind of make that project viable, but I don't see demolishing a lot of our other existing inventory.</p><p>But we are geographically focused for sure, and with One Vanderbilt, we've leased a tenant in One Vanderbilt. We've also taken space in other buildings we own in the area to support that front office operation. That's been a very successful strategy for us. So we'll continue to concentrate ownership in that area.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Maybe can we just talk about what the demand pipeline actually looks like in full in Midtown, and then studying specifically One Vanderbilt. Any changes as your leasing projects approach year-end?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: No, I think, as we sit here today, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll meet our target for the year. We're -- as I said earlier, we're 59% leased. We have other leases in negotiation. Hopefully, those close when they sign this year, that they'll put us over the goal line or at the goal line for the 65% target for the year. And we've got proposals on the table with another 4, 5 tenants. Everybody that's looking at the building today are financial service businesses. I mean we've done leasing to date with law firms, financial service and some public real estate firms. But everybody that's in the pipeline today are financial services. And we're trading paperworks at both the bottom of the building and in the penthouse of the building as well.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: What do you have left to lease this quarter?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: It's spread around. The biggest chunk there is 2 base floors, 15 to 16 floors, that's about 90,000 square feet. And then we've got a smattering of floors in the midrise, and then we've got 8 of the 9 penthouse floors left.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: (inaudible)</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: They range anywhere between 140 in the base and then into mid-ish 200s for 1 or 2 floors at the very top. Most of it's in the 150 to 180 range.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And then what are your latest thoughts on the observatory?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Yes, plan's proceeding. The escalators are in the space. I mean it's spectacular physical space, and we continue to see big demand for the type of attractions we're going to offer directly connected to Grand Central, so we're very excited to bring it online. But everything's still proceeding according to plan.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: I'll add to that because I took a group up the other day. And when Andrew says it's amazing physical space, that's -- he's understating it. It is an extraordinary experience to be on those floors with these super high ceilings and oversized windows and a view that allows you to look directly down onto Times Square and Bryant Park in the center of Manhattan. It's -- it really hits you in the gut, it's great, great observatory space.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Do you guys still feel comfortable with your original NOI projection for the observatory?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Yes.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: So when do you think we'll start to see a more detailed plan? Investor Day?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: I don't know if Investor Day, there's going to be much more to unveil. We haven't sort of -- we haven't hashed that out yet. But certainly, as we get into next year, there'll be more detailed plans and some early marketing.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: When do you think would go?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: What is our...</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO, CFO, SL GREEN REALTY CORP.: It's probably the late -- a year after TCL. Late '21.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Any questions from the room?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just taking one step back to your original comments, Andrew, about the stock not aligned exactly with what you've delivered over the last 4 years. I guess just from a strategy-forward level, how do you think about that for -- I mean how long if that continues? Is it next year or the next few years? What are some of the thoughts there on how to close that?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Well, I think the Board is pretty resolute in the fact that we can control what we can control and, obviously, can't control the stock price. So we have what we believe to be a very sound business strategy, a very conservative financial strategy only using proceeds from sales to delever and to buy back stock. And we feel like we've significantly improved the company and the balance sheet and really that the remaining holdings with the sales we've made to date. So we continue to view it as a market opportunity, I would say. And although we'd love to see shareholders rewarded with higher stock price, obviously, the dividend continues to be very healthy. And we view it more as a market opportunity or business opportunity, really unique business opportunity that's persisted rather than sort of a -- something that has to be addressed in some kind of emergency manner because we don't think we can control it.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: I think Marc commented at the Investor Day that the -- taking the company private, like just -- you can't do a deal of that size of taking the company private. Is there a threshold you guys think about that would be the right size of a deal and getting it done?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: I mean it's not something we're really measuring day-by-day. So I don't know the threshold size. But certainly, we're still of a scale that we think it would be -- it's a very large check to take the company private.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: On revisions (inaudible) today and how you think about the (inaudible)?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Sure. We have a slide on that.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Yes, for those who have decks in front of you, we do have a new SG section towards the back and it actually lays out a time line for some of the new regulations. I mean really, I mean just...</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: It's on Page 44.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: 44. So basically, through 2029 or beyond 2029, there hasn't been -- the rules haven't been established. So we're actually part of a group of (inaudible) parties involved in evaluating what happens after 2029. Between now and 2023, there is no impact at all. And then beyond that, we're essentially in compliance today. Long and short is if we didn't do anything to the portfolio today through 2029, it would cost us a few hundred thousand dollars. That's it.</p><p>We have been extraordinarily proactive, that's also highlighted through these slides, in making our portfolio sustainable and being at the leading edge of the green initiatives for probably 10 years. We have a group of 5 professionals under -- and taken each step, oversee that initiative, the vast majority of our portfolio is -- are already LEED certified or ENERGY STAR certified. We have our scores here across all of the most relevant sustainability grading scores, and we submit to virtually all of them. We have either tied or outright the best scores there. We've been ahead of this. I think the new regulations are probably much more onerous for those who have not been trying to upgrade and redevelop their portfolios and get ahead of this. They may be facing some more significant financial burden over the next 11, 12 years. But for us, we're looking more beyond 2029 and what the impact might be, and we are part of that conversation determining what the new rules will be.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Any questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: One follow-up on the original conversation on the tech tenants that Jamie talked about on his panel this morning. One of the popular questions we get is just the health of the tech companies and if the recession does hit. And again, our panel this morning kind of highlighted low probability of recession to Steve Roth commenting no recession ever again. But how do you think -- I guess how do you -- when you're thinking about these tech firms first, obviously, big differences of the early 2000s. But can they continue to plow through even if there is a pullback in the economy and continue to lease?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, I think it's a different profile tech tenant that's in the market today than it was 5, 10, 15 years ago. It is by and large the ones that I'm referring to that are migrating from the West Coast to the East Coast of size. These are not startup businesses. These are well-established, big brand-name companies, highly profitable firms. And they're the top companies in the world. So that wasn't historically the tech industry in New York City. That's -- I think that's a big headline change for New York City over the past couple of years where when you see Google, right, Google came to New York City. We all take Google for granted today and say, of course, they're here. But when they first came to New York City, they had a satellite office. And then over the past 10 years, they've grown to be a gigantic force within the marketplace. And you're seeing all of their peer group doing the same thing.</p><p>So whether that's Facebook and Amazon, or East Coast firms like IBM and -- or Netflix, they're all big, well-established companies, not like we saw at prior years where they were small boutique startups funded by VC capital. That suggests -- I mean those firms are there, but they're not the drivers in the marketplace.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: What we're hearing consistently is that the talent is in New York City and Boston, and that's where the people of these firms have to hire are locating themselves after engineering school, after college. So the companies feel like they have to be here, and they're going to spend what they have to spend in order to really scale up here. They have access to that talent because they can't access it in the West Coast and Silicon Valley any longer.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Maybe just one follow-up from the -- our econ panel this morning. Our strategist was commenting on, again, a question of recessions and pullbacks that usually starts with corporations freezing, holding on decisions. And we just want to make sure we ask each company at the conference, have you seen any change in the last week, month, 2 months with these macro risks and trade rhetoric rising? Anything, any change in the last couple months from just a leasing standpoint rhetoric conversation?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: We haven't any kind of pullback or any kind of pause on negotiations based on trade headlines or otherwise. If anything, I think rates have been fueling growth and, obviously, the rates have trended down significantly. So that's made companies more apt to make capital decisions and commit for longer terms.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Then maybe on Amazon. Do you think that they'll still wind up taking all the space they were looking for in Queens, but in Manhattan? How do you think that plays out?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: I think it's to be seen. They're clearly growing in Manhattan. So whatever they were going to do in Queens, that requirements or some portion of that requirement is going to shift to Manhattan. Whether it's the same footprint or not, I couldn't tell you. But they're not shying away from being in Manhattan and they're clearly on a growth path.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And maybe -- sorry, one last on the recession [we put out or recession read] reports and look to historical and never love to just look at historical point of view but office -- the office sector, where the data exists historically has been the most volatile. So I mean I asked you to come out with a view on what could be different. Unfortunately for office, we said probably not different. But if you have a view to, at the end of the day, agree or disagree?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Leverage levels are much lower this time around, you would have to say. So...</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Yes, we did consider that. But NOI standpoint, just from the nature of the business.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: We have the longest -- among the longest or if not, the longest average lease term in the business here in New York and on our portfolio in particular. So we feel like we have a very solid credit portfolio with long lease terms that sort of ride through economic cycles, and we have a very conservative leverage profile. So that's supposed to lead to less volatility and recession. Obviously, you have market fluctuations that are -- capital flows that you can't really control, but we do feel like we're positioned very defensively at this point for any type of eventuality.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Yes. Just add to that, [Jeff], because you're referring to historical data. If you look at our historical same-store NOI growth for 20 years, we have the highest average of any of the office REITs over that duration. Being in New York provides us an advantage along with the long lease terms that Andrew highlighted. Our occupancy has never been below 94%, so we keep it full. And the leases in New York provide protections, right? We are insulated against expense increases and the leases generally provide for rent escalations over time.</p><p>So even in a downturn, if you have a full portfolio with low lease roll and leases that provide the expense protection and rent growth, you can even maintain positive same-store NOI growth in a recessionary environment, and that's what we've shown. So 4%, 20-year average same-store NOI growth is what we enjoy, and that's in part as a result as being so concentrated in New York and the leases that we have here.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Just a remark about this morning talking about just Wall Street job cuts, potentially job cuts coming and they talk about Goldman (inaudible) they talk about overall it's been a very slow year for (inaudible). Steve, as you think about the footprint of the investment -- of the big banks, would you see material job cuts out of New York City hiding the impacts of [volume] in terms of how the [condos] footprints look today and how much excess capacity you think they have?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, I don't hear that a lot of them are sitting on extraordinary amount of excess space the way we've talked about in prior cycles where there was a lot of shadow space. Certainly, if there are job cuts, then that'll obviously have a dampening effect on the leasing environment. But one of the silver linings of densification for these, whether it's financial firms or all industries that have migrated to more open plan work environments and densified their occupancy of their employees, it becomes increasingly harder for those types of businesses to divide their spaces and take some of that space to the sublease market, as opposed to when there is various departments and they can sort of segregate them off and say, okay, I'm going to lease half that floor or this is part of my space. Now a lot of businesses are just kind of crunched into one envelope of space. And it's tougher for them to take space to the sublease market. So we don't have a lot of competition on the direct space competing in a sublease space.</p><p>But having said that, I don't hear a lot of firms sitting on excess space, just the (inaudible) that came out over the last recession how people manage their real estate. People -- firms are leasing space as they need it as opposed to leasing space proactively warehousing it and hoping that they grow into it. I just don't see that as much as we did in prior cycles.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And Matt, how do you think about your current leverage and any appetite on taking them lower for any kind of (inaudible)?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: No appetite to take it lower. We're 44% LTV, and that's where we expect to stay. I know there's a lot of people who want to use debt-to-EBITDA. And I've kept my debt-to-EBITDA soapbox up in the conference room. Anastasia said don't bring it down and kill too much time. But look, when we are buying back stock, which is debt-to-EBITDA negative and doing development that is debt-to-EBITDA detrimental, the exercise of maintaining leverage neutrality in an LTV basis while executing those things is challenging enough. That is our target. That's our goal, is to maintain leverage neutrality at LTVs that are by private market standards, too low, by public market standards, I think, prudent. And we're going to continue to execute the asset sale share buyback program and the redevelopment projects with that thought in mind.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: We've seen the private markets continue to push up the amount of leverage they're using on acquisitions, given the rate environment. I think some of the bids we're entertaining on our own assets where we see institutional capital with a higher tolerance for 65% to 70% leverage financing themselves quite a bit more than what used to be sort of the core buyers, who are more in the 55% to 60% range are now pushing up and using more leverage, taking advantage of low rates, I would say, either make their returns or to -- depending on how you look at it, to increase their returns.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And then, I guess, heading into (inaudible). Just as we think about -- there are a lot of -- there are moving pieces to your same-store this year with 1515 Broadway and there are some moving pieces next year, end of next year with 625. Can you just talk about the building blocks of the same-store or even earnings in '20 on some of the big chunks that you've given an indication about?</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: It's approaching year. It's not December yet though, right, Jamie? Next thing you know, we'll be answering your question. So look, we're going to come out in December with our 2020 guidance. I think the -- what we're going to be highlighting, and I think it's this -- is the growth even beyond 2020. That's what I think people need start to focus on is we'll be getting a lot of attention around whether that's Polo vacating or what's going to happen when we take 1 Madison offline. The sooner the better that we get CS out of the way and we can commence the redevelopment.</p><p>This is all staging for growth in -- over the next 5 years, not the next 1. So we'll go through December, the building blocks, the things that are coming online nearer term, like 609 Fifth, where PUMA just opened last month. If you haven't been over there, go check it out. It's pretty spectacular. And the office space should come online middle of next year. One Vanderbilt to start to come on late next year, but we're staging the company right now for the next 5 years, not just the next 1, One Vanderbilt, 1 Madison, 185, all the projects that Andrew highlighted.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: And certainly, at the investor conference, the focus will be on illuminating sort of that NOI bridge over the next 3 to 5 years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible)</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: I don't know total square foot, but we have 2 installations with that. So we have 609 Fifth where they have about 150,000 square feet or so. That's their co-working space. They're building that out now. It should open middle of next year. And then we have their enterprise business at 2 Herald that's fully leased to Amazon currently.</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: We'll probably grow the footprint a little bit incrementally. But we put them in the context of our exposure to the co-working industry as a whole because we're very -- sort of to the earlier conversation about how we manage the portfolio on the risk perspective, it's not just the length of the leases but it's the credit profile. It's not having too much exposure on any one industry as well. So we are very conscientious about not having -- being overexposed in the co-working industry. We think they're valuable to have a part of our portfolio, but with a very modest exposure, in the single digits.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Can you talk about market brand growth? Any thoughts on where we are in manufactured brands year-to-date or within maybe upsell market?</p><p>STEVEN M. DURELS: Well, my own view is that I think it's much as we said at the beginning of the year where rents have been growing modestly, 3% to 4%, we think net effectiveness have modestly been increasing as well as concessions have stabilized. So if concessions have stabilized and face rents are increasing, there's a net effective growth. We're seeing it in our portfolio. It's not enough to shout it from the top of the mountain, but it's certainly a positive.</p><p>And with all of the health of the overall economy, the strength of the job market, if you're -- have a macro view that things are going to continue to be on solid footing, with the increased demand particularly from the tech tenants, the fundamentals would tell you that's more material rent growth has to be off in the not-too-distant future. But I don't think we're at a point we're going to predict that as we sit here today.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And then the D&amp;PE book, can you just maybe talk about where you're trending versus your guidance? And any opportunities for you (inaudible) in the investments?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Sure. I mean I think that market is extremely healthy and competitive. A lot of big deals getting done. And I'd say, we're participating in our fair share or probably less so than at prior times because of the capital focus on stock buyback. So we are, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, letting that book roll down a bit and taking some payoffs. Those payoffs are coming in as anticipated, if not a little bit ahead of schedule as borrowers take advantage of frothy refinancing conditions. So we continue to see that book rightsizing a bit as we continue to focus our capital on stock buyback. But we still want to maintain our market share and, obviously, participate in our fair share of deals, which we've done this year.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Book balance probably below our initial guidance by the end of the year.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: We were $1 billion...</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: We said down 100; we'll be down by more. Yes. Probably between $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And do you see -- is there a structural change in the market that (inaudible) up again or it just happened to be lower rates or...</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: No, it's lower rates. I mean it's just lower rates. We're absolutely return investors and we're comparing it against what we view as an absolute return on our stock buyback program. So as rates have fallen and the markets -- debt markets have continued to stay very competitive, that breakeven to stock buyback is getting very close on a lot of deals. And we'd rather invest in our equity overall than invest in the debt book.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: Okay. Any other topics that you want to address? All right. So just to wrap up here. Our fire -- our rapid fire questions here. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's U.S. economists now estimate 1 of 3 chance in the recession on the next 12 months. Are you and your board discussing recession more during recent meetings, the same as earlier in the year, or not at all?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: The same as earlier in the year.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: With macro rates rising, are you seeing any signs of a slowdown or pullback from your tenants in the last couple of months?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: We have not seen any slowdown or pullback, and there's no talk of tariffs or other macro issues impacting our portfolio thus far.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: And then finally, which of the following sectors do you think can surprise expectations the most for being defensive in the next recession? Industrial, retail, office or residential?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: That's a loaded question.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Office.</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Our first 3 top choices are office.</p><p>MATTHEW J. DILIBERTO: Office, office, office.</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: If the top 3 choices are industrial, retail and residential, what would you say?</p><p>ANDREW W. MATHIAS: Well, I don't know if would be a surprise. I would say industrial, but...</p><p>JAMES COLIN FELDMAN: All right. Great. Thank you all very much.</p><p>ANDREW W.

It risks losing precious focus in a highly time-compressed format, and it offers the executives themselves the opportunity to obfuscate and hide behind each other.</p><p>In truth, each one of these chief executives would probably deserve a week of forensic questioning on specific areas of their corporate activity. </p><p>But the high commissions charged to third party developers on Apple's app store is an entirely different issue to the market dominance of Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing arm, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/0/will-2020-olympics-held-will-team-gb-athletes-not-able-take/\">or the stranglehold over digital advertising enjoyed by Google and Facebook</url>, or the issues around <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/0/will-2020-olympics-held-will-team-gb-athletes-not-able-take/\">data mining and privacy linked to the growing popularity of home voice assistants like Alexa</url>.</p><p>Instead, well briefed by the world's most expensive lawyers and PR experts and with only about an hour each in the spotlight, it's probable that slick operators like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook will ooze charm and bat away most questions with ease.</p><p>In the event of awkward or difficult moments they will probably opt to keep cool and play for time-always the best defence for live-streamed events of this kind where a good TV performance often turns more on style than substance.</p><p> Indeed, the real pressure will be on the panel members to use the time effectively and to show they are properly across the brief and capable of asking challenging questions.</p><p>In similar past hearings, it has sometimes been the lawmakers rather than those being questioned who have been put on the spot.</p><p>Remember when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/0/will-2020-olympics-held-will-team-gb-athletes-not-able-take/\">Mark Zuckerberg last appeared before a Congressional hearing in 2018</url>, and some of the panellists were clearly ill-prepared? </p><p>\"Senator, we run ads,\" Zuckerberg responded with a smirk, when 84-year-old Republican Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, asked how Facebook could sustain a business model in which its services were free.</p><p>\"I see. That's great,\" was Hatch's red-faced response.</p><p>Politicians around the world-including in the UK-have repeatedly shown themselves to be ill equipped to ask the kind of probing questions necessary to elicit valuable or insightful answers.</p><p>Like Britain's CMA, which recently published a final report from a year long review of digital markets which was as vague and ineffectual as it sounds, regulators and politicians need to learn that the very real competition concerns raised by these companies are difficult to compare and highly specific.</p><p>We need more detailed work on specific areas-not broad brush criticism of the entire industry.</p><p>Of course, there is always the chance the hearing could surprise with a revealing moment or an insightful exchange.</p><p>If the panellists fail, then-like athletes at the Olympic Games-it will be a squandered opportunity for them and for the rest of us.</p><p>In agreeing to appear this month, Bezos, Zuckerberg et al will have a powerful argument that they should not have to do so again for an extended period-probably three or four years. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64284352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609S-H651-JCJY-G2DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But nobody is happy to live with the consequences of consuming the product; they know smoking cigarettes is bad for health. The other aspect is that while they are using the product, they don't want to have a negative impact on the people around them.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Olczak adds that many people would like to quit smoking but are unable to see it through.</p><p>To be sure, this struggle to quit and the heightened public awareness of the harmful effects of smoking aren't new. Philip Morris - and its Big Tobacco peers - have been the subject of restrictive legislation from governments and criticism from health organisations for years.</p><p>So why choose now to stub out what has, for decades, raked in tons of profit for the company? Well, Philip Morris reckons it has something better to offer consumers. Against the backdrop of a steady decline in global smoking rates, the company has been aggressively pushing out its heated tobacco product IQOS in more than 40 markets.</p><p>IQOS is a pen-like device that heats tobacco up to 350\u00b0C. Philip Morris claims that because the tobacco is heated and not burnt, the user is exposed to 90 per cent less toxicants than in cigarette smoke.</p><p>Since 2008, the company has invested more than US$4.5 billion into research and development for its \"reduced-risk products\". Sales for such products, including e-cigarettes, contributed 13.8 per cent of its total revenue in 2018. The number of heated tobacco units shipped rose 14.2 per cent to 41.4 billion, and Philip Morris has declared a target of 90 to 100 billion units by 2021.</p><p>In Mr Olczak's words, the company has had to make dramatic moves. \"You know, 15 or 20 years ago, to say that we would develop a safer product was a very visionary statement because we didn't actually know how to address it,\" he claims.</p><p>\"We thought maybe it's the filtration, maybe the quality of the tobacco, maybe the other aspects of the product which would have to change in order to come up with a product that has significantly less toxicants in the smoke. And somewhere along the way, we discovered that the real problem of smoking was coming from combustion.\"</p><p>Smokescreen</p><p>Not that the public has completely bought into Philip Morris' \"smoke-free\" vision declarations. The company's supposed pivot from Big Tobacco to Big Tech has come under strong scrutiny. Non-profit organisation Truth Initiative, for one, has lashed out at Philip Morris, pointing out that it continues to lobby against measures such as higher tobacco taxes and bans on tobacco advertising and sponsorship.</p><p>If Philip Morris is truly committed to a smoke-free future, it should actively support policies to reduce cigarette smoking, and \"set an example for the tobacco industry by stopping all marketing of cigarettes\", the tobacco-free advocacy group said. The company's smoke-free goal - while it continues to aggressively market cigarettes, especially in low- and middle-income countries - has also been described as \"the height of hypocrisy\".</p><p>As for its supposedly \"reduced risk\" products, critics point out that using e-cigarettes, while apparently less toxic, is really no less harmful: In fact, vaping delivers a lot more nicotine (the addictive chemical in tobacco) than smoking and so may lead to even greater nicotine addiction. And the rise of vaping - especially popular with youths in America and Europe - is killing tobacco companies, analysts say. Hence Philip Morris' slick \"smoke-free\" shift, it's been wryly noted.</p><p>The company certainly has its work cut out if it wants to convince the world of its new mission. Back in October, Mr Olczak was in town to attend a meeting of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a global CEO-led organisation.</p><p>As he sits down with BT for this meeting, the exhaustion shows in the lines on his face. Jet lag shook him awake at 3am, he explains.</p><p>Still, when Mr Olczak is told that the photographer will snap shots of him during the interview, he pulls a face of such mock horror the room bursts out in laughter.</p><p>Even after years of globe-trotting for Philip Morris, the senior executive does not take kindly to plane rides. But when you're with Philip Morris, you've just got to accept that flights are part of the job, he tells this writer.</p><p>The native Pole has been in the company for just over 25 years. Before he became COO in January 2018, Mr Olczak was chief financial officer for about five years. Back then, he held a discussion almost every week with investors to assure them that the change in business direction was a strategic one.</p><p>He says matter-of-factly: \"It's a better business because it's difficult to make it a worse business if you are better satisfying your consumers.\"</p><p>Then he takes off like a bullet train: \"You have more than a billion smokers worldwide, and Philip Morris has about 27 per cent of the international market excluding China and the US. Consumers like our brands, and like very much the product and the quality, and the taste that we provide to them in the product.</p><p>\"But nobody was happy with the risk associated with smoking. So if now you can make a product which gives you the same experience, but you know that you're not inhaling 90 per cent of the bad stuff in the smoke, it's difficult for the consumer to be against it.</p><p>\"So you have a product which has the market. You have the advantage of being the first mover. And because you come in with innovation, you're premiumising your portfolio. You know you're a large company and you operate at scale, so if you have the right innovation you can launch it as we did with our product, in 43 markets, with the infrastructure in place, and scale up the innovation. I demonstrated in the past that I am a very skilled manufacturer so I can ride the economies of scale in terms of the product cost pretty fast.</p><p>\"If I add it all together, it shouldn't be a worse business than the past business.\"</p><p>Just last week, Philip Morris beat Wall Street estimates by about 7 per cent to post an earnings per share of US$1.25 for the 2018 fourth quarter, following a year when the company recorded two major dips in its share price.</p><p>Analysts were encouraged by better than expected IQOS market shares outside its key market of Japan, such as in Italy, Germany and Korea. But market share in Japan fell 0.3 percentage points to 15.2 per cent.</p><p>Still, Mr Olczak remains bullish on the prospects in the country. As this interview is taking place in Fairmont Singapore, IQOS 3 is having its global launch in Tokyo, promising to convert even more smokers to the alternative product.</p><p>It is the company's ability to talk to the consumers that makes Japan such an important market for Philip Morris, says Mr Olczak. According to a survey by the company, about 40 per cent of smokers are aware of the heat-not-burn category of tobacco products and the perks of switching from conventional cigarettes.</p><p>Over in the US, Philip Morris is waiting with bated breath as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pores over more than four million pages of the company's scientific evidence. Two applications were filed with the FDA - one, if approved, will allow IQOS to be commercialised in the US and the other, if granted, will let Philip Morris make reduced-risk claims on product packs and marketing materials.</p><p>Then there remains the task of getting more regulators over to their side. Singapore, for one, has banned e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products, as has Hong Kong.</p><p>And the company's loudest critic, the World Health Organisation, remains stony-faced as ever. Even as Philip Morris tries to reinvent itself, taking its story to Davos at the World Economic Forum, where it called for a truce between \"anti-tobacco lobbies\" and the industry, the WHO is not budging.</p><p>Says Mr Olczak : \"As you can imagine, WHO is the biggest opponent of Philip Morris - and I don't think quite rightly so. Because if they were to cool down their emotions, you would realise that actually what we're trying to achieve now is fully aligned with what WHO wants to achieve.\"</p><p>In WHO's view, tobacco companies have misled the public about the risks associated with tobacco use, including promoting alternative products \"while being fully aware that those products were not less harmful to health\".</p><p>Mr Olczak is himself a smoker who has been using IQOS for five years.</p><p>\"When I ask my doctor during my annual health check-up what he sees in my body with regard to my exercise capacity, my lung capacity, my cholesterol, etc, my doctor would think that I had quit smoking, and that I am not using any products!\" he exclaims.</p><p>And Philip Morris' smoke-free goal seems also to have added a spring in many employees' steps, as he tells it.</p><p>\"I actually think the motivation in the company these days is actually presumably higher than when I was starting 25 years ago,\" says Mr Olczak. \"You know, we're running the company in the most exciting times. Not that many companies or industries can disrupt themselves at the core.\"</p><p>As an industry veteran, he sometimes gets asked how to have a \"fast\" career. \"And I say I have no clue. But I can tell you that if you're working in a place that is dynamic and exciting, and you have exciting objectives and strategies, 25 years is like this,\" he says, snapping his fingers.</p><p>In fact, it often feels like he just started at Philip Morris' finance department only a year ago, he says. Asked if he can recall his first day at work, he says without missing a beat: \"Yeah, it was 15th of March, 1993. I remember. Because normally, you never change jobs in the middle of the month, right? You usually start on the first of the month. But for whatever reason, Philip Morris told me to start on the 15th of March, 1993.\"</p><p>Moments after he passed through the office doors, he was asked to go for a briefing on the management performance appraisal system.</p><p>\"And I said, 'Wow, that's very interesting, already on day one they are telling me how they are going to assess my performance. Maybe I joined the wrong company',\" he says with a laugh.</p><p>But it turned out that the organisation wanted to regularly discuss his career aspirations and help him grow. It made a good impression on him. \"Very often you go to the company and they put you behind the desk and say 'Here is a stack of papers; you have to process these papers', and they pay you. That's it. They couldn't care less how you feel.\"</p><p>Another topic that gets Mr Olczak visibly energised is music.</p><p>\"Personally, I don't like being surrounded by people who don't have personal interests. You have to have something,\" he says.</p><p>Mr Olczak has a music studio at home decked out with four guitars, a saxophone, a trumpet, a keyboard, drums, microphones and recording equipment. Business is business, he says, and there are good days and bad days.</p><p>\"When you come back home after a bad day, and you go to the music room for 15 minutes and you take the guitar and play, you relax like there is no tomorrow.\"</p><p>Asked if there is anything about Philip Morris that few know about, Mr Olczak returns to its organisational culture.</p><p>People typically have their guard up the moment they are approached, say by a headhunter, to consider joining Philip Morris, he says. \"A lot of people would tell you initially, 'Philip Morris? No tobacco, I'm not going to tobacco.'</p><p>\"But when they take the leap to have a conversation with the company, and eventually join, they realise it's a completely different world,\" he claims. \"You have a purpose - you want to address the problem of smoking. You have diversity, people can develop, people can grow in the company, and this is not a hierarchical place. It's a great place to work.\"</p><p>Right before the interview ends, he lets on that in fact a few other companies offered him a job back in 1993.</p><p>\"But I've never regretted the day I joined Philip Morris.\"</p><p>JACEK OLCZAK</p><p>Chief Operating Officer<br/>Philip Morris International</p><p>Born January 1965 in Lodz, Poland</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>University of Lodz, Poland: MA in Economics</p><p>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</p><p>1991: Manager, BDO Binder in London and Warsaw</p><p>1993: Manager, Finance and Administration, Philip Morris Polska</p><p>1995: Manager, Internal Controls, Philip Morris International (PMI) in Switzerland</p><p>1996 - 2004: Various positions in finance, sales and operations, Philip Morris Polska</p><p>2004: Managing Director, Poland &amp;

Even the United Nations (UN) agrees that it is more of a right than a luxury. However, in Africa, billions of people are either unreached, have low-quality Internet, or cannot afford it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This can be linked to several systemic issues across the continent, but several stakeholders can agree that a first step would be to deepen Internet infrastructure. Subsea Internet cables from the likes of Seacom, Glo, MTN, MainOne, and a host of others are the major backbone of such a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May 2020, Facebook announced that it was planning to build a 37,000km subsea Internet cable worth $1 billion. While this seems like good news, theres just one small thing; from 2000 to date, at least 19 submarine Internet cables have been connected to Africa.</p><p>What are subsea Internet cables?</p><p>Subsea cables carry telecommunication signals across the continents of the world, connecting countries to international Internet exchanges.</p><p>The subsea cables are like the fibre cables laid on the land except that they have other materials protecting them as they have to stay underwater for life/long time, Simon* a top telecom executive explains.</p><p>Why are subsea Internet cables important?</p><p>Subsea cables help users access the Internet at high speeds. Your service provider connects to one or more of these cables which, in turn, offer you access to the Internet.</p><p>Subsea cables deliver Internet capacity and reliability and underpin the further growth of 4G, 5G, and fixed broadband access for countries, says Ifeanyi Akosionu, Business Director, Technology, Media and Telecoms (TMT) for Verrakki.</p><p>Damage to these cables can cause network disruptions, and you will either have significantly lower connectivity speeds or your network will be offline.</p><p>How does the value get to the user?</p><p>As Simon explains, service providers buy access to these cables at wholesale prices, and in turn, they retail it to end-users. Usually, the subsea cables connected to other continents give you access to their content.</p><p>However, the rise of local Internet exchanges  a physical location where content providers and Internet service providers connect  has made sure your requests for content do not go overseas.</p><p>Will more subsea cables bring faster Internet?</p><p>Having just subsea cables does not translate to faster Internet capacity. Service providers might only have to pay less to connect due to increased competition. Ideally, this should reduce the cost of data for end-users, but this is not always the case.</p><p>According to Akosionu, ample international capacity is good if countries have the required infrastructure to leverage. This will be through networks that take the capacity at the countrys borders to every state and town.</p><p>Akosionus statement points out the gap between Internet cable capacity at Africas borders and its states and towns. On closer inspection, this gap is massive.</p><p>According to data from Many Possibilities, the West and East African coasts each have cables with Internet capacity of at least 100 Tbps. By the end of 2021, the number could double.</p><p>In comparison, according to 2019 data from cable.co.uk, apart from Madagascar, no African country has an average Internet speed of up to 10 Mbps. Madagascar enjoys the benefits of a submarine cable that gives it an average of 22 Mbps, which is why it has a global ranking of 33.</p><p>However, other African countries are not so lucky.

In private the president suggests he's quite pleased.  And on national TV, an entire team, including their owner who has supported the president, take the knee while one player expresses regret for standing during the anthem.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR:  A third senator comes out against the Republicans' latest repeal and replace effort.  So with the bill all but dead how can Republicans follow through with their biggest campaign promise?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BRIGGS:  And growing desperation in Puerto Rico.  Nearly the entire island remains without power and the president finally weighs in on the devastation.  But not without taking a few shots at Puerto Rico.  </p><p> Welcome back to EARLY START.  I'm Dave Briggs.  </p><p> ROMANS:  And I'm Christine Romans.  It is -- it's 31 minutes past the hour.  4:00 a.m. here in the East -- 4:30 a.m. in the East.  </p><p> Trump versus the NFL.  Neither the president nor the players backing down from this controversy ignited by the president's strong criticisms of players kneeling during the national anthem.  Mr. Trump appearing quite satisfied with reaction to his comments telling conservative leaders at a White House dinner that it's really caught on, adding he said what millions of Americans were thinking.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  It comes as the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals staged the latest protest during Monday Night Football.  Cowboys' players along with owner and Trump supporter Jerry Jones taking a knee before the national anthem.  During the anthem both teams stood linking arms or holding hands.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The culture war that has erupted since President Trump called players who kneel during the anthem sons of B's, SOBs, who should be fired.  Not sitting well with White House chief of staff John Kelly. We're told Kelly, a four-star general, was not pleased by the fight that Trump started with his remarks.  </p><p> The controversy created Friday night when the president made those comments but Kelly also tells CNN he's appalled by the lack of respect for the flag and the national anthem.  This is what he say, quote, \"I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed.  Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes.\"  </p><p> BRIGGS:  White House officials say they believe this will blow over but don't know how long the president will keep the controversy alive. Sarah Sanders telling the press corps it is hypocritical of players protesting police brutality to protest the American flag.  And she adds this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, we certainly respect the rights that people have, but I think we also need to focus.  Again, this isn't about the president being against something, which is what everybody wants to draw.  </p><p> This is about the president being for something.  This is about the president being for respecting our country through symbols like the American flag, like the national anthem, and the hundreds of thousands of people that actually stand versus the few hundred that may have knelt.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  Meantime, Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva is apologizing to his teammates.  You might recall -- there he is -- he stood alone during the anthem while the rest of the squad remained in the locker room Sunday.  </p><p> Villanueva is a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan, earning a Bronze Star with Valor.  He says he is not offended by people kneeling.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALEJANDRO VILLANUEVA, PITTSBURGH STEELERS:  Every single time, you know, I see that picture of me standing by myself, I feel embarrassed to a degree because, again, like I said, unintentionally I left my teammates behind.  </p><p> It wasn't me stepping forward.  I never planned to boycott the plan that the Steelers came up with.  I just thought that there should be some middle ground where I could stay in the tunnel, nobody would see me, and then afterwards I just wouldn't talk to the media, like I do all the time.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  The plan was for the team to stay in the locker room but Villanueva said he asked Steelers captain and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger if there was a way to watch the national anthem from the tunnel.  Roethlisberger agreed.  </p><p> There's also new reaction overnight from the widow of Pat Tillman, the former NFL player who was killed in a friendly fire incident in 2004 in Afghanistan.  The president has re-tweeted images of Tillman in the last few days.  </p><p> ROMANS:  But in a statement to CNN's Brian Stelter, Marie Tillman says, quote, \"As a football player and soldier Pat inspired countless Americans to unify.  Pat's service along with that of every man and woman in service should never be politicized in a way that divides us. We are too great of a country for that.\"  </p><p> Strong reaction also coming from the NBA with top players and coaches weighing in.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LEBRON JAMES, CLEVELAND CAVALIERS:  We have to figure out a way how we come together and be as great as we can, be as a people, because the people run this country, not one individual.  And damn sure not him.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [04:35:11] ROMANS:  Some athletes say they're not --  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GREGG POPOVICH, HEAD COACH, SAN ANTONIO SPURS:  This is an individual who actually thought that when people held arms during the game that they were doing it to honor the flag.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  So many of these folks say that they're not protesting the military.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  No.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The military has nothing to do with it.  They're not protesting the losses on the battle field.  They're simply saying -- and these players have different reasons, many of them, but they're simply saying that life is not equal under that flag and under that anthem, and they just are recognizing it quietly.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  But you make an important point.  None of these players are anti-military.  Colin Kaepernick may not have been the best messenger to start this but now the president has given them new meaning and given this movement really allowed it to coalesce.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Right.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Around him.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board not pleased with politics seeping into sports, pointing fingers at everybody basically, saying, quote, \"American democracy was healthier when politics at the ballpark was limited to fans booing politicians who threw out the first ball.  But now the players want to be politicians and use their fame to lecture other Americans.  The losers are the millions of Americans who would rather cheer for their teams on Sunday as a respite from work and the other divisions of American life.\"   BRIGGS:  And they added that's the kind of rant from the president you'd hear in a lousy sports bar and they called it ignorant.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Certainly has resonated, though, hasn't it?  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.  </p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy vowing to fight on even though their plan to overhaul Obamacare appears to be dead in the water.  During a live town hall debate on CNN last night the senators offered no new initiatives to win support for their measure, simply making the argument that Obamacare is failing, change is needed.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Well, it's not working and it's never going to work.  And I'm not going to spend more money, good after bad, fixing the system that can't be saved.  We need to find a better way.  So we're going to press on and it's OK to vote.  It's OK to fall short, if you do, for an idea you believe in.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  Last night's debate coming just hours after the Congressional Budget Office released a partial score for the GOP plan saying it would cut the budget deficit by at least $133 billion but of course millions of Americans would lose comprehensive health insurance.  That was the final straw for Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins.  </p><p> ROMANS:  She is now officially a no vote, potentially killing this bill because it doesn't do enough to protect people with preexisting conditions.  It cuts Medicaid too deeply.  The state of Graham-Cassidy could be decided when Republicans meet in the Senate today.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  President Trump expected to get a briefing today on the apocalyptic hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico.  White House officials say he'll meet with Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert who just returned from the island along with FEMA chief Brock Long.  </p><p> The president tweeting about Puerto Rico late Monday finally, his first direct comment on the dire situation there, saying the saying the island is in deep trouble following Hurricane Maria but choosing to focus on Puerto Rico's financial troubles and infrastructure issues while millions are essentially cut off from the world.  </p><p> ROMANS:  It comes as the administration faces growing criticism for appearing to ignore Maria's aftermath in Puerto Rico.  Singer Mark Anthony's tweet reflecting that anger.  He says, quote, \"Mr. President, shut the blank up about the NFL.  Do something about our people in need in Puerto Rico.  We are American citizens, too.\"  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defending the federal response to Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico, calling it anything but slow. Either way without power and communication the situation in this U.S. territory is dire.   CNN's Bill Weir has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I'd like to show you around what is left of what once was one of the most scenic neighborhoods in Aguas Buenas , the Good Waters, a town of about 28,000 south of San Juan.  </p><p> First of all, the first thing you see as you drive up in the highlands it looks like a bomb went off.  This is lush tropical greenery. Imagine the flowers and the foliage.  It's like a lawnmower in the sky came down.  And it's like that across the island.  But this house is in a neighborhood put right on a ridge.  It's so beautiful up here. And this is Diana and her husband, Miguel.  </p><p> Say hi.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hello.  </p><p> WEIR:  She's OK.  She's OK.  Her son, Miguel, and the little dog, hello, hello, he's doing OK.  So they survived, thankfully, but they're very worried because her husband, Miguel, who is a Vietnam war veteran, is bedridden inside.  And he needs insulin and so refrigeration is a matter of life or death.  And the power is out for most of Puerto Rico.  </p><p> And here's why. Look at this.  One of the main transmission towers that goes to San Juan crushed this home.  Thankfully the man who lives here evacuated before the storm.  He's in a shelter.  But only about 50 people in this town of 28,000 evacuated.  </p><p> [04:40:02] Most rode it out.  And so search and rescue teams aren't available to check on everyone because the roads are impassible, as you see right now.  This is not something you fix with a bucket truck. This will take helicopters.  This will take months.  But as we follow the line across, imagine this scene is being replayed across Puerto Rico.  And the need is so desperate.  If this is any indication, Puerto Rico may rise again but they are going to need a ton of help and a lot of time.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Bill Weir, thank you for that.  </p><p> Maria now posing a threat along the North Carolina coast line.  Let's get to meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.  </p><p> PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, Dave and Christine. </p><p> (WEATHER REPORT)</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Thanks, Pedram.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  OK.  North Korea starting to boost defenses along its east coast after warning it has the right to shoot down American planes. We're live in Seoul next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [04:46:02] ROMANS:  All right.  The SEC chairman says his agency didn't do enough to prevent a 2016 cyber attack.  SEC chairman Jay Clayton testifies on Capitol Hill today.  The topic, a 2016 hack at America's top markets regulator.  </p><p> According to prepared testimony seen by CNN, Clayton is expected to tell lawmakers the agency is fully investigating the attack and will promise to shore up cyber security, writing, \"We must remain on top of evolving threats when it comes to securing our own networks and systems against intrusion.\"  </p><p> The SEC revealed last week a breach of its Edgar System, that's a huge database of company earnings, sales, corporate activity, just the bible for information about public companies.  It's still unclear what information was stolen but the SEC says that information may have been used for insider trading.  </p><p> This hack was announced right after another big financial cyber attack at Equifax.  That breach exposed the data of millions of Americas and the accounting firm says Deloitte said yesterday its e-mail system has been hit.  Deloitte told CNN it only affected very few clients.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Voters in Alabama heading to the polls in just a few hours to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now the race pits President Trump's pick, Alabama Senator Luther Strange, against Judge Roy Moore, the choice of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.  </p><p> Bannon says Moore would help save the president from himself.  A Moore victory, which is looking likely, according to the polls, could give momentum to other anti-establishment candidates looking to unseat Senate Republicans.  </p><p> Also Anthony Weiner's political and personal fall from grace reaching a new low.  The former New York congressman will report to federal prison on November 6th after being sentenced to 21 months for sexting with a teenager.  Weiner also sentenced to three years of supervised release.  The judge saying Weiner committed a serious crime that deserves serious punishment.  And that sentence carried more importance because of his notoriety.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Weiner cried when the sentence came down.  His attorneys had pushed for probation.  The 53-year-old pleaded guilty back in May to transferring obscene material to a minor.  The charges stemming from communications, social media communications Weiner had with a 15-year- old girl on social media sites.  Weiner will now have to register as a sex offender.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  A massive wildfire forcing more than 1,000 evacuations in southern California.  Fire officials say winds are fuelling the fire which has already burned more than 2,000 acres in the Santa Anna mountains near Anaheim.  Crews are dropping water on the tall flames from the air and using bulldozers to assembly containment lines on the ground.  No reported injuries.  An area high school has been set up as a shelter.  No word on what sparked the fire which so far only 5 percent contained.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Look at those whipping that fire around.  </p><p> All right.  First daughter Ivanka Trump is spearheading a multi- million dollar campaign.  The topic STEM.  Details on the CNN Money Stream next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [04:53:33] SANDERS:  We've not declared war on North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  The White House rejecting claims by North Korea that President Trump's weekend tweet amounts to a declaration of war.  The president tweeting North Korea's leadership, quote, \"won't be around much longer.\"  Pyongyang's Foreign minister says that gives North Korea the right to retaliate by shooting down U.S. fighter jets.  </p><p> Let's go live to CNN's Paula Hancocks live in Seoul, South Korea with the latest.  </p><p> Good morning, Paula.  </p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Dave.  Well, we've had an intelligence briefing from the NIS.  They have briefed lawmakers who have briefed us.  And what they have said is that they have noticed over the weekend a build-up of North Korean airplanes and other military assets on the east coast of the country.  They believe, according to the intelligence agency, that this was following the flyover from U.S. B1B bombers.  They carried out that show of force over the weekend in international waters off the east coast of North Korea.  And the Pentagon said it was the farthest north of the DMZ this century that they have flown.  </p><p> So we understand from the NIS also that North Korean soldiers along the DMZ, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, have been ordered to report an incident first and then take measures second.  Now this is crucial because this shows that they do fear there could be an accidental clash and they appear, according to intelligence agencies here at least, to be taking measure to try and prevent that.  </p><p> Now of course the war of words has been heating up between the U.S. president, Donald Trump, and also Ri Yong-ho, the Foreign minister, as we heard there.  </p><p> [04:55:10] We have also heard from the South Korean Foreign minister. She is trying to de-escalate the situation.  Speaking in Washington she said it is inevitable that there will be another provocation from North Korea that said it's very important for the U.S. and South Korea to work together, to try and de-escalate the situation -- Dave.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  That aforementioned Trump tweet forcing Twitter to clarify its threat policy.  Extraordinary times.  </p><p> Paula Hancocks, live for us in Seoul, thanks.  </p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  We have breaking news from the Middle East this morning.  Israeli police say three people were killed in a shooting attack at a crossing this morning between Israel and the West Bank. Authorities say a Palestinian gunman opened fire at the Har Adar Israeli settlement, claiming the lives of two security guards and a border policeman.  One other person was injured.  Police say the attacker and two others traveling with him were killed.  Security is being increased in nearby Jerusalem today in the wake of that attack.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Iran's claim that it tested a new ballistic missile last weekend appears to be false.  U.S. intelligence's radar systems and sensors picked up no indication of a launch.  And if there had been a missile launch it would have been detected by a number of U.S. assets in the region according to a White House official.  </p><p> President Trump tweeted about the suspected launch right after the Iranians released footage on Saturday.  It's not known if the president receives an intelligence briefing about the launch before tweeting, one would hope.  A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment to CNN.  </p><p> Dozens of conservative Catholic scholars and clergy charging Pope Francis for spreading hearsay.  It's a bold and likely feudal attack on the Pope's agenda of reform.  In a letter with 40 signatures delivered to the Pope last month and 22 more scholars and clergy have signed on since them.  The conservative members say they speak for a large number of Catholics who lack freedom of speech.  They accuse Pope Francis of supporting heretical positions on marriage, the moral life and more.  Francis has not responded and the Vatican is not commenting.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Interesting.  </p><p> All right.  57 minutes past the hour, let's get a check on CNN Money Stream this morning.  Global stocks lower today following a drop on Wall Street.  Two reasons.  Big sell-off in tech and North Korea. North Korea's Foreign minister called a tweet by President Trump a, quote, \"declaration of war.\"  Tension between the two countries has been one of the few geopolitical events to shake markets this year.  </p><p> Big tech stocks also fell Monday.  Facebook, Microsoft, Apple.  Look at this.  Apple is down 10 percent over the past two weeks.  That's nearing correction territory.  Blame mediocre demand for its newest iPhone -- excuse me.  There are reports of short lines and low sales for the iPhone 8.  </p><p> Target is giving its workers a raise.  The retailer plans to raise its minimum wage to $11 next month eventually offering 15 bucks an hour by the year 2020.  Higher wages is one way to fill jobs in a tight labor market, especially during the busy holiday season.  Retailers add tens of thousands of workers.  Target plans to offer its new wage to its 100,000 seasonal hires this year.  That's important when a big retailer raises that minimum wage like that.  </p><p> Ivanka Trump spearheading a multi-million dollar campaign to promote STEM.  President Trump signing a memorandum yesterday allocating $200 million to expand STEM education in schools.  Ivanka Trump has worked on this initiative since the transition, along with the Education Department, the Labor Department, business leaders and others.  The first daughter will travel to Detroit today to announce additional money from the private sector.  The program is designed with gender and racial diversity in mind.  </p><p> In 2016 President Obama proposed $4 billion for computer science education in American public schools.  Congress didn't give it to him. </p><p> BRIGGS:  We've waited for the long awaited impact of Ivanka.  Is this it?  </p><p> ROMANS:  This is one of them.  I think -- look, she's been behind the scenes working on a lot of kid and family issues.  I think this is just one of those in her suite.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  A lot has been behind the scenes indeed.  </p><p> All right.  EARLY START continues right now with the latest on this Trump versus the NFL controversy.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Heightened emotions over the national anthem controversy.  In private the president suggests he is quite pleased and on national television an entire team takes a knee while one player from a different team expresses regret for standing during the anthem.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  And a third senator comes out against the Republicans' latest repeal and replace effort.  So with the bill all but dead how can Republicans follow through with the central campaign promise for seven years.  </p><p> ROMANS:  And growing desperation in Puerto Rico.  The entire island remains without power.  Nearly the entire island as the president now finally weighs in on the devastation there.  3.2 million American citizens on that island.  </p><p> Good morning and welcome to EARLY START.  I'm Christine Romans.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  I'm Dave Briggs.  It's Tuesday September 26th.  It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.  </p><p> Just a few Puerto Rico tweets but 20 about sports over the weekend for President Trump.  And that's where we start.  With Trump versus the NFL --  </p><p> [Byline: Christine Romans, Dave Briggs, Bill Weir, Paula Hancocks] [High: Huge devastation in Puerto Rico affecting millions of American citizens mainly without power, while president tweeting more about NFL.

Nearly the entire island remains without power and the president finally weighs in on the devastation. But not without taking a few shots at Puerto Rico.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It is -- it's 31 minutes past the hour. 4:00 a.m. here in the East -- 4:30 a.m. in the East.</p><p>Trump versus the NFL. Neither the president nor the players backing down from this controversy ignited by the president's strong criticisms of players kneeling during the national anthem. Mr. Trump appearing quite satisfied with reaction to his comments telling conservative leaders at a White House dinner that it's really caught on, adding he said what millions of Americans were thinking.</p><p>BRIGGS: It comes as the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals staged the latest protest during Monday Night Football. Cowboys' players along with owner and Trump supporter <person><nameText>Jerry Jones </nameText></person>taking a knee before the national anthem. During the anthem both teams stood linking arms or holding hands.</p><p>ROMANS: The culture war that has erupted since <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>called players who kneel during the anthem sons of B's, SOBs, who should be fired. Not sitting well with White House chief of staff <person><nameText>John Kelly. </nameText></person>We're told Kelly, a four-star general, was not pleased by the fight that Trump started with his remarks.</p><p>The controversy created Friday night when the president made those comments but Kelly also tells CNN he's appalled by the lack of respect for the flag and the national anthem. This is what he say, quote, \"I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed. Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: White House officials say they believe this will blow over but don't know how long the president will keep the controversy alive. Sarah Sanders telling the press corps it is hypocritical of players protesting police brutality to protest the American flag. And she adds this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, we certainly respect the rights that people have, but I think we also need to focus. Again, this isn't about the president being against something, which is what everybody wants to draw.</p><p>This is about the president being for something. This is about the president being for respecting our country through symbols like the American flag, like the national anthem, and the hundreds of thousands of people that actually stand versus the few hundred that may have knelt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Meantime, Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva is apologizing to his teammates. You might recall -- there he is -- he stood alone during the anthem while the rest of the squad remained in the locker room Sunday.</p><p>Villanueva is a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan, earning a Bronze Star with Valor. He says he is not offended by people kneeling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEJANDRO VILLANUEVA, PITTSBURGH STEELERS: Every single time, you know, I see that picture of me standing by myself, I feel embarrassed to a degree because, again, like I said, unintentionally I left my teammates behind.</p><p>It wasn't me stepping forward. I never planned to boycott the plan that the Steelers came up with. I just thought that there should be some middle ground where I could stay in the tunnel, nobody would see me, and then afterwards I just wouldn't talk to the media, like I do all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The plan was for the team to stay in the locker room but Villanueva said he asked Steelers captain and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger if there was a way to watch the national anthem from the tunnel. Roethlisberger agreed.</p><p>There's also new reaction overnight from the widow of Pat Tillman, the former NFL player who was killed in a friendly fire incident in 2004 in Afghanistan. The president has re-tweeted images of Tillman in the last few days.</p><p>ROMANS: But in a statement to CNN's Brian Stelter, Marie Tillman says, quote, \"As a football player and soldier Pat inspired countless Americans to unify. Pat's service along with that of every man and woman in service should never be politicized in a way that divides us. We are too great of a country for that.\"</p><p>Strong reaction also coming from the NBA with top players and coaches weighing in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEBRON JAMES, CLEVELAND CAVALIERS: We have to figure out a way how we come together and be as great as we can, be as a people, because the people run this country, not one individual. And damn sure not him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:35:11] ROMANS: Some athletes say they're not --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREGG POPOVICH, HEAD COACH, SAN ANTONIO SPURS: This is an individual who actually thought that when people held arms during the game that they were doing it to honor the flag.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So many of these folks say that they're not protesting the military.</p><p>BRIGGS: No.</p><p>ROMANS: The military has nothing to do with it. They're not protesting the losses on the battle field. They're simply saying -- and these players have different reasons, many of them, but they're simply saying that life is not equal under that flag and under that anthem, and they just are recognizing it quietly.</p><p>BRIGGS: But you make an important point. None of these players are anti-military. Colin Kaepernick may not have been the best messenger to start this but now the president has given them new meaning and given this movement really allowed it to coalesce.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: Around him.</p><p>ROMANS: The \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board not pleased with politics seeping into sports, pointing fingers at everybody basically, saying, quote, \"American democracy was healthier when politics at the ballpark was limited to fans booing politicians who threw out the first ball. But now the players want to be politicians and use their fame to lecture other Americans. The losers are the millions of Americans who would rather cheer for their teams on Sunday as a respite from work and the other divisions of American life.\" BRIGGS: And they added that's the kind of rant from the president you'd hear in a lousy sports bar and they called it ignorant.</p><p>ROMANS: Certainly has resonated, though, hasn't it?</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy vowing to fight on even though their plan to overhaul Obamacare appears to be dead in the water. During a live town hall debate on CNN last night the senators offered no new initiatives to win support for their measure, simply making the argument that Obamacare is failing, change is needed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, it's not working and it's never going to work. And I'm not going to spend more money, good after bad, fixing the system that can't be saved. We need to find a better way. So we're going to press on and it's OK to vote. It's OK to fall short, if you do, for an idea you believe in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Last night's debate coming just hours after the Congressional Budget Office released a partial score for the GOP plan saying it would cut the budget deficit by at least $133 billion but of course millions of Americans would lose comprehensive health insurance. That was the final straw for Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins.</p><p>ROMANS: She is now officially a no vote, potentially killing this bill because it doesn't do enough to protect people with preexisting conditions. It cuts Medicaid too deeply. The state of Graham-Cassidy could be decided when Republicans meet in the Senate today.</p><p>BRIGGS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>expected to get a briefing today on the apocalyptic hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico. White House officials say he'll meet with Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert who just returned from the island along with FEMA chief Brock Long.</p><p>The president tweeting about Puerto Rico late Monday finally, his first direct comment on the dire situation there, saying the saying the island is in deep trouble following Hurricane Maria but choosing to focus on Puerto Rico's financial troubles and infrastructure issues while millions are essentially cut off from the world.</p><p>ROMANS: It comes as the administration faces growing criticism for appearing to ignore Maria's aftermath in Puerto Rico. Singer Mark Anthony's tweet reflecting that anger. He says, quote, \"Mr. President, shut the blank up about the NFL. Do something about our people in need in Puerto Rico. We are American citizens, too.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defending the federal response to Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico, calling it anything but slow. Either way without power and communication the situation in this U.S. territory is dire. CNN's Bill Weir has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'd like to show you around what is left of what once was one of the most scenic neighborhoods in Aguas Buenas , the Good Waters, a town of about 28,000 south of San Juan.</p><p>First of all, the first thing you see as you drive up in the highlands it looks like a bomb went off. This is lush tropical greenery. Imagine the flowers and the foliage. It's like a lawnmower in the sky came down. And it's like that across the island. But this house is in a neighborhood put right on a ridge. It's so beautiful up here. And this is Diana and her husband, Miguel.</p><p>Say hi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.</p><p>WEIR: She's OK. She's OK. Her son, Miguel, and the little dog, hello, hello, he's doing OK. So they survived, thankfully, but they're very worried because her husband, Miguel, who is a Vietnam war veteran, is bedridden inside. And he needs insulin and so refrigeration is a matter of life or death. And the power is out for most of Puerto Rico.</p><p>And here's why. Look at this. One of the main transmission towers that goes to San Juan crushed this home. Thankfully the man who lives here evacuated before the storm. He's in a shelter. But only about 50 people in this town of 28,000 evacuated.</p><p>[04:40:02] Most rode it out. And so search and rescue teams aren't available to check on everyone because the roads are impassible, as you see right now. This is not something you fix with a bucket truck. This will take helicopters. This will take months. But as we follow the line across, imagine this scene is being replayed across Puerto Rico. And the need is so desperate. If this is any indication, Puerto Rico may rise again but they are going to need a ton of help and a lot of time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Bill Weir, thank you for that.</p><p>Maria now posing a threat along the North Carolina coast line. Let's get to meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, Dave and Christine.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thanks, Pedram.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. North Korea starting to boost defenses along its east coast after warning it has the right to shoot down American planes. We're live in Seoul next.</p><p>[04:46:02] ROMANS: All right. The SEC chairman says his agency didn't do enough to prevent a 2016 cyber attack. SEC chairman Jay Clayton testifies on Capitol Hill today. The topic, a 2016 hack at America's top markets regulator.</p><p>According to prepared testimony seen by CNN, Clayton is expected to tell lawmakers the agency is fully investigating the attack and will promise to shore up cyber security, writing, \"We must remain on top of evolving threats when it comes to securing our own networks and systems against intrusion.\"</p><p>The SEC revealed last week a breach of its Edgar System, that's a huge database of company earnings, sales, corporate activity, just the bible for information about public companies. It's still unclear what information was stolen but the SEC says that information may have been used for insider trading.</p><p>This hack was announced right after another big financial cyber attack at Equifax. That breach exposed the data of millions of Americas and the accounting firm says Deloitte said yesterday its e-mail system has been hit. Deloitte told CNN it only affected very few clients.</p><p>BRIGGS: Voters in Alabama heading to the polls in just a few hours to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Now the race pits <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>pick, Alabama Senator Luther Strange, against Judge Roy Moore, the choice of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.</p><p>Bannon says Moore would help save the president from himself. A Moore victory, which is looking likely, according to the polls, could give momentum to other anti-establishment candidates looking to unseat Senate Republicans.</p><p>Also Anthony Weiner's political and personal fall from grace reaching a new low. The former New York congressman will report to federal prison on November 6th after being sentenced to 21 months for sexting with a teenager. Weiner also sentenced to three years of supervised release. The judge saying Weiner committed a serious crime that deserves serious punishment. And that sentence carried more importance because of his notoriety.</p><p>ROMANS: Weiner cried when the sentence came down. His attorneys had pushed for probation. The 53-year-old pleaded guilty back in May to transferring obscene material to a minor. The charges stemming from communications, social media communications Weiner had with a 15-year- old girl on social media sites. Weiner will now have to register as a sex offender.</p><p>BRIGGS: A massive wildfire forcing more than 1,000 evacuations in southern California. Fire officials say winds are fuelling the fire which has already burned more than 2,000 acres in the Santa Anna mountains near Anaheim. Crews are dropping water on the tall flames from the air and using bulldozers to assembly containment lines on the ground. No reported injuries. An area high school has been set up as a shelter. No word on what sparked the fire which so far only 5 percent contained.</p><p>ROMANS: Look at those whipping that fire around.</p><p>All right. First daughter <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>is spearheading a multi- million dollar campaign. The topic STEM. Details on the CNN Money Stream next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:53:33] SANDERS: We've not declared war on North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The White House rejecting claims by North Korea that <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>weekend tweet amounts to a declaration of war. The president tweeting North Korea's leadership, quote, \"won't be around much longer.\" Pyongyang's Foreign minister says that gives North Korea the right to retaliate by shooting down U.S. fighter jets.</p><p>Let's go live to CNN's Paula Hancocks live in Seoul, South Korea with the latest.</p><p>Good morning, Paula.</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Dave. Well, we've had an intelligence briefing from the NIS. They have briefed lawmakers who have briefed us. And what they have said is that they have noticed over the weekend a build-up of North Korean airplanes and other military assets on the east coast of the country. They believe, according to the intelligence agency, that this was following the flyover from U.S. B1B bombers. They carried out that show of force over the weekend in international waters off the east coast of North Korea. And the Pentagon said it was the farthest north of the DMZ this century that they have flown.</p><p>So we understand from the NIS also that North Korean soldiers along the DMZ, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, have been ordered to report an incident first and then take measures second. Now this is crucial because this shows that they do fear there could be an accidental clash and they appear, according to intelligence agencies here at least, to be taking measure to try and prevent that.</p><p>Now of course the war of words has been heating up between the U.S. president, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>and also Ri Yong-ho, the Foreign minister, as we heard there.</p><p>[04:55:10] We have also heard from the South Korean Foreign minister. She is trying to de-escalate the situation. Speaking in Washington she said it is inevitable that there will be another provocation from North Korea that said it's very important for the U.S. and South Korea to work together, to try and de-escalate the situation -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: That aforementioned Trump tweet forcing Twitter to clarify its threat policy. Extraordinary times.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, live for us in Seoul, thanks.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. We have breaking news from the Middle East this morning. Israeli police say three people were killed in a shooting attack at a crossing this morning between Israel and the West Bank. Authorities say a Palestinian gunman opened fire at the Har Adar Israeli settlement, claiming the lives of two security guards and a border policeman. One other person was injured. Police say the attacker and two others traveling with him were killed. Security is being increased in nearby Jerusalem today in the wake of that attack.</p><p>BRIGGS: Iran's claim that it tested a new ballistic missile last weekend appears to be false. U.S. intelligence's radar systems and sensors picked up no indication of a launch. And if there had been a missile launch it would have been detected by a number of U.S. assets in the region according to a White House official.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeted about the suspected launch right after the Iranians released footage on Saturday. It's not known if the president receives an intelligence briefing about the launch before tweeting, one would hope. A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment to CNN.</p><p>Dozens of conservative Catholic scholars and clergy charging Pope Francis for spreading hearsay. It's a bold and likely feudal attack on the Pope's agenda of reform. In a letter with 40 signatures delivered to the Pope last month and 22 more scholars and clergy have signed on since them. The conservative members say they speak for a large number of Catholics who lack freedom of speech. They accuse Pope Francis of supporting heretical positions on marriage, the moral life and more. Francis has not responded and the Vatican is not commenting.</p><p>ROMANS: Interesting.</p><p>All right. 57 minutes past the hour, let's get a check on CNN Money Stream this morning. Global stocks lower today following a drop on Wall Street. Two reasons. Big sell-off in tech and North Korea. North Korea's Foreign minister called a tweet by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>a, quote, \"declaration of war.\" Tension between the two countries has been one of the few geopolitical events to shake markets this year.</p><p>Big tech stocks also fell Monday. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple. Look at this. Apple is down 10 percent over the past two weeks. That's nearing correction territory. Blame mediocre demand for its newest iPhone -- excuse me. There are reports of short lines and low sales for the iPhone 8.</p><p>Target is giving its workers a raise. The retailer plans to raise its minimum wage to $11 next month eventually offering 15 bucks an hour by the year 2020. Higher wages is one way to fill jobs in a tight labor market, especially during the busy holiday season. Retailers add tens of thousands of workers. Target plans to offer its new wage to its 100,000 seasonal hires this year. That's important when a big retailer raises that minimum wage like that.</p><p><person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>spearheading a multi-million dollar campaign to promote STEM. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signing a memorandum yesterday allocating $200 million to expand STEM education in schools. <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>has worked on this initiative since the transition, along with the Education Department, the Labor Department, business leaders and others. The first daughter will travel to Detroit today to announce additional money from the private sector. The program is designed with gender and racial diversity in mind.</p><p>In 2016 President Obama proposed $4 billion for computer science education in American public schools. Congress didn't give it to him.</p><p>BRIGGS: We've waited for the long awaited impact of Ivanka. Is this it?</p><p>ROMANS: This is one of them. I think -- look, she's been behind the scenes working on a lot of kid and family issues. I think this is just one of those in her suite.</p><p>BRIGGS: A lot has been behind the scenes indeed.</p><p>All right. EARLY START continues right now with the latest on this Trump versus the NFL controversy.</p><p>ROMANS: Heightened emotions over the national anthem controversy. In private the president suggests he is quite pleased and on national television an entire team takes a knee while one player from a different team expresses regret for standing during the anthem.</p><p>BRIGGS: And a third senator comes out against the Republicans' latest repeal and replace effort. So with the bill all but dead how can Republicans follow through with the central campaign promise for seven years.</p><p>ROMANS: And growing desperation in Puerto Rico. The entire island remains without power. Nearly the entire island as the president now finally weighs in on the devastation there. 3.2 million American citizens on that island.</p><p>Good morning and welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. It's Tuesday September 26th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>Just a few Puerto Rico tweets but 20 about sports over the weekend for <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And that's where we start.

Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung.</p><p>The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment -- although US President Donald Trump's war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card.</p><p>As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services.</p><p>\"You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,\" Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP.</p><p>Highlighting Apple's success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the \"internet of things\", would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020.</p><p>Digital assistants such as Alexa and Siri may start talking to each other, after Amazon, Apple and Google this month formed an alliance with other industry players to develop a common standard for smart home devices.</p><p>Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market.</p><p>- Leap into the quantum dark -</p><p>For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing.</p><p>Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank. </p><p>Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its \"Libra\" project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out.</p><p>Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year.</p><p>However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech's contribution to climate change.</p><p>- The price of privacy -</p><p>Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop.</p><p>That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook first laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties.</p><p>\"People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,\" said Bindels.</p><p>\"There's a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It's just another currency.\"</p><p>Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, said that tradeoff amounts to a \"Faustian bargain\" which imperils our human rights.</p><p>- Tech wars -</p><p>To Beijing's anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs.</p><p>Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US sanctions depriving those firms of access to US components would only encourage China to stand on its own feet.</p><p>\"In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,\" he said.</p><p>Samm Sacks, an expert on China's digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses.</p><p>The two countries have cooperated in research, \"and severing that could have global consequences\", she warned.</p><p>- Taxing times -</p><p>The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media. </p><p>Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a \"unified approach\" for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants.</p><p>Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another front in Trump's multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods.</p><p>jit-burs/rl/txw</p><p>ACCENTURE</p><p>FACEBOOK</p><p>NETFLIX</p><p>THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY</p><p>SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS</p><p>AMAZON.COM</p><p>ZTE</p><p>APPLE INC.</p><p>GOOGLE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-SMAC in the DARQ five trends shaping tech in 2020 </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV5-BWT1-JBV1-X1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><timeReceived>5:25 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And it may even be ready in 2020 Photo: AFP / LLUIS GENE Super-fast fifth-generation network speeds are meant to revolutionise communications along with areas like urban transport. But so far, 5G has failed to meet expectations due to the lagging build of infrastructure in many places. Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung.The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment -- although US President Donald Trump's war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card.As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services. \"You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,\" Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP. Privacy is 'just another currency' Photo: AFP / Pau Barrena Highlighting Apple's success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the \"internet of things\", would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020.Digital assistants such as Alexa and Siri may start talking to each other, after Amazon, Apple and Google this month formed an alliance with other industry players to develop a common standard for smart home devices.Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market. Tax 'em more? Break 'em up? The debate won't end in 2020 Photo: AFP / Lionel BONAVENTURE For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing.Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank.Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its \"Libra\" project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out.Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year.However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech's contribution to climate change. Will we fall in love again with tech in 2020? Photo: AFP / JOSEP LAGO Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop.That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook first laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties.\"People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,\" said Bindels.\"There's a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It's just another currency.\"Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, said that tradeoff amounts to a \"Faustian bargain\" which imperils our human rights.To Beijing's anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs.Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US sanctions depriving those firms of access to US components would only encourage China to stand on its own feet.\"In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,\" he said.Samm Sacks, an expert on China's digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses.The two countries have cooperated in research, \"and severing that could have global consequences\", she warned.The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media.Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a \"unified approach\" for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants.Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another front in Trump's multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767157734303774775776100144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV1-8VP1-F03R-N218-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>6:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung.</p><p>The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment -- although US President Donald Trump's war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card.</p><p>As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services.</p><p>\"You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,\" Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP.</p><p>Highlighting Apple's success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the \"internet of things\", would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020.</p><p>Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market.</p><p>- Leap into the quantum dark -</p><p>For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing.</p><p>Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank.</p><p>Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its \"Libra\" project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out.</p><p>Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year.</p><p>However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech's contribution to climate change.</p><p>- The price of privacy -</p><p>Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop.</p><p>That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties.</p><p>One recent revelation showed that Google is mining the medical data of millions of people, in a bid to access what observers think will be the next frontier of growth in tech -- healthcare.</p><p>\"People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,\" said Bindels.</p><p>\"There's a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It's just another currency.\"</p><p>For Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, that tradeoff amounts to a \"Faustian bargain\" which imperils our human rights.</p><p>- Tech wars -</p><p>To Beijing's anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs.</p><p>Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US tech sanctions would only encourage China to stand on its own feet.</p><p>\"In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,\" he said.</p><p>Samm Sacks, an expert on China's digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses.</p><p>The two countries have cooperated in research, \"and severing that could have global consequences\", she warned.</p><p>- Taxing times -</p><p>The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media.</p><p>Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a \"unified approach\" for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants.</p><p>Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another potential front in Trump's multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNY-DS71-JDVB-60DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Relaxnews All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>AFP - RELAXNEWS (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung.</p><p>The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment - although US President Donald Trump's war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card.</p><p>As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services.</p><p>\"You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,\" Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP.</p><p>Highlighting Apple's success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the \"internet of things\", would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020.</p><p>Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market.</p><p>- Leap into the quantum dark -</p><p>For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing.</p><p>Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank.</p><p>Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its \"Libra\" project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out.</p><p>Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year.</p><p>However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech's contribution to climate change.</p><p>- The price of privacy -</p><p>Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop.</p><p>That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties.</p><p>One recent revelation showed that Google is mining the medical data of millions of people, in a bid to access what observers think will be the next frontier of growth in tech - healthcare.</p><p>\"People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,\" said Bindels.</p><p>\"There's a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It's just another currency.\"</p><p>For Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, that tradeoff amounts to a \"Faustian bargain\" which imperils our human rights.</p><p>- Tech wars -</p><p>To Beijing's anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs.</p><p>Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US tech sanctions would only encourage China to stand on its own feet.</p><p>\"In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,\" he said.</p><p>Samm Sacks, an expert on China's digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses.</p><p>The two countries have cooperated in research, \"and severing that could have global consequences\", she warned.</p><p>- Taxing times -</p><p>The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media.</p><p>Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a \"unified approach\" for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants.</p><p>Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another potential front in Trump's multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods.</p><p>jit-burs/bcp/jh/kaf</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/90/157553034126.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/90/157553034126.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-161326120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNH-GF51-F11P-X2B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

And it may even be ready in 2020 Photo: AFP / LLUIS GENE  Super-fast fifth-generation network speeds are meant to revolutionize communications along with areas like urban transport -- driverless cars plying our streets safely could finally become reality.But so far, 5G has failed to meet expectations due to the lagging build of infrastructure in many places. Apple has yet to launch a compatible phone, unlike rivals including Samsung.The rollout should quicken next year as more countries install base stations and networking equipment -- although US President Donald Trump's war on Chinese sector leader Huawei remains a wild card.As smartphone sales plateau around the world, manufacturers have been focussing more on ancillary services.\"You have to sell the entire experience, the entire ecosystem,\" Dominique Bindels, senior analyst for home and tech with London-based research firm Euromonitor International, told AFP. Privacy is 'just another currency' Photo: AFP / Pau Barrena Highlighting Apple's success in payments and peripheral devices such as AirPods, Bindels predicted that smart earphones, along with speakers and at-home devices connected on the \"internet of things\", would be among the more dynamic sectors in 2020.Another trend could be consolidation in TV streaming, after Apple and Disney joined Netflix, Amazon Video and some national broadcasters in a crowded subscription market.For the industry at large, business consultancy Accenture this year coined the acronym DARQ to denote four major trends: distributed ledger technology (such as blockchain), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality and quantum computing. Tax 'em more? Break 'em up? The debate won't end in 2020 Photo: AFP / Lionel BONAVENTURE Unbreakable blockchain networks of computers have already been generating virtual currencies in the form of bitcoin and its ilk, bypassing the need for a regulator like a government or central bank.Facebook wants to make the tech respectable through its \"Libra\" project, but has hit political opposition around the world, and several financial partners have pulled out.Unwilling to let private enterprise dictate terms, China and other nations are building their own digital payments systems, which could see fruition next year.However, blockchain networks devour huge amounts of energy, and concerns will mount about their environmental impact as debate intensifies more broadly about tech's contribution to climate change. Will we fall in love again with tech in 2020? Photo: AFP / JOSEP LAGO Most companies are now actively engaged across the spectrum of another tech acronym, SMAC: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. For consumers, SMAC is felt in how we communicate with friends and how we search and shop.That is accentuating fears about privacy, after a series of data leaks at Facebook laid bare how much of our online lives are exploited by companies and political parties.One recent revelation showed that Google is mining the medical data of millions of people, in a bid to access what observers think will be the next frontier of growth in tech -- healthcare.\"People are becoming more conscious of sharing data but also in the same moment, the Nest cameras and smart speakers are flying off the shelves,\" said Bindels.\"There's a huge divide. People have been learning to trade privacy for convenience. It's just another currency.\"For Amnesty International, in a hard-hitting study last month into Facebook and Google, that tradeoff amounts to a \"Faustian bargain\" which imperils our human rights.To Beijing's anger, Washington alleges that Huawei and another telecoms group, ZTE, are little more than shell fronts for Chinese spy chiefs.Ni Lexiong, professor at the Shanghai National Defense Strategy Institute, said US tech sanctions would only encourage China to stand on its own feet.\"In the end, once China has formed its own industrial chain in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will also lose a large market,\" he said.Samm Sacks, an expert on China's digital economy at the Washington think tank New America, said the tech standoff could harm progress in areas such as precision medicine and AI-based diagnoses.The two countries have cooperated in research, \"and severing that could have global consequences\", she warned.The US presidential election next November will likely prove another flashpoint over disinformation peddled on social media.Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants Amazon, Facebook and Google to be broken up on anti-trust grounds.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is meanwhile due by June 2020 to present a \"unified approach\" for richer countries to levy a digital tax on internet giants.Some like France have gone ahead with their own tax, igniting another potential front in Trump's multifaceted trade wars as the US threatens tariffs on a range of French goods. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767157552474073925876100093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNJ-0KM1-JCMN-Y291-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><timeReceived>5:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Spotify, the music streaming app, criticised Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company Basecamp attacked Apple\u2019s \u201chighway robbery rates\u201d on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.    Now these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and \u201cprotect the app economy\u201d. The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and Hinge.      \u201cThey\u2019ve collectively decided, \u2018We\u2019re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be \u201ca voice for many.\u201d    Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected to file an antitrust case against Google as soon as next week, focused on the company\u2019s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in a high-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple\u2019s App Store tactics and are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in internet commerce.    For years, smaller rivals were loath to speak up against the mammoth companies for fear of retaliation. But the growing backlash has emboldened them to take action.    At the heart of the new alliance\u2019s effort is opposition to Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both also charge a 30 percent fee for payments made inside apps in their systems.    App makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they are competing with Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s own apps and their unfair advantages.    Apple has argued that its fee is standard across online marketplaces.    On Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles, outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.    Each of the alliance\u2019s members has agreed to contribute an undisclosed membership fee to the effort.    The coalition came together in recent months after discussions among executives at Tile, Epic, Spotify and Match Group, the four companies that have been most vocal in their opposition to the big tech companies, Maxwell said.    Some of the conversations took place after Apple and Google booted Fortnite from their app stores last month for violating their payment rules. As Epic\u2019s fight with Apple and Google escalated, Spotify and Match Group spoke out in support of the video game company.    Apple has argued that Epic\u2019s situation \u201cis entirely of Epic\u2019s own making.\u201d    The new coalition could spur more companies to publicly voice longstanding complaints, its members said. Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain.com, said his cryptocurrency finance company had joined the group partly because it offered strength in numbers.    \u201cCan they ban us all?\u201d he said.    \u201cI doubt it.\u201d    \u00a9 2020 The New York Times News Service    Dear Reader,   Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

Our state's pro-innovation, pro-entrepreneur environment has been carefully crafted and protected through public policy, enviable access to private investment, and arguably the strongest tech talent pipeline in the country. Though proposals for stricter oversight of technology firms are gaining steam globally, lawmakers in Massachusetts, including Governor Baker, have long recognized the value of the technology sector and its impact on the state's economic maturation of recent years.Thanks in large part to the rising prominence of the MA technology sector, the state's wage and salary annual growth in recent years has outpaced the national average, and our per capita gross domestic product is the highest of any state in the U.S. Our state is home to over 600,000 small businesses, which employ 1.5 million people. One point often left out of the discussion about how to bolster the tech industry and the economy, for that matter, is how much small businesses now rely on technology and digital tools to grow, hire, and contribute to that impressive statewide growth.My small business in Wakefield, Furever Linked[1], isn't that far from the Kendall Square innovation district, but in many ways, it is a world away from the technology-driven ecosystem of the state. </p><p>We design and sell physical accessories for pet-owners: things like pendants, charm bracelets, and keyrings featuring customers' pet photos. We're a traditional small business through and through, but we would not be where we are without technology products that allow us to easily customize our products for each consumer, reach more customers through targeted advertising, securely manage our online store through Shopify, and easily build a website and Facebook page to educate potential customers about our offerings. Technology companies have made being an entrepreneur easier. It is significantly easier to manage my business thanks to the magic of digital platforms that simplify website and app development, product design and manufacturing, marketing and sales, invoicing and accounting, and even pricing.Mass customization businesses like mine cannot succeed at scale without utilizing large data sets and data analytics that power effective digital advertising and intuitive platforms for customers to build custom products. We're not building a complicated algorithm or hammering out lines of code from our little office in Wakefield, but we absolutely rely directly on technology to succeed as a business. As a small business operator, I'm far from being an outlier in that regard. According to a Deloitte study[2], 84 percent of U.S. small businesses are using at least one major digital platform to provide information to customers. According to that same study, small businesses using digital tools earn twice as much revenue and are three times as likely to be creating jobs. Small businesses cannot afford to lose out on the use of these tools and neither can Massachusetts.While leaders in Massachusetts have been proud champions of technology for the most part, there has been a movement nationally and in many states to dramatically increase regulation of technology platforms. California\u2014often seen as a bellwether for states like Massachusetts in terms of policy\u2014passed a data privacy rule this summer similar to Europe's GDPR. It's only a matter of time before Massachusetts takes up the issue more aggressively too. California's law has already faced swift backlash[3] from businesses including retailers who are concerned what it will do to their customer loyalty programs, how it will harm small businesses' ability to deploy personal marketing campaigns, what it means for location-based services, and much more.I'm here to tell Governor Baker, the leaders on Beacon Hill, and our representatives in Washington that any substantial changes to the way technology is policed must take into consideration the value that technology has for small business and entrepreneurs in the state, so that they're protected and cared for when it comes to access to digital platforms. Restricting access to those digital tools and platforms could be devastating to the small business heartbeat of Massachusetts.I urge policymakers to consider the harm done to small businesses if access to digital tools is meaningfully disrupted. Policies that do not consider how small businesses value these technology platforms would seriously harm small businesses like mine, which I cannot accept.As entrepreneurs use these platforms and grow our businesses, we do not want to worry about Washington and Beacon Hill politicians digging potholes and building barricades on the path to success. But I do worry every time I hear a politician attacking 'Big Tech,' digital platforms, artificial intelligence, data science and the companies that are a core part of my business. Fortunately, Governor Baker and Beacon Hill know that Massachusetts led the enterprise digital revolution for decades, and they ensure that the same pro-innovation spirit that supported DEC, EMC and Akamai now supports dozens of incubators, thousands of laboratories and myriad startups.If regulation makes digital business tools no longer available, too expensive, or inhibits the next generation of innovation, my business and many more small businesses could be hurt and our entrepreneurial economy undermined. I'm sure that Governor Baker and Senators Warren and Markey don't want that to happen.

The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking[1]\u00a0(PDF) will create a framework to 'unlock the box' and provide innovators, device manufacturers and app developers with the information needed to develop new technologies that 'reflect how consumers access their subscription video programming today,' said a press release[2] announcing the proposal. In outlining its reasons for the rule, the FCC said that pay-TV subscribers have 'limited choices' because cable and satellite providers have 'locked up the market' and that this lack of competition has led to high prices being paid by consumers \u2014 $231 annually on average \u2014 to lease the devices. The FCC also cited the fact that, since 1994, the cost of set-top boxes has risen 185 percent while the cost of computers, televisions and mobile devices has dropped by 90 percent. </p><p>According to the FCC, consumers who enjoy their current set-up through the cable or satellite provider would not have to take any action. The proposed rule only applies to those looking for a competitive device or app.Opposition to Proposed 'Unlock the Box' RuleNot everyone agrees with the proposed 'unlock the box' rule, particularly two organizations that represent small business interests: the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy and the Small Business ...trepreneurship (SBE) Council, a non-profit advocacy group based in D.C.SBA Office of Advocacy: Exempt Small Providers from the RuleThe SBA Office of Advocacy said in an 'ex parte' letter to the FCC[3] that the proposed 'unlock the box' rule should include an exemption for small 'multi-channel video programming distributors' (MVPDs) \u2014 cable companies \u2014 due to the adverse financial impact the ruling could have. 'Numerous commenters, including small MVPDs, as well as public interest groups and technology companies supporting the rule, have indicated to the FCC that the proposed rule will disproportionately affect small MVPDs,' the Office of Advocacy letter said. Advocacy stated that the FCC published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) with the proposal, but did not quantify the exact nature of the impact the rule would have on small MVPDs. It recommended that the FCC conduct further analysis to make that determination. In an email to Small Business Trends, an Office of Advocacy spokesperson said, 'The small business exemption we support applies to providers that represent a very small share of the overall customers. As a result, we expect that such an exemption will not impede the progress of set top box innovation, but will merely prevent smaller cable providers from exiting the market altogether and allow them to continue to offer competitive services.'SBE Council: Don't Create a Problem Where None ExistsImpeding small cable providers' progress is not the concern of the SBE Council. Rather, it's that the 'Unlock the Box' ruling creates a problem where none exists. In a letter to the FCC, Karen Kerrigan, the Council's president and CEO, said, 'Quite frankly, [the] SBE Council does not understand what problem the FCC is trying to fix\u00a0because there is none.' Her contention is that unlocking set-top boxes will create challenges and barriers for entrepreneurs and innovative programmers, many of whom are small business entities themselves. 'Big tech companies will be enriched and feed off of their work, while consumers will be deprived the niche programming that has emerging the current dynamic market,' she said, adding that the Council and its members are 'baffled' by the proposal given the array of choices available to consumers today. Kerrigan told Small Business Trends in an email that, 'No one asked for the proposal or benefits from it except Google.' She added that the proposal represents 'backward thinking' and that the FCC seems 'totally detached from what is happening in the current marketplace.' In a letter to Small Business Trends, Ray Keating, SBE Council's chief economist, called the proposed ruling 'bewildering,' saying that it seems to be another case of 'the FCC searching for a problem to regulate' that doesn't exist. 'Innovators in the market are providing and working to further expand consumer video choices,' he said. 'You would be hard pressed to name another private market in the U.S. that is seeing more disruption and change all to the benefit of consumers.' To Keating's point, one cable provider, Comcast, has already begun the process of innovation. According to Wired[4], Comcast will make its Xfinity app, which lets customers access cable TV, on-demand programs and a cloud-based DVR, available on Roku devices and Samsung Smart TVs, as well as on the hardware of other partners to be named later. That's not the only plan for set-top box liberation that Comcast has in the works either. Earlier this month, technology website Recode reported that the cable provider had inked a deal with Netflix[5] to offer the Internet television service on its X1 set-top boxes sometime this year, side-stepping streaming devices, such as Apple TV, Roku and Google's Chromecast.Dissent by FCC CommissionersNot all the FCC commissioners are on board with the proposed 'Unlock the Box' ruling, either. In a dissenting statement[6]\u00a0(PDF), Commissioner Ajit Patel said, 'As someone with three set-top boxes in my home, I share the frustrations felt by millions of Americans \u2026 These boxes are clunky and expensive, and I feel pain each and every month when I pay my video bill.' Patel called the set-top box marketplace a 'product of an intrusive regulatory regime' and that 'something has to change.' His advice, however, is rather than unlocking the box, eliminate it altogether. 'If you are a cable customer, and you don't want to have a set-top box, you shouldn't be required to have one,' Patel said. Another Commissioner, Michael O'Reilly, in a\u00a0dissenting statement[7] (PDF), called set-top boxes 'relics of the past' that are 'well on their way to the fate of the video rental store.' He questioned why, in 2016, with so many choices already available for television viewing, the FCC would\u00a0be doing a set-top box item. 'If the idea of an agency maintaining its regulatory control by placing outdated regulations on new technologies sounds familiar, you may be on the right track,' he said in the statement.SummaryThe FCC wants to unlock the set-top box and open up opportunities for technology development and advancement. The Commission's attempt to solve one problem \u2014 providing consumers with more choice in video viewing \u2014 has created another. And it's one that affects small businesses in particular. The Office of Advocacy says that problem is the adverse (yet unspecified) impact the ruling will have on small cable providers and recommends that an exemption be put in place to protect their interests. The SBE Council asserts the FCC is looking to solve a problem that does not exist and, in doing so, could stifle technological development and advancement by other small companies, such as app developers, device manufacturers and others. In moving forward with the proposed ruling to 'unlock the box,' the FCC will, apparently, 'tie the hands' of one group or the other. It's a catch-22, the outcome of which won't be known until the FCC votes on the proposal at the end of 2016.

One is a multibillion-dollar software company in Silicon Valley with tens of thousands of employees all over the world. The other is a small Harlem spot that serves Chinese comfort food and is known for its tasty dumplings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But they both say Google is unfairly hurting their businesses, and they have a new audience in Washington eager to hear about it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  After years of showing little interest, Congress and regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department plan to scrutinize the power, influence and market dominance of Google, as well as fellow tech giants Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</p><p>  ''Obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,'' President Trump said about large tech companies in an interview on CNBC on Monday.</p><p>  Scores of other tech companies and critics, as varied as software firms and shoemakers or musicians and newspapers, have stewed for years over how, they say, some of the biggest tech firms have used their power and scale to bully them and upend their businesses.</p><p>  The government is listening.</p><p>  ''We're in the moment where regulators hang a shingle and say, 'We're open,''' said Luther Lowe, the policy chief at the reviews site Yelp and the loudest antitrust antagonist against Google. ''The dozens of companies who have been quietly venting in Silicon Valley can begin to form a single-file line around the D.O.J.''</p><p>Google, Apple and the other tech giants have pushed back vigorously against the idea that they act anticompetitively. They say that they compete with a broad array of firms -- not just online companies -- and that their services enable the growth of many small and large businesses. The big tech companies have assembled large teams of lobbyists to make their case.</p><p>  But when the F.T.C. asked for comments last year on whether the modern economy required a new approach to consumer protection and competition, the commission received more than 750 letters, many targeting the tech companies.</p><p>  The Retail Industry Leaders Association, the lobbying group that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers, complained that the internet was now at the center of consumers' decision-making and ''controlled by a relatively small number of highly influential firms.''</p><p>  Sixteen advocacy groups and think tanks jointly wrote a manifesto that argued for tough antitrust enforcement against the tech giants, accusing them of a wide variety of misbehavior, including mishandling people's data, crippling small retailers or causing internet addiction.</p><p>  And the Handpulled Noodle, echoing complaints from other small businesses, told the F.T.C. that Google sold ads on its listing in search results. The ads direct customers to delivery apps that charge steep fees and cut into the restaurant's already thin profit margins.</p><p>  ''As a small business, it's like David versus Goliath,'' said Andrew Ding, the owner of the Handpulled Noodle. The shop's Google listing is how most customers find his restaurant, yet, he said, he has no control over how his business is represented. There is no way for him to get rid of the ad next to the Google listing.</p><p>  ''Google is it,'' Mr. Ding said in an interview. ''I would love for small business owners that don't have the clout or the influence to have more say about how their business is represented.''</p><p>Google said it allowed companies to place ads next to the listings of other businesses to give users more options.</p><p>  The Justice Department is examining complaints against Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. will handle antitrust issues related to Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust also announced plans for an investigation into whether the tech companies stifled competition and hurt consumers. The first hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.</p><p>  In Europe, the authorities have been far tougher on the four tech giants. They have imposed about $9.3 billion (8.2 billion euros) in fines against Google in three separate antitrust cases since 2017. They concluded that Google had forced phone makers to preinstall its apps, favored its own services over rivals in search results and imposed unfair terms on companies that use its search services.</p><p>  In his interview on Monday on CNBC, Mr. Trump said European regulators saw ''easy money'' in imposing large fines against American firms. ''They are actually attacking our companies, but we should be doing what they are doing,'' he said.</p><p>News Corporation and Axel Springer, the biggest German publisher, have voiced concerns to European regulators about the influence of Google and Facebook over the news business.</p><p>  The publishers lobbied heavily for a new European Union-wide copyright law, passed in March, requiring that large internet platforms pay a license for content shared on services like Google News.</p><p>Oracle and Yelp have also taken their complaints to Europe. Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president and policy chief, said that Google's dominance of the market underpinning online ads had enabled it to stifle competition, including from Oracle.</p><p>  ''We'd like to be bigger. But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,'' Mr. Glueck said.</p><p>  There is a bit of a revenge back story to Oracle's complaints about Google: The two companies have been locked in a nine-year legal battle with billions of dollars at stake.</p><p>  Yelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site.</p><p>  In 2013, the F.T.C. closed an investigation into Google's search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes.</p><p>  ''For so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren't critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,'' Yelp's Mr. Lowe said.</p><p>  The European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon last September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them.</p><p>  A central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their platforms because that's where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions.</p><p>Apple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30 percent of revenue made through activity inside the app. Spotify recently argued to European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify's app and favor Apple's competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify's app is when it ''tried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,'' Apple said in a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn't get a cut.</p><p>  News publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.</p><p>Google and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.</p><p>Google in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.</p><p>  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.</p><p>  Musicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. ''Hopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,'' said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters.</p><p>Google has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify.</p><p>  Some companies that sell goods on Amazon have argued that they have to be on its site to reach customers. Yet they fret that Amazon can use data about their sales to develop its own competing products. The trade group for major shoe brands, including Nike, Crocs and Dr. Martens, asked the F.T.C. to look into the ''dual role'' of platforms like Amazon.</p><p>  An Amazon executive, Jeff Wilke, said at an event last week that those in-house brands were ''a tiny fraction'' of Amazon sales. ''We do not allow anyone inside Amazon to have access to individual sellers' data in order to build a private-label product,'' he said.</p><p>  A Senate hearing last month offered a preview of the potential drama to come in Washington.</p><p>  Brian O'Kelley, founder of an ad-technology company called AppNexus, testified  that in 2008 he invented an automated bidding system for advertisers that ''turned every ad on the internet into a real-time auction.'' AppNexus grew to 600 employees.</p><p>  ''Google's response to the threat from AppNexus was that of a classic monopolist,'' he said. Google told AppNexus clients that they would need to also use Google's ad technology if they wanted to serve ads on YouTube, he testified.</p><p>AppNexus's business slumped, and it laid off 100 employees in 2016. AT&amp;T bought it last year.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech? Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley.

We are losing our voice,\" says Anthony Cochenour, president and founder of Hoplite Industries, a cybersecurity company with 50 employees based in Bozeman, Mont.</p><p>Some members of Congress recognize the problem.</p><p>Republican <person><nameText>Sen. Jerry Moran </nameText></person>of Kansas acknowledges that lawmakers aren't sure how to write laws that focus on big technology companies and minimize the impact on small companies. He says the uncertainty has slowed legislation.</p><p>Moran is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee that deals with consumer and data-security issues.</p><p>\"It's one thing to regulate or influence big tech,\" he says. \"It's another thing to diminish the chances of new tech or new businesses from the beginning. There is no easy answer or path to that. That's part of why we have been stymied.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Washington is increasingly stepping in, with pressure rising to do more after incidents such as Cambridge Analytica's handling of data on up to 87 million Facebook users for political profiling during the 2016 election.</p><p>The incidents also reveal, at least to policymakers, the distinctions within the technology sector: internet service providers, content producers, social media companies, retailers, equipment makers and others.</p><p>Former GOP Rep. Chris Cox of California, who is now a consultant, says regulatory wrangling has grown complex with disparities among tech segments and big and small players.</p><p>\"The contest in Washington is not between the new and the old economy as it was in the 1990s,\" he says. \"Today, it is much more like an economic turf war.\"</p><p>Legislative measures could impede job creation at small businesses and stifle innovation. Yet doing nothing carries a risk of more data breaches and costly leaks and uses of that data. And in the case of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, the response could have an effect on elections.</p><p>\"We've been lightly regulated,\" says Mat Ellis, the CEO of Cloudability, a maker of cloud cost analytics tools in Portland, Ore. \"Now, we're wondering what's going to come down the hill next.\"</p><p>Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, used a speech in January to predict a coming \"techlash\" against the power of online platforms and high-profile mishaps including the theft or unauthorized use of data. He warned against \"overreach\" in any tightening of oversight and regulation.</p><p>Key congressional Republicans such as House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon and Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Chairman John Thune of South Dakota say that rather than sweeping new legislation, they are focused on closer scrutiny of tech behemoths such as Facebook and Google.</p><p>As they did in early April with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, lawmakers use high-profile hearings to pressure executives to tighten consumer protections, possibly averting the need for legislation or regulation.</p><p>\"It's a mature industry,\" says Walden. \"That brings additional responsibilities and oversight. They know that. They expect that.\"</p><p>Wide-Ranging Debate</p><p>The divide between big and small tech companies poses a challenge to lawmakers as they try to address contentious issues such as user data privacy.</p><p>For example, Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Marsha Blackburn has offered a bipartisan bill (HR 2520) that would require internet service providers and some websites to get a user's opt-in to share financial, health or web-browsing data and an opt-out for other data.</p><p>The measure would impose identical mandates on websites of all sizes that serve as search engines, require accounts and that divulge sensitive user data. But small operators voice concerns that larger rivals would gain an advantage since they could deploy more employees to ensure compliance and deal with any problems.</p><p>Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, says she would be open to revisions that could reduce mandates or provide exemptions for smaller operators, but her proposal has gotten a cool response from both parties and from a range of online businesses.</p><p>While the Blackburn bill appears to be on hold, big companies face increased scrutiny and are looking to engage with lawmakers to head off broad new mandates. They are willing to accept, and even ask for, legislation to deflect uneven new state rules, court fights and foreign requirements, says Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.</p><p>Castro points to European Union plans to implement this month a new data-protection regulation that gives consumers the right to request copies of, or removal of, their user data.</p><p>That has fueled interest in similar mandates in several states, including a California initiative that could be on the November ballot if it gains enough signatures.</p><p>If a number of states establish data privacy mandates, Castro and other experts say that some big tech companies eventually may prefer a national framework instead of a state-by-state patchwork.</p><p>Litigation Fears</p><p>The online trafficking bill that the Senate cleared, 97-2, in March illustrates the gap between big and small tech companies. The bill limits the liability shield for internet companies that post online material promoting prostitution or sex trafficking.</p><p>Some of the larger tech businesses helped modify the language in the law, and ultimately backed it.</p><p>But attorney Colin Sullivan of Patreon, a San Francisco-based membership platform for artists and content creators, says his 120-employee company could be vulnerable to frivolous complaints from conservative critics who deem some artistic material obscene or objectionable with the aim of forcing its removal, whether or not it's linked to sex trafficking or prostitution.</p><p>Elliot Harmon, a spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties advocacy group, agrees that smaller platforms face the prospect of \"ruinous litigation\" and will be forced to become \"much more restrictive\" in content they allow in order to avert such lawsuits, justified or not.</p><p>\"Our greatest concern is abusive reporting,\" Sullivan says. \"If you are large and established, you have money to burn on those things. If you are an up-and-coming platform, you don't necessarily.\"</p><p>Global Intrusion</p><p>Small companies also see risks in a new provision in the fiscal 2018 omnibus spending law that could expose them to requests for information, including emails and data, from foreign law enforcement authorities.</p><p>The law includes a provision allowing reciprocal treaties to extend the reach of U.S. and foreign warrants.</p><p>Microsoft says the law helped resolve a Supreme Court case over investigators' demands for emails in Ireland related to a drug-trafficking probe. The Supreme Court subsequently dismissed the case.</p><p>Small companies, which mostly don't have a presence outside the U.S., see a risk that the provision will expose them to requests for information from foreign law enforcement authorities for not just emails, but other data.</p><p>\"I'm not a German or a European Union citizen,\" says Cochenour. \"Why should I be subject to that? If there were agreements like that, it could be difficult for small technology companies.\"</p><p>Online Inequities</p><p>The FCC's net neutrality decision in December reversed the agency's ruling in 2015 that had given it more regulatory power over internet service providers.</p><p>But the repeal of the 2015 decision caused an uproar among online businesses that worry that internet service providers will use the change to charge more for fast content delivery, at the expense of content providers that aren't established enough to pay.</p><p>Large content providers also objected to the FCC decision.</p><p>But few observers think that internet providers like Comcast and Verizon would want to jeopardize traffic to Amazon or Netflix, or that those companies couldn't manage an added cost.</p><p>\"It's going to have a massive detrimental effect on small tech companies that will outweigh any benefits for small ISPs,\" says Celeste Edman, CEO of Lunar Logic, a digital content and website development firm in Eugene, Ore.</p><p>Big content producers would be willing to pay fees for a faster link to consumers, while smaller rivals would be less able to absorb such costs, she says.</p><p>Evan Engstrom, executive director of Engine, a San Francisco-based technology advocacy and research group, says tighter budgets and small workforces make small tech companies less able to adjust to regulatory changes. </p><p>\"When imposing new laws on the entire tech ecosystem -- whether it's a technological mandate or new form of liability -- it will always advantage big players,\" he says.</p><p>Tax Battles</p><p>Small technology companies say they hope to have more influence on online sales tax and data security legislation. Advocates say they want exemptions and other carve-outs for small companies.</p><p>Two longtime champions of Main Street retailers, Republican Sen. Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming and GOP Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, attempted unsuccessfully to attach language to the fiscal 2018 omnibus allowing states to collect tax on online sales from out-of-state vendors.</p><p>Now, Enzi and Noem are trying find other legislation to carry the provision.</p><p>Their worry is that the Supreme Court could first rule in a pending case pitting South Dakota against e-commerce firms that the state can collect such a tax, a decision that could unleash a wide range of state actions that leave small vendors scrambling.</p><p>Enzi is sponsoring a bill that would allow states to collect the online sales tax, but exempt those with $1 million or less in annual sales.</p><p>Noem is proposing a bill that would exempt vendors with $10 million or less in sales in the first year after enactment, and phase out the exemption over three years.</p><p>But even such exemptions won't satisfy some small business advocates.</p><p>Phil Bond, executive director of the We R Here Coalition, a trade group for online retailers, says the exemptions are too stingy.</p><p>He wants to set the revenue cap at about $30 million, close to the Small Business Administration's standard for an electronic retailer's eligibility for certain loans and contracts.</p><p>The tax overhaul enacted in December received support from many technology companies eager to get lower tax rates, but Engstrom says he and colleagues had to forge a last-ditch coalition of small companies to stop a Senate proposal to make employee stock options taxable when fully vested, rather than when they are exercised. Options are a popular way for startup companies to compensate employees. </p><p> Big market participants were willing to accept the change, but more than 500 investors and small company representatives signed Engine's letter opposing the change. The provision was left out of the final bill.</p><p>Immigration Issues</p><p>Big and small technology companies are also divided over potential changes to the H-1B visas given to skilled workers.</p><p>Some lawmakers propose to link the visas to a requirement that companies have a salary floor near the prevailing wage. The idea is that it would funnel more visas to technology companies, removing an incentive to outsource or find an offshore provider.</p><p>\"They have to take into account the practicalities of how startups compensate employees,\" Engstrom says.</p><p>Adding to the uncertainty are questions about measuring the changes' impact on a sector that may not respond in the same way as traditional businesses.</p><p>Michael Ewen, a finance professor at the California Institute of Technology, says small technology companies with scant funds have little flexibility in their business plans. </p><p>\"It's harder for them to pivot,\" he says. </p><p>But Ewen also says it's hard to predict whether legislative and regulatory changes will affect the pace of new startups, including initial venture capital financings.</p><p>The National Venture Capital Association says the financings have been flat for several years.</p><p>Engstrom and Castro say small companies have to work together to make their case. Engine does some of that work.</p><p>Other technology trade groups and state technology associations also offer smaller operators a forum to shape group positions on state and federal legislation.</p><p>But Skip Newberry, head of the Technology Association of Oregon and chairman of the Technology Councils of North America, says that's sometimes easier said than done. Companies find common ground on worker training and business incentives, but find it harder to unite on regulatory issues in which the companies aren't always in agreement.</p><p>Lawmakers are looking for ways to provide some legislative benefits to the small companies.</p><p>Two senators, Republican Marco Rubio of Florida and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware, are pushing a draft bill that would give startup tech companies more access to research facilities at national laboratories.</p><p>Source: CQ Magazine<br/>Copyright 2018 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

The testimony came as part of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into Silicon  Valley's biggest players that House lawmakers aim to wrap up \" with recommendations for regulation \" in the coming months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'It's like soccer,' said Kirsten Daru, the general counsel of Tile, which has accused Apple of acting anti-competitively. 'You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game at any time.'</p><p>The pleas for regulatory relief resonated with lawmakers, led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House's top antitrust committee. 'It has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online,' Cicilline said to open the session.</p><p>The hearing at the University of Colorado at Boulder put public faces on the pain caused by some of the largest tech companies in the United States. Cicilline and other lawmakers have sought to determine if federal antitrust law is sufficient to hold Silicon Valley leaders accountable \" and whether changes to federal law are necessary to address anti-competitive concerns in search, smartphones, e-commerce and social networking.</p><p>'I think it's clear there's abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,' said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.).</p><p>The House investigation comes as the federal government's two competition agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, proceed with their own probes into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has trained their sights on Facebook and Google, announcing wide-ranging inquiries of their own earlier this year.</p><p>A key leader in those states' efforts \" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser \" sketched out a broad, ambitious agenda for antitrust enforcement in a private meeting with U.S. lawmakers Friday morning, where he called on them to invest more resources in oversight.</p><p>'The idea we're not going to regulate tech companies is so 1990s,' Weiser said in an interview before he spoke.</p><p>At the hearing, Tile took issue with Apple for changes to its iOS software for iPhones and iPads, saying Apple's tools to help smartphone owners find their missing items largely mimic Tile's offering. Adding to its advantages,  Apple imposes tougher restrictions on how Tile and others collect much-needed location data, said Daru, the company's general counsel.</p><p>'Tile welcomes competition,' she said, 'but it has to be fair competition.'</p><p>Apple says its policies seek only to protect privacy, but lawmakers at times did not appear convinced, pointing to other instances in which the iPhone giant \" seeing a successful product in  Apple's app ecosystem \" launches competing services of its own.</p><p>'Once Apple has essentially decided to do the same, it renders all of those apps superfluous and unnecessary,' said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.).</p><p>Patrick Spence, the leader of Sonos, blasted Google and other industry players for 'using their power in one market to conquer or destroy nascent markets.' The high-end speaker company says in a lawsuit that Google unlawfully copied its technology, a charge Google denies.</p><p>PopSockets, a Boulder-based company that makes circular grips for smartphones, took issue with Amazon. David Barnett, the company's founder, fretted about restrictions Amazon places on sellers. He said PopSockets at one point tried to quit selling through the e-commerce giant, but severing those ties ultimately cost his company $10 million. Amazon has disputed Barnett's claims. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, which makes Web-based product management tools, said the digital ecosystem as a whole had been 'colonized by a handful of big tech companies.' He likened the current behaviors of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to some of the same practices that decades ago led the government to try to penalize Microsoft for antitrust abuses.</p><p>'Help us, Congress,' Hansson said, 'you're our only hope.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-dbb427b4-395f-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0W-SGC1-JBFW-C02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The testimony came as part of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into Silicon  Valley's biggest players that House lawmakers aim to wrap up \" with recommendations for regulation \" in the coming months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'It's like soccer,' said Kirsten Daru, the general counsel of Tile, which has accused Apple of acting anti-competitively. 'You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game at any time.'</p><p>The pleas for regulatory relief resonated with lawmakers, led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House's top antitrust committee. 'It has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online,' Cicilline said to open the session.</p><p>The hearing at the University of Colorado at Boulder put public faces on the pain caused by some of the largest tech companies in the United States. Cicilline and other lawmakers have sought to determine if federal antitrust law is sufficient to hold Silicon Valley leaders accountable \" and whether changes to federal law are necessary to address anti-competitive concerns in search, smartphones, e-commerce and social networking.</p><p>'I think it's clear there's abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,' said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.).</p><p>The House investigation comes as the federal government's two competition agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, proceed with their own probes into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has trained their sights on Facebook and Google, announcing wide-ranging inquiries of their own earlier this year.</p><p>A key leader in those states' efforts \" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser \" sketched out a broad, ambitious agenda for antitrust enforcement in a private meeting with U.S. lawmakers Friday morning, where he called on them to invest more resources in oversight.</p><p>'The idea we're not going to regulate tech companies is so 1990s,' Weiser said in an interview before he spoke.</p><p>At the hearing, Tile took issue with Apple for changes to its iOS software for iPhones and iPads, saying Apple's tools to help smartphone owners find their missing items largely mimic Tile's offering. Adding to its advantages,  Apple imposes tougher restrictions on how Tile and others collect much-needed location data, said Daru, the company's general counsel.</p><p>'Tile welcomes competition,' she said, 'but it has to be fair competition.'</p><p>Apple says its policies seek only to protect privacy, but lawmakers at times did not appear convinced, pointing to other instances in which the iPhone giant \" seeing a successful product in  Apple's app ecosystem \" launches competing services of its own.</p><p>'Once Apple has essentially decided to do the same, it renders all of those apps superfluous and unnecessary,' said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.).</p><p>Patrick Spence, the leader of Sonos, blasted Google and other industry players for 'using their power in one market to conquer or destroy nascent markets.' The high-end speaker company says in a lawsuit that Google unlawfully copied its technology, a charge Google denies.</p><p>PopSockets, a Boulder-based company that makes circular grips for smartphones, took issue with Amazon. David Barnett, the company's founder, fretted about restrictions Amazon places on sellers. He said PopSockets at one point tried to quit selling through the e-commerce giant, but severing those ties ultimately cost his company $10 million. Amazon has disputed Barnett's claims.</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, which makes Web-based product management tools, said the digital ecosystem as a whole had been 'colonized by a handful of big tech companies.' He likened the current behaviors of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to some of the same practices that decades ago led the government to try to penalize Microsoft for antitrust abuses.</p><p>'Help us, Congress,' Hansson said, 'you're our only hope.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-2df3fc4e398711ea95419107303481a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y13-KKD1-DYX1-H4BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 31 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0059: Unparseable date: \"0059\"EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The testimony came as part of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into Silicon  Valley's biggest players that House lawmakers aim to wrap up \" with recommendations for regulation \" in the coming months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'It's like soccer,' said Kirsten Daru, the general counsel of Tile, which has accused Apple of acting anti-competitively. 'You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game at any time.'</p><p>The pleas for regulatory relief resonated with lawmakers, led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House's top antitrust committee. 'It has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online,' Cicilline said to open the session.</p><p>The hearing at the University of Colorado at Boulder put public faces on the pain caused by some of the largest tech companies in the United States. Cicilline and other lawmakers have sought to determine if federal antitrust law is sufficient to hold Silicon Valley leaders accountable \" and whether changes to federal law are necessary to address anti-competitive concerns in search, smartphones, e-commerce and social networking.</p><p>'I think it's clear there's abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,' said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.).</p><p>The House investigation comes as the federal government's two competition agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, proceed with their own probes into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has trained their sights on Facebook and Google, announcing wide-ranging inquiries of their own earlier this year.</p><p>A key leader in those states' efforts \" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser \" sketched out a broad, ambitious agenda for antitrust enforcement in a private meeting with U.S. lawmakers Friday morning, where he called on them to invest more resources in oversight.</p><p>'The idea we're not going to regulate tech companies is so 1990s,' Weiser said in an interview before he spoke.</p><p>At the hearing, Tile took issue with Apple for changes to its iOS software for iPhones and iPads, saying Apple's tools to help smartphone owners find their missing items largely mimic Tile's offering. Adding to its advantages,  Apple imposes tougher restrictions on how Tile and others collect much-needed location data, said Daru, the company's general counsel.</p><p>'Tile welcomes competition,' she said, 'but it has to be fair competition.'</p><p>Apple says its policies seek only to protect privacy, but lawmakers at times did not appear convinced, pointing to other instances in which the iPhone giant \" seeing a successful product in  Apple's app ecosystem \" launches competing services of its own.</p><p>'Once Apple has essentially decided to do the same, it renders all of those apps superfluous and unnecessary,' said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.).</p><p>Patrick Spence, the leader of Sonos, blasted Google and other industry players for 'using their power in one market to conquer or destroy nascent markets.' The high-end speaker company says in a lawsuit that Google unlawfully copied its technology, a charge Google denies.</p><p>PopSockets, a Boulder-based company that makes circular grips for smartphones, took issue with Amazon. David Barnett, the company's founder, fretted about restrictions Amazon places on sellers. He said PopSockets at one point tried to quit selling through the e-commerce giant, but severing those ties ultimately cost his company $10 million. Amazon has disputed Barnett's claims.</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, which makes Web-based product management tools, said the digital ecosystem as a whole had been 'colonized by a handful of big tech companies.' He likened the current behaviors of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to some of the same practices that decades ago led the government to try to penalize Microsoft for antitrust abuses.</p><p>'Help us, Congress,' Hansson said, 'you're our only hope.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-2df3fc4e-3987-11ea-9541-9107303481a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y14-P7F1-JBFW-C0MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The testimony came as part of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into Silicon  Valley's biggest players that House lawmakers aim to wrap up \" with recommendations for regulation \" in the coming months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'It's like soccer,' said Kirsten Daru, the general counsel of Tile, which has accused Apple of acting anti-competitively. 'You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game at any time.'</p><p>The pleas for regulatory relief resonated with lawmakers, led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House's top antitrust committee. 'It has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online,' Cicilline said to open the session.</p><p>The hearing at the University of Colorado at Boulder put public faces on the pain caused by some of the largest tech companies in the United States. Cicilline and other lawmakers have sought to determine if federal antitrust law is sufficient to hold Silicon Valley leaders accountable \" and whether changes to federal law are necessary to address anti-competitive concerns in search, smartphones, e-commerce and social networking.</p><p>'I think it's clear there's abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,' said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.).</p><p>The House investigation comes as the federal government's two competition agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, proceed with their own probes into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust violations. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has trained their sights on Facebook and Google, announcing wide-ranging inquiries of their own earlier this year.</p><p>A key leader in those states' efforts \" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser \" sketched out a broad, ambitious agenda for antitrust enforcement in a private meeting with U.S. lawmakers Friday morning, where he called on them to invest more resources in oversight.</p><p>'The idea we're not going to regulate tech companies is so 1990s,' Weiser said in an interview before he spoke.</p><p>At the hearing, Tile took issue with Apple for changes to its iOS software for iPhones and iPads, saying Apple's tools to help smartphone owners find their missing items largely mimic Tile's offering. Adding to its advantages,  Apple imposes tougher restrictions on how Tile and others collect much-needed location data, said Daru, the company's general counsel.</p><p>'Tile welcomes competition,' she said, 'but it has to be fair competition.'</p><p>Apple says its policies seek only to protect privacy, but lawmakers at times did not appear convinced, pointing to other instances in which the iPhone giant \" seeing a successful product in  Apple's app ecosystem \" launches competing services of its own.</p><p>'Once Apple has essentially decided to do the same, it renders all of those apps superfluous and unnecessary,' said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.).</p><p>Patrick Spence, the leader of Sonos, blasted Google and other industry players for 'using their power in one market to conquer or destroy nascent markets.' The high-end speaker company says in a lawsuit that Google unlawfully copied its technology, a charge Google denies.          </p><p>PopSockets, a Boulder-based company that makes circular grips for smartphones, took issue with Amazon. David Barnett, the company's founder, fretted about restrictions Amazon places on sellers. He said PopSockets at one point tried to quit selling through the e-commerce giant, but severing those ties ultimately cost his company $10 million. Amazon has disputed Barnett's claims. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, which makes Web-based product management tools, said the digital ecosystem as a whole had been 'colonized by a handful of big tech companies.' He likened the current behaviors of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google to some of the same practices that decades ago led the government to try to penalize Microsoft for antitrust abuses.</p><p>'Help us, Congress,' Hansson said, 'you're our only hope.'</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-dbb427b4395f11eabb7b265f4554af6d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0W-MF01-JCDY-T02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><timeReceived>3:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story.</p><p>Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for big tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p>Tobacconists - the broader category which includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p>Two thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93% of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p>Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p>The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least nine people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p>In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years.</p><p>Those bigger players swung back into the industry when Prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country.</p><p>In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450.</p><p>There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14% of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said.</p><p>Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41% of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5%) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, snapping up smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels.</p><p>We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45% of a Canadian marijuana firm.</p><p>Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely.</p><p>But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3% of high-school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8% in 2017.

monopolistic power of the giant firms in the industry, including Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.</p><p>During testimony before a special hearing held by the House subcommittee on antitrust matters in Boulder, Colorado, the heads of smaller rivals said they are at a competitive disadvantage against the tech titans.</p><p>Sonos CEO Patrick Spence, PopSockets CEO David Barnett, Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson and Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru took the stand and told Democratic and Republican lawmakers about their struggles to gain a foothold in a marketplace dominated by the giant firms. </p><p>Big Tech firms often co-opt ideas for new products first developed by the smaller companies and then use their dominant position in the marketplace to undercut their competitors on price, the executives told lawmakers in Boulder on Friday.</p><p>In April 2019, Tile.com, which helps users find lost or misplaced items, suddenly found itself competing with Apple Inc, after years of enjoying a mutually beneficial relationship with the iPhone maker.</p><p>Apple carried Tile on its app store and had sold its products at its stores since 2015.</p><p>It had even showcased Tile's technology at a big event in 2018. </p><p>The startup had sent an engineer to Apple's headquarters to develop a feature with the company's voice assistant, Siri.</p><p>Then, in early 2019, Tile's executives read news reports of Apple launching a hardware product, along with a service that resembled what Tile sold. </p><p>In June, Apple stopped selling Tile's products in its stores and has since hired its engineer.</p><p>The smaller companies are seeking to urge Congress to look at how big tech use their considerable clout to hurt rivals.</p><p>Similar investigations are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission, and with a bipartisan collection of attorneys general from dozens of states.</p><p>'After thoughtful consideration and months of bringing our concerns to Apple through regular... channels, Tile has made the decision to continue raising concerns over Apple's anti-competitive practices,' Tile's general counsel Kirsten Daru told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing.</p><p>An Apple spokesman said the company has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device.</p><p>In September, House lawmakers asked more than 80 companies for information about how their businesses may have been harmed by anti-competitive behavior from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet's Google. </p><p>In October, Committee Chairman David Cicilline said he expected to have a final report on its probe by the 'first part' of 2020.</p><p>On Friday, Cicilline delivered a scathing statement against big tech. </p><p>'Companies... both large and small, have found themselves dependent on the arbitrary whim of these platform giants, one algorithm tweak away from ruin,' Cicilline said.</p><p>'Because their decisions are largely unaccountable, opaque, and result in sweeping consequences, the dominant platforms effectively serve as private regulators,' he said.</p><p>PopSockets, a seller of collapsible phone grips, testified against Amazon. </p><p>The company's chief executive, Barnett, said the firm started as a seller on Amazon's third-party marketplace and then sold items directly to Amazon as a vendor, but decided to end its relationship with the company after two years in 2018.</p><p>Barnett said Amazon required PopSockets to pay almost $2 million in marketing so it could market its products as originals in the face of a wave of counterfeits. </p><p>The online retailer 'frequently lowered their selling price of our product and then expected and needed us to help pay for the lost margin,' he said.</p><p>'On multiple occasions we found that Amazon Retail was itself sourcing counterfeit PopGrips and selling them alongside our authentic products,' he told lawmakers.</p><p>Amazon spokesman Jack Evans said PopSockets was free to choose which retailers it supplies and could choose to stop selling via Amazon. </p><p>Third party sellers continue to sell the product on the platform. </p><p>'We've continued to work with PopSockets to address our shared concerns about counterfeit,' Evans said.</p><p>Basecamp, which sells an online project management tool, complained about Google allowing competitors to bid to have their own ads run when its trademarked name was typed into the search engine.</p><p>It said the practice allowed competitors to purchase ads that made it hard for consumers to reach Basecamp's website, co-founder Hansson told Reuters in an interview ahead of the hearing. </p><p>The company has opened multiple trademark infringement investigations with Google but the process is 'onerous and slow,' he said.</p><p>'Google's monopoly on internet search must be broken up for the sake of a fair marketplace,' Hansson said. </p><p>Basecamp is now forced to run a more than $70,000 annual advertising campaign to counteract the effect, he said.</p><p>Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said for trademarked terms like names of a business, the company's policy balances the interest of both users and advertisers.</p><p>Google allows competitors to bid on trademarked terms because that offers users more choice when they are searching, but if a trademark owner files a complaint, Google blocks competitors from using their actual name in the text of the advertisement, Castaneda said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That reliance could make it particularly difficult for some companies to go public with competition concerns against tech giants such as Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Google can make or break any company in the digital media sector,\" said Jason Kint, chief executive of the online publishing group Digital Content Next. (The Washington Post is a member of Digital Content Next). \"They are the number one source of distribution and monetization more than any company on the Web. What benefit is there in crossing them?\"</p><p>The relationship-driven business culture in Silicon Valley could also make it harder for companies to voice competition concerns, one venture capitalist says.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, Silicon Valley is a very small community, particularly at the top,\" said Robert R. Ackerman Jr., the managing director and founder of the venture capital firm AllegisCyber Capital. \"People go out of their way to avoid certain types of conflict in fear of blowback and ending up on a pseudo enemies list.\"</p><p>That could create a challenge for House lawmakers eager to investigate whether Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are using their size and dominance to unfairly hamper emerging competitors. The top lawmaker leading the House investigation into competition in the tech industry says he is already running into this issue - and it underscores why it is time for Washington to step in and examine the consequences of concentrated power in the industry. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Rep. David N. Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the House lawmakers' antitrust probe, said last week that smaller companies' reliance on larger platforms \"makes them concerned about raising their voice, raising concerns about the monopoly power of these platforms,\" according to Reuters. </p><p>\"If you look at the size of some of the large platforms, their ability to exclude people from the platform can result in closing the business,\" Cicilline told reporters. </p><p>\"That's sort of the most dangerous consequence of this kind of concentration, is the ability to exclude rivals, put them out of business, diminish innovation, diminish entrepreneurship, diminish choices for consumers,\" he said.</p><p>This fear of backlash does not just apply to small companies, Kint says. He notes that Google, for example, is a major funder of media trade groups, think tanks and academics. </p><p> \"It's dangerous to bite the hand that feeds you,\" Kint said. \"Honestly, it's really the best symptom of the problem.\" </p><p>Fear of backlash from tech giants might not be the only factor preventing smaller tech outfits from engaging with Washington. Some venture capitalists said the companies' silence could reflect a general skepticism of working with lawmakers. </p><p>\"If anything, people worry more about government actions causing more harm than good,\" said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. \"To paraphrase [President] Reagan, for most Silicon Valley companies, the 10 most dangerous words in the English language are 'I am from the government, and I'm here to help.' \"</p><p>To be sure, a handful of companies have come forward with complaints about the tech giants' power. Google has particularly been in the crosshairs, as last week the chief strategy officer at the music lyric company Genius wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post describing Google's power as a threat to the open Internet. The review website Yelp has also emerged as a prominent critic of Google on antitrust issues. </p><p>But other, smaller firms may be more willing to take a more secretive approach to working with regulators than blasting the companies publicly. Federal regulators such as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are divvying up tech oversight and considering opening investigations into some companies, including Google. Any potential investigation could be a more confidential avenue for companies to share their concerns with Washington than testifying in front of House lawmakers. </p><p>\"People now can form a line around the block at the Department of Justice and speak under the veil of confidentiality,\" said Luther Lowe, Yelp's senior vice president of public policy, who supports greater antitrust scrutiny of Google.  </p><p>Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said he is not surprised by the antitrust scrutiny at home after the company has gone through recent investigations in Europe. He said in a recent CNN interview it is \"perfectly fine\" for companies to face increased scrutiny when they get big enough. He did note there are some benefits for companies to being big because they are able to make long-term investments in new technologies such as quantum computing without fear of short-term returns. </p><p> \"Scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\">cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-ec392eb8-9775-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-M161-DXXY-30N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He notes that Google, for example, is a major funder of media trade groups, think tanks and academics. </p><p> \"It's dangerous to bite the hand that feeds you,\" Kint said. \"Honestly, it's really the best symptom of the problem.\" </p><p>Fear of backlash from tech giants might not be the only factor preventing smaller tech outfits from engaging with Washington. Some venture capitalists said the companies' silence could reflect a general skepticism of working with lawmakers. </p><p>\"If anything, people worry more about government actions causing more harm than good,\" said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. \"To paraphrase [President] Reagan, for most Silicon Valley companies, the 10 most dangerous words in the English language are 'I am from the government, and I'm here to help.' \"</p><p>To be sure, a handful of companies have come forward with complaints about the tech giants' power. Google has particularly been in the crosshairs, as last week the chief strategy officer at the music lyric company Genius wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post describing Google's power as a threat to the open Internet. The review website Yelp has also emerged as a prominent critic of Google on antitrust issues. </p><p>But other, smaller firms may be more willing to take a more secretive approach to working with regulators than blasting the companies publicly. Federal regulators such as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are divvying up tech oversight and considering opening investigations into some companies, including Google. Any potential investigation could be a more confidential avenue for companies to share their concerns with Washington than testifying in front of House lawmakers. </p><p>\"People now can form a line around the block at the Department of Justice and speak under the veil of confidentiality,\" said Luther Lowe, Yelp's senior vice president of public policy, who supports greater antitrust scrutiny of Google.  </p><p>Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said he is not surprised by the antitrust scrutiny at home after the company has gone through recent investigations in Europe. He said in a recent CNN interview it is \"perfectly fine\" for companies to face increased scrutiny when they get big enough. He did note there are some benefits for companies to being big because they are able to make long-term investments in new technologies such as quantum computing without fear of short-term returns. </p><p> \"Scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\">cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ec392eb8977511e9916d9c61607d8190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-G281-DYX1-H3YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><timeReceived>12:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Never heard of them? That\u2019s normal - two of these projects never made it beyond the work table. Yet, amongst \u2018smart city\u2019 enthusiasts, they are household names. Songdo may have been the only project to materialise into a city, but all these prototypes reflect utopic visions imagined through smart city projects. Sustainability, interconnectivity, and optimisation of services are sworn of this promise land \u2013 but do smart cities come with a human rights cost?</p><p>Earlier this week, Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs released a long-awaited 1500-page master plan for a massive new smart city development in Toronto\u2019s waterfront district. The project encapsulates the two sides of debate around smart cities. On the one hand, the company promises a \u201cglobal model for inclusive urban growth\u201d that will deliver jobs and be climate-positive. On the other has been a chorus of privacy concerns from community groups to a former Blackberry CEO, with author Shoshana Zuboff describing the project as \u201cthe frontline of an historic contest between surveillance capitalism and democracy\u201d.</p><p>What are smart cities?</p><p>Smart cities have become increasingly popular in urban planning over the past 10-15 years. The industry is growing at a startling rate, and smart city solutions are being implemented across the world and increasingly in emerging markets - often with the backing of the United Nations through initiatives such as the \u2018United Smart Cities\u2019 programme.</p><p>These cities are presented as \u2018smart\u2019 because they are capable, through a network of interconnected devices and new infrastructure, to gather data about the environment they host and monitor, respond, report and/or adjust accordingly. The marketing material of private providers like IBM, Oracle, and CISCO uses sleek language to build fantastic visions for cities \u2013 Sidewalk Labs presents its Toronto proposal as the \u201cdream city of tomorrow\u201d.</p><p>Looking beyond the rhetoric, smart cities are fundamentally about providing data-centric solutions to urban issues. Indeed, smart cities are symptomatic of the Internet of Things - an expanding network of devices connected via the internet, from smart fridges to smart heating systems, allowing them to communicate to users and developers, applications and each other through collecting and exchanging data from their monitored environment.</p><p>The fact that smart cities depend on tracking and analysing vast amounts of previously untapped data on the movements and activities of an urban population means that, as appealing as visions of smart cities may be, they largely remain utopic, and in practice can swiftly become dystopic. The benefits of smart cities have been lauded, loud and clear. But the truth is that the introduction of fully integrated, data centred technologies in city infrastructures and management presents serious threats to human rights.</p><p>Privacy in public space \u2013 a thing of the past?</p><p>The aggregation of data collected through smart city sensors and cameras, found on rubbish bins, traffic lights, streetlights, manhole covers, CCTV and \u2018free\u2019 WI-FI can create an increasingly pervasive surveillance system, threatening privacy, freedom of expression and opinion, and peaceful assembly, and fuelling discrimination.</p><p>As cities collect larger amounts of personal data on residents, often without their knowledge or consent, the right to privacy in public spaces becomes more effectively eroded. Smartphones exacerbate data collection by sharing, for example, geo-location data and digital interactions with mobile applications and WI-FI providers, who are, in turn, able to share data with other service providers. Accordingly, the increasingly interconnected and digital nature of city services means that the very act of being in public spaces engenders data sharing.</p><p>Such infrastructure can provide state law enforcement and security agencies with the perfect tools to intrusively track and target ethnic minorities or other protected groups. In China, smart cities in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) already form part of the state authorities\u2019 systematic surveillance and repression of Muslim ethnic groups in the region. Facial and gait recognition, coupled with CCTV outside mosques, and powered by new artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics technology, enables authorities in XUAR to maintain a \u201cdigital police state\u201d.</p><p>There are also alluring opportunities for private companies keen to exploit data insights for commercial gains. Research by Amnesty Tech looking into the world of data brokers and how US consumer data could be used to profile Muslims, exemplifies the potential harms from further commercialisation of data through smart city solutions. As the article explains, \u201cEvery time you use your credit or debit card, enable WI-FI on your mobile, read the news online, tick a Terms and Conditions box, authorize an app to access your social media accounts\u2026the chances are there is a company out there \u2014 or several \u2014 vying for your data.\u201d</p><p>It is inevitable that data brokers will be bidding for data collected through city sensors, especially considering the personal and detailed character of that data. Aside from the obvious threats to privacy, the commercialisation of smart city data could also enable discriminatory profiling.</p><p>Crucially, in the same way that Facebook owns its users\u2019 data, smart city providers often own data collected through their sensors. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs has sought to quell growing protests against the project by making assurances that the vast quantity of data produced will not be controlled by the company but would be managed by an independent Urban Data Trust. But many remain suspicious of whether a company that shares its parent with Google can be trusted with such a valuable tranche of citizen data.</p><p>Privacy expert Ann Cavoukian, who resigned as an advisor to Sidewalk Labs last year in protest over surveillance fears, says the master plan still has fundamental flaws around data de-identification \u2013 namely, ensuring that any data collected cannot be linked back to specific individuals. This is a vital issue, because without strong safeguards it is surprisingly easy to \u201cre-identify\u201d anonymised data \u2013 and even seemingly innocuous data can infer very personal information about an individual.</p><p>But even before entering debates around data management practices, there is a more fundamental question: should we accept at all the trend towards tracking, analysing and monetising ever more and more data on our activities, which smart cities exemplify? This goes to the heart of the business model of companies like Google and Facebook, known as \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d.</p><p>Issues of the Private in the Public</p><p>The development of smart city innovations has been largely a matter for the private sector. Most city councils, initially at least, rely on private companies for the development and implementation of smart city projects. As such, these projects are typically designed to serve the incentives of \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, namely to amass vast stores of data on people\u2019s activities and mine the data to predict \u2013 and influence \u2013 behaviour, ultimately to drive profit through advertising.</p><p>As Sara Degli-Esposti, Honorary Research Fellow at Coventry University, explains, \u201cwe can't understand smart cities without talking of digital giants' business models (e.g Google, Amazon,Chinese Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent). These corporations are already global entities that largely escape governmental oversight. What level of control do local governments expect to exercise over these players?\u201d</p><p>In reality, the control governments have over these tech giants is very little. As the technology advances and data infrastructures take over city management, the result could be the complete transfer of public services to tech giants. \u201cAll because\u201d, asDegli-Esposti posits,\u201clocal government would have lost proprietary rights over the obscure, multi-layered data systemsdeveloped over the years and wouldbe incapable of operating it\u201d. While such detailed data in the hands of local government could also threaten human rights, these proprietary issues create risks that could reduce public control over how their own cities are run and governed.</p><p>Private-public partnerships are often bound by confidentiality agreements imposed for reasons relevant to the proprietary nature of the technology. This clearly makes it hard for citizens to scrutinise the systems being fitted to their cities and used by and on them. The illegibility of these closed source proprietary models raises serious concerns in regards to accountability and transparency related to the use of this technology.</p><p>Likewise, the \u2018black box\u2019 issue of AI \u2013 the fact that the decision-making process behind new algorithmic technologies will often not be traceable by and for those deploying it, nor by those affected by it \u2013 further obscures so-called smart city solutions and creates a trust deficit.</p><p>Increasingly, the business model of surveillance capitalism itself \u2013 the unprecedented level of data collection, and the concentration of power to a handful of unaccountable companies \u2013 is coming under scrutiny as fundamentally misaligned with human rights. We should be asking whether so much data should be captured in the first place.</p><p>A human rights-based approach</p><p>Human rights must be put at the centre of development plans for smart cities. Civil servants should have a deep understanding of the technologies they are contracting, and enforce public procurement specifications that protect against abusive or wrongful use of the technologies. Technology needs to have safeguards to ensure that its use is consistent with human rights standards. Ultimately, people whose rights will be affected by these technologies should have control over whether and how these new technologies are used through meaningful public oversight, consultation and control.</p><p>The rather unique case of Barcelona highlights how powerful a citizen-driven, democratised and smart city project can be. The smart city model that Barcelona followed brings together civic participation with new governmental infrastructure and emerging technologies. The smart city of Barcelona is built made out of three components: an open-source data collection and sensor platform called Sentilo; a second open-source platform that processes and analyses the data called CityOS; and a user interface level of service apps that enables access to all the data.</p><p>Since all the digital infrastructure of Barcelona\u2019s city model is open-source, this design helps mitigate the previously mentioned risks of profit-driven privatization and closed-source proprietary software, while allowing citizens to claim collective ownership of their data. All produced data is available for citizens as well as private companies and interested parties, yet the city with its people decide together the parameters of proper access that retain privacy and hence, preserve the ultimate collective ownership of data in the city.</p><p>While it is yet to be seen whether this model will be effective in protecting against human rights risks, Barcelona\u2019s design remains the exception, not the rule.

The privacy expert Google had hired to assuage concerns over the dangers of a neighborhood built to collect data on its inhabitants, has stepped down. A year into Google's efforts to build a mini 'smart city' on Toronto's waterfront, Ann Cavoukian,[1] the former privacy commissioner for the province of Ontario, announced that she was leaving her role as a consultant for the project. 'I imagined us creating a Smart City of Privacy, as opposed to a Smart City of Surveillance,' she explained in a letter. </p><p>'Your personal information, your privacy is critical,' Cavoukian has said. 'It is not just a fundamental human right. It forms the foundation of our freedom.'  It's commendable, this repudiation of Google on behalf of fundamental rights but also rather astounding if we're being honest\u2014and charitable\u2014to imagine a privacy expert believing that Google had ever planned to build anything other than a smart city of surveillance. Cavoukian's involvement in the Quayside project, named for the Toronto neighborhood where the proposed neighborhood will be built, had focused on the importance of masking the identity of people connected to the harvested data. 'I felt I had no choice because I had been told by Sidewalk Labs that all of the data collected will be de-identified at source,' she said.  This is how Google makes money: It collects data on people, places, and patterns of activity, on which it then runs advanced algorithms designed by some of the smartest and most innovative coders and engineers in the world, to create targeted advertising or to optimize efficiencies in processes. The whole digital economy runs on the creation of these information monopolies. The technologist Jaron Lanier calls them 'siren servers;' the, networked data collections extracted and controlled by companies like Google and Facebook that, like earlier resource monopolies, produce massive concentrations of wealth and power.  An article from August in Canada's Globe and Mail[2], details how the 'smart city' design optimizes and monetizes the information it collects and why that might actually be a net cost to the city in which it operates. The project is intended to be a neighbourhood with advanced technology- for instance, using sensors to capture information about users' activities \u2014 which means that intellectual property is a crucial part of its value. To some, that value could be enormous as cities around the world make better use of data in urban planning. Sidewalk Labs envisions countless possibilities, from robotic waste-sorting systems to predictive heat-and-electricity-use programs. Everything from the design of Quayside's buildings, to the unique ways it collects data, to the further innovations that could be developed by harnessing so much data, has the potential to generate IP that could be licensed globally - or become the source of further innovation by Canadian companies. Toronto resident and open government advocate Bianca Wylie has been warning about the need for more robust governmental checks on Google's smart city project from the very beginning. Wylie, the co-founder of Tech Reset Canada, describes her role as an 'advocate for the public good in the innovation economy.' Last November she appeared on the popular Canadian TV program, The Agenda with Steve Paikin[3], and got into a memorable exchange with the recently resigned Cavoukian where she laid out why the kind of individual privacy protections Google was offering and has since proven unwilling to provide, were inadequate and unrealistic. In an emailed statement to Tablet, Wylie said this about Cavoukian's resignation: Fearing the collapse of the project, Sidewalk Labs issued a panicked data proposal knowing that it was out of step with Ann's position. They pretend to engage people but continue to steamroll anyone in their path. We need a horizontal approach to data governance and data policies because data has many economic and non-economic effects. By focusing only on privacy, we can find ourselves plugging just one of many holes, which is in effect plugging nothing. Because 'siren servers' operated by companies like Google depend on access to bulk data\u2014the largest possible quantities of raw information\u2014masking the identity of the people behind the data, while not irrelevant, borders on a distraction. The raw data is like the grass a cattle farmer depends on to graze a herd. It's not ultimately what's being sold, and customers are only interested in their cuts of beef, but it's indispensable to the final product. Similarly, all the smart algorithms and advanced 'artificial intelligence' applications to set the temperature in your house, deliver the right search results, find the best sales, warn you of impending health complications, or save energy costs at your business\u2014every optimized facet of our big optimized world depends on getting that data. It's the fuel on which the whole thing runs.  'The 21st-century knowledge-based and data-driven economy is all about IP and data. 'Smart cities' are the new battlefront for big tech because they serve as the most promising hotbed for additional intangible assets that hold the next trillion dollars to add to their market capitalizations,' wrote Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie[4], earlier this month in an article about Quayside. Of course, profit is what's in it for the tech companies pushing for smart cities but how about the rest of us? We get competent governance, stable polities, and the effective provision of basic services. Better living through optimization and smart cities that promise to lower the transaction costs and inevitable frictions of human existence. Democratic governments think they can hire out for the basic service they're supposed to provide, effectively subcontracting the day to day functions of running a city and providing municipal services. Well, they're right, they can, but of course they'll be advertising why they're not really necessary and in the long run putting themselves out of a job. For us regular citizens the appeal is even simpler: we want our trash picked up on time, clean streets, reliable public transportation, super fast deliveries of exactly the right products. When our elected governments can't get even the simplest things done, it seems reasonable to turn to the optimizers par excellence in Silicon Valley. Just ask any New Yorker who counts on the subway whether, over the past year of incessant service delays, breakdowns and buck-passing by city and state government, they wouldn't have traded some privacy for efficiency, given up some democracy for a bit of benign authoritarianism, if it only made the damn trains run on time. The tradeoff comes in the loss of power over the institutions we have to live inside. The mayor may be a bum who you'd like to throw out but you get the chance to do that every so often, to hold your city council accountable, vote on new laws and generally participate in the whole motley gamut of representative governance. If you just think back to the Congressional hearings over Facebook's role in the U.S. presidential election, it's clear that we're already drifting towards an underlying expectation that the tech giants accept responsibilities as an unofficial arm of government. 'In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company,' future Internet world president and current Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg[5] has said. Former Google executive chair, Eric Schmidt[6], has talked about the excitement in the company about 'all the things you could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.' After the deal with Toronto was struck, the feeling at Google according to Schmidt was,'Oh my God! We've been selected. Now, it's our turn.' Whether or not most people consciously want to transition from democracy to some kind of digital technocracy,we seem to be collectively urging it on by asking the tech companies to take on more responsibility for the regulation of public life.  In the end, you can have your privacy or your smart city but you can't have both. The post Smart Cities for Dumb Humans[7] appeared first on Tablet Magazine[8].

Recommendations and the Way Forward 880 Conclusion 881</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since at least the early twentieth century, when the emergence of the automobile saved cities from being buried under the manure produced by their horse-based transportation system, technologies have emerged to help solve the unique problems faced by rapidly growing cities. (1) Yet, as with the automobile, no matter how rapid and seemingly miraculous a technological solution, it will create its own set of problems that need to be addressed. For a little over a decade, smart city technology has been promising to cure a wide variety of cities' transportation, financial, environmental, and social ills. (2) But unresolved concerns about smart city technology, especially relating to privacy, are increasingly delaying the development and implementation of these technologies in democracies.</p><p>To explore the themes and issues outlined above, this Article takes a comparative approach to the challenges that smart cities face. Specifically, we compare how concerns about smart city technology play out in wealthy democracies (3) and contrast this with the relatively unchallenged rollout of that technology in the People's Republic of China. These wealthy democracies are further divided into the European Union, where government regulation is stronger, and North America, where smart cities have faced less regulation, but perhaps, as a result, more popular resistance. (4)</p><p>Part I of this Article reviews the rise of cities and smart city technology. We assess the (over)promise of the technology and examine the increasing pushback and skepticism that smart city projects and related technology have attracted. In Part II, we turn our attention to the case of China, examining four different uses of smart city technology: Alibaba's City Brain, the monitoring of Xinjiang, the social credit system, and other uses of facial recognition technology. Part II then draws overall lessons from these Chinese cases.</p><p>Part III of this Article considers possibilities for improving the use, regulation, and development of smart city technology in wealthy democracies. First, we consider the important role surveillance intermediaries could play in protecting privacy. Second, we look at the European Union and its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Third, we ask whether it is, at this point, possible for companies based in democracies to catch up with the development of Chinese smart city technology. Fourth, we look at how and where competition for smart city technology could play out in the rest of the world.</p><p>Part IV provides recommendations about a possible way forward in the development of smart cities that would protect privacy and engender public trust and support.</p><p>I. SMART CITIES</p><p>Rapid global urbanization driven by overall population increase and rural-to-urban migration is expected to reach 60% of the world's population by 2030, and 68% by 2050. (5) Across the world, urbanization has been closely tied with lower overall poverty rates, higher educational levels, and higher living standards. It is the main reason people choose to move to cities: the lure of higher-paying jobs and greater opportunities. McKinsey projects that the top 100 global cities by economic growth will contribute 35% of the world's GDP growth from 2007 to 2025. (6) Cities are seen as engines of progress, improved services, and technological advancement.</p><p>However, city development also produces unintended negative effects. For example, cities are major contributors to climate change. While they house 55% of the world's population (7) on only 2% of the Earth's surface, cities consume 78% of the world's energy and produce more than 60% of the world's greenhouse gases. (8) City residents' reliance on fossil fuels to drive their cars, heat their homes, and run their factories worsen air and water quality and harm wildlife and its habitats. (9) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 80% of urban inhabitants are exposed to levels of air pollution above WHO limits which, in turn, increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, and other chronic and acute respiratory diseases especially for elderly, youth, and marginalized groups. (10) Globally, urban areas have, on average, 50% less species richness (11) than intact natural habitats. (12) As Dr. Eric Strauss, executive director of the Center for Urban Resilience at Loyola Marymount University-Los Angeles, notes: \"When you have an intact animal diversity, you control those zoonatic diseases without having to use as much pesticide.\" (13) More frequent and severe extreme weather, such as hurricanes, heat waves, and drought, have not only damaged infrastructure and food economies but have also widened socio-economic inequality between those who have the resources and physical strength to withstand it, and those who do not. (14) The urban poor often live in areas of greatest risk (for example, older homes in flood zones) and have fewer resources (such as home and health insurance), information, and financial networks to avoid, prepare for, and address those risks. (15)</p><p>A. The Rise of Smart Cities</p><p>The problems that have accompanied urbanization have forced many to rethink how we build and maintain cities. Cities can still be an overall positive force, and proactive city leaders are increasingly galvanized to create change. Mayors from all over the world are coming together to share ideas and solutions over their common urban problems. (16) Despite differences in development levels, politics, and geographies, cities are increasingly expected to do more with fewer financial resources, (17) poor infrastructure, (18) and an aging workforce. (19) For example, Indianapolis requires ten times the current budget to achieve basic fair conditions for roads, (20) typical of many cities. As Zach Adamson, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council's Public Works Committee, noted, \"The city is always behind, there is not enough revenue to cover our needs.\" (21)</p><p>Organizations like the C40, (22) Rockefeller Foundation, (23) and Bloomberg Philanthropies (24) have become bastions of mayoral collaboration and have heightened the sense of urgency and opportunity for cities to be transformative. These coalitions have tried to take best practices and innovations from industry, both in process and in outcome, and seed them in cities. Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, naturally brought his managerial style and industry expertise from running New York City, where he was famous for saying, \"In God we trust. Everyone else bring data.\" (25)</p><p>Industry, in turn, witnessed its own technological breakthroughs and was eager to proselytize their solutions and increase their sales, markets, and influence by working with and selling to cities. IBM, for example, promised a \"smarter planet and a new strategic agenda for progress and growth.\" (26) Cisco solutions claim that it \"encapsulates a new way of thinking about how communities are designed, built, managed, and renewed to achieve social, economic, and environmental sustainability.\" (27) Start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and consultancies naturally joined, each offering their own solutions and analysis to support cities.</p><p>It is this confluence of urgency and expectation in cities, and the increased ability with industry-led solutions and optimism, that birthed smart cities. (28) By 2025, the smart cities market is estimated to be worth $2.4 trillion. (29) The convergence is also resulting in more flexible and diverse jobs that are newly created or replacing lower-skilled jobs. (30) McKinsey estimates that 15% of our global workforce, or 400 million workers, could be displaced by automation from 2016-2030. (31) However, the same McKinsey analysis shows an \"additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce (555 million and 890 million jobs) to 2030, more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost.\" (32) Many of the new jobs created are ones we currently have a hard time imagining and are based on emerging technology that is becoming part of our built environment. For example, Accenture estimates that the fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) rollout could create 3 million direct U.S. jobs and an additional 2.2 million jobs that support the 5G economic ecosystem. (33)</p><p>B. The Overpromise of Smart Cities</p><p>Nothing could be a clearer sign of the hype that surrounds the smart city than the multitude of definitions for \"smart city\" that exist; the term is most frequently used without any clear or consistent definition in mind. In an article for the Journal of Urban Technology, Vito Albino, Umberto Berardi, and Rosa Maria Dangelico collected 23 distinct definitions of smart cities from authoritative sources. (34) Liviu-Gabriel Cretu provides a useful breakdown of the two major trends in smart city thinking: \"(1) smart cities should do everything related to governance and economy using new thinking paradigms and (2) smart cities are all about networks of sensors, smart devices, real-time data and ICT integration in every aspect of human life.\" (35)</p><p>In this Article, we eschew a specific definition in favor of considering examples and technologies that are included in projects or articles that brand themselves as being about smart cities. If we were to exclude these for not fitting a narrower and more precise definition of smart city, we risk missing how less-related technology and examples get brought into the discourse on smart cities. Two examples from the subsequent Section, Quayside's wooden construction and the Facebook data breaches, illustrate how concepts that might not fit many definitions of smart city technology nevertheless may be held back by (in the case of the former) or contribute to (in the case of the latter) the pushback against smart cities.</p><p>Smart city solutions were originally seen as a way to solve many of the problems plaguing cities. With better technology and mastery of data analytics, cities could become more efficient at providing basic services like waste and recycling collection, (36) identifying potholes, (37) and abating pests and rats. (38) The technologies were also supposed to tackle larger problems like public safety and traffic congestion. McKinsey estimates that smart mobility applications (including smarter public transit, self-driving electric vehicles, ride-hailing, and car, bicycle, and scooter-sharing) (39) have the potential to cut commuting times for developing cities by 15% to 20%. (40)</p><p>However, almost as soon as smart city technologies began to be applied, it became apparent that the technology-driven approach of smart cities was insufficient to achieve cities' goals; sensors designed to notify drivers of free parking spots or public charging stations for electric vehicles needed trained staff for installation and maintenance. (41) While there were common problems, the one technology solution fits all approach was not effective--tech companies and vendors were driven by the sales of their products and services, rather than by development, such that it became a race to have their technology adopted by as many cities as possible for domain supremacy. (42) Cities purchased smart city technology falsely thinking that technology alone would make the city smart with limited knowledge in the application and usage of the technology, and left unsure of the exact problem they were trying to solve with its implementation. (43) Smart city technology also widened inequalities within and between cities among those with the technology, connectivity, and knowledge to use it--and those without it. For example, while Flint, Michigan's water supply systems continued to deteriorate and poison its residents, (44) 200 miles away in South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's administration was able to work with the University of Notre Dame to install sensors under manhole covers and implement a smart sewer system. (45)</p><p>The smart cities backlash created new thinking about technology and its relationship with city development. Smart cities became best thought of not as an end state, but a continuous improvement process that allows cities and communities of all sizes to pursue the most suitable integration of technology and data to increase their quality of life. It concentrates on the local context and meeting the community where they are, as well as creative problem-solving with an enhanced toolkit that includes technology, data, as well as policy and financing solutions. Smart cities, such as Smart Columbus, (46) Chicago's City Tech, (47) and Dallas Innovation Alliance, (48) are utilizing this kind of empowering, people-centric framework, with new types of solutions and public-private partnerships. Funded by public and private grants, (49) the efforts include Multimodal Trip Planning Applications and common transportation payment systems, (50) and developing demand management opportunities to reduce freight delivery congestion (51) and open data initiatives. (52) Yet, even more rapid than the progress of smart city thinking and projects has been the backlash against smart city technology, which we consider in the next Section.</p><p>C. Smart City Skepticism</p><p>\"CityLab,\" The Atlantic's publication devoted to the future of cities, declared 2018 the year of the smart city skeptic. (53) Their run-down of the challenges that smart cities face included both meaningful setbacks to an important smart city project as well as more general and less immediate concerns, such as how the rise of autonomous vehicles might change city planning. The problems described were distressingly familiar, with violations of data privacy topping of the list. Singled out was the revelation that Facebook had given its business partners access to personal data, exempting them from its own privacy rules. In total, Facebook provided 150 companies, including Netflix and Spotify, access to user data that included users' private messages. (54)</p><p>In some ways, it is misleading to name the above Facebook example, and other similar violations of online privacy, as a setback for smart cities. Because the collection and analysis of data is at the core of smart cities, every blow toward citizen trust in data collection, analysis, and storage may ultimately have a significant impact on public goodwill, which smart city projects in democracies must rely on to progress. Indeed, this Article will show that it is precisely these types of concerns that are likely to impede the development of smart cities in democracies and ultimately allow the People's Republic of China (PRC) to control the future of smart city technology.</p><p>Setbacks to smart city efforts may come in the form of revelations that damage general public opinion about emerging technologies rather than events that are specific to the development of any actual smart city projects. Another major source of concern for smart city advocates and skeptics is that many smart city solutions were not as close at hand as previously thought. (55) For example, after years of predictions that autonomous vehicles (AVs) were just over the horizon, stalled development and a fatal accident have suggested that self-driving cars are decades away, not years. (56) AVs are more closely related to smart cities than social media, but would not necessarily hold back the other aspects of smart cities projects. Here again, China seems to have an advantage. As this Article demonstrates, Chinese citizens are less skeptical of new technologies, irrespective of how deeply flawed they may be. (57)</p><p>Closer still to the core of smart city strategies, car-, bike-, and scooter-sharing services have also come under increased scrutiny. (58) Evidence that ridesharing exacerbates, rather than improves both traffic and carbon emissions--serious problems that smart cities are meant to ameliorate--may be mounting. (59) Micromobility solutions such as bike- and e-scooter-sharing services have faced criticism over blocking sidewalks, breaking traffic ordinances, increasing emergency room visits, and causing accidents. (60) Cities, including West Hollywood, California, Nashville, Tennessee, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, have forced e-scooter-sharing services out of their cities; other local governments, among them Columbia, South Carolina, and Davis, California passed preemptive scooter-sharing bans. (61) Meanwhile, cities such as Atlanta, Georgia have pushed operators out with regulations, including high impound fees and a ban on night use. (62) Yet, e-scooters remain popular and can likely help reduce carbon emissions. (63) Most issues arise not from inherent problems in the technology, concept, or appeal, but in a lack of both physical and legal infrastructure. (64) Laws and regulations that apply to e-scooters are often unclear, and cities and scooter companies appear to be tacitly acknowledging, if not encouraging, rule-breaking by scooter riders. Mandates to wear helmets, stay off of sidewalks, and read voluminous terms and conditions are \"more honored in the breach than in the observance.\" (65) In this sense, e-scooters neatly embody the current state of most smart cities technology--an emerging technological solution lacking sufficient regulatory, legal, and physical infrastructure, and heavily dependent on public opinion for its continued existence and expansion.</p><p>Most ominously for smart city advocates, however, is the fact that the largest smart city project in North America has come under heavy public criticism. The Toronto Quayside project by Sidewalk Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google's parent company), which was supposed to be the first neighborhood built \"from the internet up,\" (66) experienced several major setbacks. (67) First, the board of WaterfrontToronto, the organization administering the project, experienced a series of public resignations and firings related to concerns over Quayside. (68) Saadia Muzaffar, a member of Waterfront Toronto's Digital Strategy Advisory Panel, levied a very public resignation, citing \"a blatant disregard for resident concerns about data and digital infrastructure.\" (69) Second, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association filed a suit against Waterfront Toronto in addition to the governments of Toronto, Ontario, and Canada. (70) The suit alleges that the \"Quayside Agreements empower Sidewalk Labs and others to effect historically unprecedented, non-consensual, inappropriate mass-capture surveillance and [the] commoditization of personal data of individuals who live in, work in or visit Quayside.\" (71) As a result of the popular backlash, the Quayside project has been significantly scaled back. (72)</p><p>To a certain extent, the setback of some smart cities technology and projects, like burdensome regulations on micromobility solutions and truncations to the Quayside project, was the inevitable result of a bubble of excitement and hype that was unsustainable and bound to burst. Yet, many of these specific problems are far from inevitable and are primarily issues tied to public opinion. Concerns about smart city technology, especially as related to privacy, should not be as damaging as they first appear and should be surmountable for two major reasons.</p><p>First, most of the setbacks related to smart city technology are centered around privacy concerns that, while important, reflect only a subset of smart city technologies. From wooden building construction to public transit optimization, to smart sewers and trashcans, many of the technologies with the most potential are uncontroversial. They raise few, if any, privacy concerns, especially if designed correctly from the outset. Returning to the example of South Bend, Indiana, the installed sensors under manhole covers dramatically increased the efficiency of water management in their sewers and allowed them to forgo expensive infrastructure upgrades. (73) As with any technology that attaches internet-enabled sensors to objects, many pieces of smart city technology are part of the Internet of Things (IoT). But sensors installed inside trashcans or under manhole covers generally do not present privacy concerns or a security danger if hacked. Projects can disentangle uncontroversial smart cities technologies such as improved construction techniques and materials, increased energy efficiency, and less-problematic sensors. Projects that focus on timber construction, optimizing bus routes, and unobjectionable sensors can advance while leaving behind technologies that rely on facial recognition, collecting personal data from smartphones, and other sources. Even if privacy concerns related to personal data cannot be overcome, it should be possible to move forward with many innovations, which raise fewer objections.</p><p>Second, privacy issues around smart cities arise primarily from concern over what private companies, such as Google's Sidewalk Labs, will do with the potentially tremendous quantity, and unprecedented quality, of data that smart city infrastructure allows them to collect. (74) Considering the high costs and technology involved in most smart city projects, private companies are probably an inevitable part of advancing smart cities. In the United States, repeated revelations about how large technology companies collect, store, use, and abuse our data has damaged the public's trust. (75) Yet, stricter laws and enforcement in the European Union have led to a higher level of public trust that private companies will handle their data appropriately--and face repercussions if they do not. (76) While it would be an uphill battle, companies and governments in North America need to help improve attitudes toward smart city technology by building a successful track record of protecting people's data, thereby making the public more willing to trust smart cities with increased data collection. Increased trust that data is sufficiently protected will ultimately increase people's trust in the companies collecting such data, as well as the government's regulation of these companies.</p><p>Increased skepticism over and pushback to even fairly straightforward applications of smart cities technologies seems likely to delay the development and implementation of smart cities in democracies. In a liberal democracy with a robust rule of law, new technology that interacts with the public sphere, as most smart city technology does, requires at least a reasonable amount of public acceptance of the new technology. This trust can be built with increased transparency, education, and open dialogue, which the public values but is ultimately a time-consuming process. The idea that deliberative processes in democracies would delay development that otherwise could rapidly move ahead has been seen in previous instances--as has the fact that the PRC often ignores these concerns and speeds ahead. For example, in 2008, The Economist noted that \"it took as long to conduct a public inquiry into the proposed construction of Heathrow's Terminal Five as it took to build Beijing's new airport terminal from scratch.\" (77) Because the concerns raised by smart cities are newer and more complex, the time gap between development in democracies and China is likely to be, and become, even wider.</p><p>Privacy concerns can hold up the development of smart city projects in part because many smart city innovations are popularly seen as making a relatively small contribution, or even as providing a frivolous luxury. Yet, delays in the development of smart cities projects are potentially incredibly damaging for two reasons. First, some of the problems that smart cities help address, especially climate change, (78) are so acute that there is little time to lose. Second, if companies in the United States and other democracies are substantially delayed in their development of smart cities projects, this will only increase the advantage of companies that are based in the PRC, which will then increase the use of Chinese smart cities technology across the world. (79) As this Article argues, the technology developed and sold by PRC-based companies is likely to lack basic privacy protections, empower authoritarians, and perhaps even make countries who utilize the technology vulnerable to the PRC.</p><p>D. Privacy Challenges for Smart Cities</p><p>Because almost any definition of smart cities involves the effective collection and use of data to improve city governance and services, concerns about data and privacy are inevitable and imminently reasonable. According to Lilian Edwards, Professor of E-Governance at the University of Strathclyde, the key security challenges faced by smart cities are: (1) a lack of meaningful consent; (2) private data collected from public interactions; (3) privatization of both infrastructure and data; (4) repurposing data from the IoT; and (5) storage of data in the cloud. (80) There is no perfect solution to these problems; a balance needs to be struck between protecting people's data and using data for the public good, from fighting climate change to improving city services. The costs in terms of lost privacy and other concerns need to be balanced with the lost opportunity cost of not implementing these technologies. Giving up on technologies that help fight climate change or provide better public transit and other city services to underserved neighborhoods may be too high a price to pay to protect certain types of personal data. More important than any specific solution to these challenges is the need for ongoing dialogue about how to handle data in an inclusive, consistent, and transparent manner, which will, in turn, facilitate meaningful trust among the public.</p><p>Public backlash against smart city projects has the potential to derail even uncontroversial elements of smart cities. The Quayside project, for example, intends to take unprecedented steps by using wood as its primary building material for buildings up to 35 stories. (81) Because concrete is a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, and wood is renewable, lighter, and an excellent way of storing excess carbon, the Quayside project could pilot innovation by making a major contribution towards climate change reduction. (82) However, while Sidewalk Labs tried to highlight its innovative wood construction, both the public and its own advisory panel pushed back against the project based on other privacy concerns (83) regarding how data would be collected and used by a private company. (84) Saadia Muzaffar, a member of Waterfront Toronto's Digital Strategy Advisory Panel who resigned, described the problem with the public consultation process. She argued that instead of addressing privacy concerns, \"time was spent [by Waterfront Toronto]... talking about buildings made of wood and the width of one-way streets, things no one has contested or expressed material concern for in this entire process.\" (85) If Sidewalk Labs and other companies spearheading smart cities efforts (86) cannot create strategies to overcome concerns about their projects, especially related to privacy, then even the popular elements of their plans might be abandoned--or at least significantly delayed. The cost to society and the planet in terms of lost opportunity could be significant. The opportunities that such delays present to Chinese companies, on the other hand, which have less concern for privacy and transparency, could be even larger. (87)</p><p>II. CHINA</p><p>Part II examines the development of smart city technology in the PRC. We give particular attention to four cases: Alibaba's City Brain, the monitoring of Xinjiang, China's social credit system, and other uses of facial recognition technology. Finally, we summarize and draw conclusions based on what these fairly different applications of technology tell us as a whole.</p><p>Across a variety of industries that include smart cities and related technologies, China's companies are increasingly competitive with their counterparts from North America, out-innovating them in a variety of fields, from artificial intelligence to 5G. (88) Several factors help make China a world-leader in smart cities: First, the tremendous size of the Chinese market, in terms of both population and GDP. (89) Second, the state uses strategic investment, tax incentives, and a variety of other inducements and policies to support Chinese companies, seeking to make the PRC a world-wide leader in technology and innovation. The \"Made in China 2025\" initiative has formalized these policies into a prominent national campaign aimed at making China a global technological superpower and costing the state at least hundreds of billions of dollars. (90) Third, the state further assists Chinese companies by blocking foreign firms from operating in spaces that it deems \"sensitive,\" especially search and social media. Prominent examples include the blocking of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. (91) This not only allows China greater control over industries and applications it deems \"sensitive,\" but has allowed other Chinese technology companies to fill a space that American firms otherwise dominate in most of the world. Fourth, and most important to our argument, Chinese companies enjoy an advantage when it comes to smart cities technology because they face relatively little need to deal with issues related to privacy, public opinion, or other concerns about the implementation of new technology. Chinese companies working in conjunction with the state can power ahead in implementing technology with little concern for public opinion and even less worry about legal or political setbacks of the kind Quayside faced.</p><p>The PRC's rapid rise to dominance in several high technology fields, especially renewable energy, provides an instructive example for the possible future of many smart city technologies. Beginning in the 1990s, China invested heavily in renewable energy with a particular focus on photovoltaic panels (PVs). In total, the Chinese state may have contributed as much as $47 billion to build its solar manufacturing industry. (92) The results were even more impressive. \"Between 2008 and 2013, China's fledgling solar-electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent.\" (93) China leapfrogged previous market leaders--the United States, Germany, and Japan--not only in production but also in patents. Its current market dominance in the industry seems, at least for the time being, unassailable.</p><p>It is often claimed that the Chinese are more likely to embrace new technology than people in other countries, especially wealthy democracies, because the population as a whole is less distrusting of it. '\"Chinese are much more willing to try something new just because it looks cool,' said Andy Tian, Chief Executive of Beijing-based Asia Innovations Group, which runs mobile applications. 'It sounds superficial. It is superficial. But that's the driver of progress [in the PRC] in a lot of cases.'\" (94) This general enthusiasm for technology may help overcome concerns about privacy and other issues. Some data likewise suggests that Chinese consumers are more comfortable with a variety of technologies likely to figure into smart city projects. (95) In the most extreme cases, Chinese and Americans take the opposite view of technology. A survey by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants found that 70% of Americans say that they would not trust an autonomous vehicle, while 72% of Chinese said they would. (96) Yet, not all results are clear cut, and the causes and nature of Chinese attitudes towards privacy and technology is worth further examination.</p><p>In 2018, the CEO of Baidu, China's biggest search engine, publicly stated: \"I think Chinese people are more open or less sensitive about the privacy issue. If they are able to trade privacy for convenience, for safety, for efficiency, in a lot of cases they're willing to do that.\" (97) The comments reflected a reasonably common point of view but were also met with significant public criticism. When it comes to online privacy, the gap between Chinese and Western attitudes is less extreme but still appears to be significant. A 2019 survey by Ipsos Group found that only 11% of Chinese were very concerned about their online privacy, compared to 26% of respondents in the United States. (98) The overall numbers of those who were concerned or very concerned were similar at 68% and 78% respectively. (99) Chinese lack of concern seems even more dramatic because it puts China in similar territory, primarily with wealthy and well-run democracies such as Japan, Germany, and Sweden. (100) Countries more similar to China, in terms of development and political system, tended towards the other end of the scale; in Egypt, India, Nigeria, South Africa, Mexico, Korea, Brazil, and Tunisia, over 40% reported being very concerned about online privacy. (101) That China looks more like well-run wealthy democracies than developed countries hints at a theme that will be examined later in this Article: for a middle-income authoritarian regime, China seems to be uniquely capable and trusted by its own people. (102)</p><p>As China becomes wealthier, better-educated, and more tech-savy, it is possible that attitudes towards online privacy are shifting. Both the Ipsos poll and a report by Kantar China Insights, a media consultancy, suggest that concern about personal privacy online is growing. (103) There is even evidence that the Chinese state is responding to increasing concerns about online data privacy. (104) China's new e-commerce law, which took effect in 2019, contains important provisions for protecting the privacy of consumers. (105)</p><p>How any given Chinese person or the country as a whole feels about sacrificing privacy may matter less when the state and powerful tech companies act as though Chinese care little about privacy. Ordinary Chinese people have relatively little control over the rapidly growing use of a wide variety of technologies with the serious potential to infringe on their privacy. (106) In meaningful ways, Chinese citizens have already been forced to accept technology (107) that many in developed democracies remain skeptical of or even openly resist. (108) In major Chinese cities, mobile phone-based payment systems, like Alipay and WeChat Pay, are so pervasive that using cash or credit cards falls between inconvenient and impossible, even for low-value face-to-face transactions like buying a bottle of water. Similarly, WeChat (Weixin)--an application that serves messaging, payment, and many other functions--is so ubiquitous that it is difficult to live a normal life or conduct business without it. (109) It is possible, therefore, that to the extent the Chinese do have laxer attitudes about potential privacy-infringing technology, this is a consequence of an environment where there is relatively little choice but to opt into such technology, irrespective of overriding privacy concerns. Additionally, the market dominance of a few national champions with close ties to the state gives consumers few choices in terms of competing providers that might take their privacy more seriously. (110)</p><p>The advantage that Chinese companies have as a result of being able to largely ignore privacy concerns and many other regulatory hurdles is clear to Chinese companies, the state that supports them, and their competitors. (111) In the words of Dong Tao, Vice Chairman for Greater China at Credit Suisse Private Banking Asia Pacific, \"I'm not saying Chinese companies are better than American companies, I'm not saying Chinese engineers are better than American engineers. What will make China be big in AI and big data is: China has no serious law protecting data privacy.\" (112) As the following Sections show, these advantages allow for Chinese companies to be involved in projects that companies in Europe or North America could not even contemplate.</p><p>It is unclear, however, if all the advantages that Chinese companies currently enjoy will last. Perhaps precisely because it is not a democracy, the Chinese state is very sensitive to public opinion. (113) Its supportive attitude of companies that care little for its citizens' privacy may change if the state becomes seriously concerned that attitudes of average Chinese people are shifting to more closely match the higher levels of concern visible in other middle-income countries. This would be similar to improvements made in air quality that China experienced as a result of public backlash against high-levels of air pollution, helping to shift the government's previously laissez-faire attitude about heavy polluters. (114)</p><p>In the Sections below, this Article considers three of the PRC's largest-scale and most Orwellian uses of data in the public sphere, as well as several smaller-scale examples of the use of facial recognition technology in the PRC.</p><p>A. City Brain</p><p>If Sidewalk Lab's Quayside project is the ambitious but problematic poster child for smart cities in wealthy democracies, it pales in comparison to China's most important smart city project, Alibaba's City Brain. (115) According to Xian-Sheng Hua of Alibaba Group's DAMO Academy (Academy for Discovery, Adventure, Momentum, and Outlook):</p><p>City Brain is an end-to-end system whose goal is to glean irreplaceable values from big city data, specifically from videos, with the assistance of rapidly evolving AI technologies and fast-growing computing capacity. From cognition to optimization, to decision-making, from search to prediction and ultimately, to intervention, City Brain improves the way we manage the city, as well as the way we live in it. (116)</p><p>In short, City Brain appears to be an effort to collect, consolidate, analyze, and implement as much data relevant to city functions as digitally possible.</p><p>Currently, City Brian has five major applications: (1) monitoring city \"vital signs\" such as traffic across multiple modes of transport; (2) monitoring for public security purposes; (3) improving traffic on a micro-level (controlling traffic lights and transit routes and departures); (4) route optimization for emergency response vehicles; and (5) assisting with urban planning. (117) According to Alibaba, \"utilizing comprehensive real-time city data, City Brain holistically optimizes urban public resources by instantly correcting defects in urban operations. This has led to numerous breakthroughs in urban government models, service models, and industrial development.\" (118) As with Quayside and other smart cities projects in wealthy democracies, many of the most beneficial applications of the technology, such as optimizing traffic, emergency services, and public transport, are likely to be popular and are relatively unobjectionable from a privacy standpoint. The public security applications, however, are a very different matter.</p><p>In a way, City Brain is the logical conclusion of an effort that started on the other side of the world when the United Kingdom installed four closed-circuit cameras in Trafalgar Square in I960. (119) Since then, the United Kingdom has led the world as one of the most surveilled countries, with a total of around 5.9 million closed-circuit television cameras. (120) While the amount of video collected is enormous, however, the system is old, \"a muddle of more than a thousand video formats, poor quality footage and manual processing.\" (121) The footage is used primarily as a tool for review by specially trained police to use after an incident has already taken place. \"In the aftermath of the London riots in August 2011 police scoured through more than 200,000 hours of CCTV to identify suspects. Around 5,000 offenders were found by trawling through the footage, after a process that took more than five months.\" (122) While meaningful efforts to modernize, improve, and automate at least parts of the United Kingdom's dilapidated system are underway, the process will be expensive and lengthy. As the United Kingdom advances these efforts, it has already experienced pushback about the use of facial recognition and biometric tracking information that the CCTV network would need to become more automated and produce data in real-time. (123) In particular--with the details of the United Kingdom's post-Brexit relationship with Europe still to be worked out--the United Kingdom's use of these technologies will face meaningful constraints in the form of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which this Article will later examine. (124)</p><p>City Brain's public security functions are essentially trying to recreate the efforts of the London police in 2011, but with automation, programming City Brain to work in real-time, and even make predictions. This level of surveillance may have already, or may not, surpass that of regimes like Communist East Germany (125) or, indeed, Mao-era China. (126) But even if it does not, City Brain efforts offer massive advantages in terms of efficiency and precision. At the time of its collapse, East Germany had more than 260,000 people, or 2% of its population, working full or part-time for its secret police. (127) The comparable figure for the PRC would be approximately 28 million, about four times the number of civil servants currently working in China. (128) City Brain would seem to be able to provide a similar level of surveillance at a tiny fraction of the cost. Additionally, according to Alibaba's researchers, the technology is both much faster and much better at identifying people than a human; they claim that the system was able to locate people in security footage from a single photo, even if that photo was from behind. (129) This identification technology has many worthy applications, from preventing terrorist attacks and mass shootings to finding missing children. Nevertheless, the potential for an authoritarian regime that could identify and track the comings and goings of every individual in a city in real-time is staggering and perhaps not that far off. The further the technology spreads beyond China, the more authoritarians or potential authoritarians could have access to this surveillance of unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>As with many smart cities or big data projects, City Brain collects and stores large amounts of data on the cloud. (130) The storage of such large amounts of potentially sensitive data poses challenges--even for companies in jurisdictions that are more concerned with data security and privacy. But large Chinese technology companies' lack of concern with privacy, and their close relationship with the state, make these concerns even more serious. (131) Without a government regulating the collection, storage, and protection of data and with little fear of retribution from a state heavily invested in its success, Alibaba--or any company in a similar position--has little reason to take adequate measures to secure its data and systems. Even fairly basic smart traffic control systems offer a prime target for hackers, (132) and as one of the most ambitious systems ever conceived, City Brian provides an expansive attack surface area.</p><p>Concern that Alibaba and those that buy its smart cities products will not take the security of its data seriously is more than theoretical. In 2019, John Wethington of data security firm Condition:Black discovered that a sizable Chinese smart city database was easily accessible online, not even protected by a password. (133) Although the owner of the data was not explicit, it \"made several references to the tech giant's artificial intelligence-powered cloud platform, City Brain, but Alibaba later denied its platform was used.\" (134) When the content of the database became clear, it not only raised concerns that such a large and sensitive dataset was going unprotected but also revealed the worrying scope of the data being collected and stored.</p><p>The unprotected data Wethington found was produced by the continual monitoring of \"residents around at least two small housing communities in eastern Beijing, the largest of which is Liangmaqiao, known as the city's embassy district.\" (135) The data is collected through various means, most notably cameras enabled with facial recognition software. Using the data, it would be possible to construct a picture of an individual's coming and goings. It also identified the ethnicity of individuals, a worrying prospect given China's recent record of targeting Muslims for repression, (136) but also in many other contexts. (137) More concerning still, the data collected by cameras and processed by facial recognition software was linked to government records, including national identification card numbers and police records. (138) This clue also makes it likely that the Alibaba customer to whom the data belonged was a Chinese local government. (139) In a similar breach in January 2020, City Brain data from the Chinese cities of Luzhou and Hangzhou were uncovered. (140)</p><p>Yet the worrying implications of City Brain's public security features and overall concerns about data collection and security are easy to overlook in favor of the tremendous potential of its other functions. Alibaba claims that its system is able to integrate data from map tools, traffic police microblog accounts, and videos to optimize traffic lights, taxi dispatch, and public transportation to reduce traffic, improve emergency vehicle response times, and reduce public transit delays. (141) The system was purported to be highly effective in its test city of Hangzhou, a major metropolis in China's silicon valley. After City Brain was given control of 104 traffic lights in one district of the city, traffic was reduced by 15% in the first year. (142) Additionally, in Hangzhou, ambulance response times dropped by 50%, and the accuracy of real-time traffic incident detection reached 95%. (143) In Shanghai, optimizing traffic light timing dropped travel time by 8% and roadway congestion by 15%. (144) Better still for traffic-clogged metropolises, researchers claimed that in Suzhou, in Jiangsu Province, \"dynamic adjustment of bus departure time increased the number of people taking buses by 17%.\" (145) If these kinds of improvements are substantiated and reproducible in other contexts, cities around the world will and should be clamoring to get their own City Brains.</p><p>While the scope and scale of City Brain are impressive, it is the possibility for the rapid spread of the system that makes it perhaps the most important smart cities technology on the planet. A system that provides cities some relief from congestion without major infrastructure spending could be incredibly tempting even for a wealthy democracy that takes transparency and data privacy seriously. For the rapidly growing and increasingly congested cities of the developing world (the four cities with the world's worst traffic are Mumbai, Bogota, Lima, and New Delhi), (146) many of which have limited legal and democratic constrains, the appeal of City Brain may be irresistible. City Brain is already being deployed in cities across China, including Xiong'an New Area (near Beijing and Tianjin), Chongqing, Macau, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou. (147) Beyond China, Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, has already signed a contract to implement City Brain, (148) and if things go according to plan, this will be only the tip of the iceberg. Alibaba claims it \"is already working with 120,000 developers and 2700 academic institutes and businesses from 77 countries and regions.\" (149)</p><p>Utility notwithstanding, there are good reasons to believe that the Chinese state can and will take advantage of the incredible data gathering power of City Brain. According to Christopher Ashley Ford, Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation at the United States Department of State:</p><p>Firms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba, and Baidu have no meaningful ability to tell the Chinese Communist Party \"no\" if officials decide to ask for their assistance .... Such aid may not necessarily occur routinely, but it certainly can occur--and presumably will--whenever the Party considers this useful and cares to demand it. (150)</p><p>That the Chinese state will be able to use City Brain and similar technologies to help it monitor and control its citizens, therefore, is a virtual certainty. Yet, as City Brain spreads to cities across the globe, it is possible that the Chinese state will use its influence on Alibaba and other companies to gain an equal level of access in any and every city that implements Chinese smart city technology. This fear echoes and amplifies the existing concerns about the spread of Huawei's 5G technology, which are considered below. (151)</p><p>Further legitimate fears arise from concerns that as this technology spreads, City Brain-like systems might be built and controlled by purely private interests. In the words of John Wethington:</p><p>[I]t's not difficult to imagine the potential for abuse that would exist if a platform like this were brought to the U.S. with no civilian and governmental regulations or oversight... while businesses cannot simply plug in to FBI data sets today it would not be hard for them to access other state or local criminal databases and begin to create their own profiles on customers or adversaries. (152)</p><p>The potential for the private use and abuse of this data could be even greater in developing nations where governments would have less technical and regulatory ability or inclination to pushback against wealthy and powerful companies, most of which would be based in other countries.</p><p>B. Monitoring Muslims</p><p>China's Western provinces, especially Xinjiang, have long been areas discontented with PRC rule, which is both a cause and a result of repression against Muslim minorities. (153) The region has a long but troubled relationship with Beijing, with the Qing and subsequent Republican governments often only loosely controlling the region. (154) This culminated in a strong nationalist movement and even a brief period of independence in the 1930s and 1940s. (155) Since the rise of the PRC, however, Beijing has exerted increasingly tighter control over the region. (156) After 9/11, the PRC used the threat of Islamic terrorism to justify its repression, yet most of the discontent has surfaced in the form of ethnic riots, such as a major outbreak in the summer of 2009. (157)</p><p>The repression has stepped up since 2017, with at least 800,000 Muslims being detained in \"re-education\" camps. (158) In some ways, this is just a particularly extreme phase in ongoing cycles of repression. In 2010, for example, Beijing essentially turned off the internet in Xinjiang for ten months. (159) What makes this round of repression different and important for considering the future of smart cities is that the detentions and repression seem to be quietly supported by a sophisticated and massive effort to use data collection to target and sustain it.</p><p>In early 2018, Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international NGO, downloaded a smartphone application designed for use by Chinese officials in Xinjiang. The application is part of China's Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), an overarching system of mass surveillance in Xinjiang, and seems to have been created by a major Chinese military contractor. The goal of this effort seems to be an unprecedented level of surveillance and control of everyone in the province. Working with a Berlin-based security company to decipher and reverse engineer the application, HRW was able to assemble a picture of a remarkably data-intensive program of mass surveillance underway in Xinjiang. (160)</p><p>The IJOP, in large part, appears to be an effort to assemble every piece of information the government can learn about residents of Xinjiang, but what makes it so unprecedented is the overwhelming number of data sources the application can draw on. (161) Starting in 2017, authorities in Xinjiang began collecting biometrics, including DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the ages of 12 and 65. (162) Additional information collected includes height, religious dress, beard length, electricity and gas usage, package deliveries, use of a home's back versus the front door, movements around cities and the province, police records, addresses, vehicle registration, as well as details on trips abroad. (163)</p><p>The breadth of the data collected is even more staggering once the detail of the information becomes clear. Information on packages, for example, includes not only basic information on the sender, intended recipient, and delivery company but also includes who received the package upon delivery, the date and time, X-rays, and photos of it. (164) Information on gas and electricity usage is presumably drawn from utility companies and financial information from banks, both of which are partially--if not completely--state-owned. (165) Information on the sending and delivery of packages is added and must come, at least in part, from private delivery companies. Cameras equipped with facial recognition, cross-referenced with existing government biometric data, provide much of the most important information on a person's comings and goings. (166) Physical checkpoints have been set up all over Xinjiang to check IDs, often in conjunction with facial recognition. Additionally, these checkpoints seem to have been quietly equipped with \"data doors,\" special machines that detect and log the MAC addresses and 1MEI numbers of any phones that pass through the checkpoint. (167) Similarly, the IJOP application seems to pick up and log wireless signals and their security features (a process called \"wardriving\"). (168) While this level of data collection would certainly be ripe for a legal challenge elsewhere, even in China, it seems likely that the IJOP violates relatively limited restrictions on state surveillance. (169) Yet, mounting a legal or political challenge to the system would almost certainly be both dangerous and futile. While many actions of the local Chinese state can successfully and safely be challenged in court, (170) more politically sensitive cases, especially those relating to ethnic minorities, are beyond the pale. Taking such a case to court could lead to a wide variety of repressive responses from the state against both plaintiffs and their lawyers, including criminal prosecution. (171)</p><p>Once assembled, the information collected by the IJOP is used to identify \"suspicious\" individuals or situations. (172) Given the incredible breadth and depth of data available to it, the IJOP is surprisingly mechanistic in determining which individuals or situations are worthy of further scrutiny. (173) Instead of the big-data-worthy algorithms we might expect, the application seems to use \"simple conditional statements--if a, then b (for example, if the person who drives the car is not the same as the person to whom the car is registered, then investigate this person).\" (174) Having identified a person or situation for further review, the application then prompts low-level local officials to investigate. A pair of mock examples from HRW's reverse engineering of the application provides a sense of how the application is meant to function. The first example shows the extent to which investigations are prompted purely by when and where people are picked up by automated surveillance, such as facial recognition systems and data doors. This seems to work in combination with conclusions drawn from algorithms that glean characteristics like ethnicity and religiosity based on personal appearance: \"suspicious person Zhang San, whose address is Xinjiang Urumqi, ID number 653222198502043265, phone number 18965983265. That person has repeatedly appeared in inappropriate locations, and he displays [or his clothing shows] strong religiousness.\" A second example shows how the application prompts officials to collect more data: \"Suspicious person Maimaiti Muhemuti, who originally lives in Xinjiang's Urumqi, ID number 653222198502043215, phone number 13803021458. Report time: 2017-09-25 14:01:53 [Mission] text: Please carefully investigate whether he still lives in Urumqi and investigate his family situation.\" (175) While this overall program of mass surveillance is overseen by the Public Security Bureau (the local police), personnel from other government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and public institutions have also been used to surveil people. (176) Surveillance may also include extended home visits, (177) which in 2017 amounted to an attempt to put one million government officials in the homes of Xinjiang residents. (178)</p><p>Visits by the prompted officials are meant to produce yet more information, which seems to be the main purpose of the IJOP application. (179) Officials are urged to add varied information to the IJOP through the application, from text and drop-down menus to audio and photos. (180) The investigation can also include \"a phone search for software, network tools, or content that is problematic.\" (181) Fifty-one network tools are flagged as suspicious, including tools for circumventing online censorship, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and apps that allow for encrypted communication, like WhatsApp and Viber. (182) The surveillance does not end with the targeted minorities.</p><p>The app also scores government officials on their performance in fulfilling tasks and is a tool for higher-level supervisors to assign tasks to, and keep tabs on the performance of, lower-level officials. The IJOP application, in part, aims to control government officials to ensure that they are efficiently carrying out the government's repressive orders. (183)</p><p>While IJOP is likely to stay limited to Xinjiang or perhaps other minority-heavy areas of China, for the time being, the authoritarian possibilities its example hints at are terrifyingly Orwellian.</p><p>C. Social Credit System</p><p>Although it is currently only peripherally related to core smart city functions and extensively covered in both popular and academic publications, no discussion about data security in the PRC could be complete without a brief mention of China's rapidly expanding social credit systems (SCS). The \"Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System,\" released in 2014 by the State Council (the PRC's chief administrative authority), provides an authoritative direction on what the PRC seeks to accomplish with SCS. (184)</p><p>[The plan] focused on the creation of the underlying information infrastructure that would be required for the system's successful rollout. It systematically provided for standardized means to record credit-related information in different sections of the administration, databases to store this information at the central and local levels, the establishment of credit reporting mechanisms to enable public access to the information, as well as information sharing processes in order to counter the siloing of data within the bureaucracy. (185)</p><p>This data is then used to implement a system of rewards and punishments implemented with implications for interactions with both the state and the market. Black (bad) and red (good) lists would be created to punish and reward people. (186) Being on the blacklist could result in serious consequences for an individual, and even their family who might find themselves \"unable to purchase high-speed train tickets, fly on an airplane, or send [their] kids to a private school.\" (187) Despite assertions to the contrary, especially in the popular press, what does not seem to be present in the creation of the SCS are the types of big data algorithmic analyses that are at work in the City Brain project. (188) Essentially, the SCS appears to be a far broader and more authoritarian use of the types of credit rating systems that are already common in wealthy democracies. (189) Aside from substantial data collection, therefore, the applicability and comparability of the SCS to smart cities are relatively small.</p><p>The evidence suggests that rather than finding SCSs to be a dystopian violation of personal privacy as they are invariably conceived of in Western media, they are extremely popular among average Chinese. Evidence from a 2018 cross-regional online survey by Genia Kosta of the Freie Universitat Berlin found remarkably high levels of support for social credit systems. While 48.9% of respondents said they strongly approved of the schemes and 31.1% said they somewhat approved, less than 1.5% said they disapproved of such schemes. Older, male, higher-income, more educated, and urban respondents showed higher levels of support. (190) These findings may seem surprising, but supplementary \"interviews show that citizens perceive SCSs not as an instrument of surveillance, but as an instrument to improve the quality of life and to close institutional and regulatory gaps, leading to more honest and law-abiding behavior in society.\" (191)</p><p>The difference between public perception of the SCS in China and its depiction in the Western media can largely be explained by the remarkably high levels of trust that Chinese people have in their state. According to Edelman, the world's biggest public relations firm by revenue, the Chinese have the highest level of trust in their government of the 26 countries they surveyed, with a score of 86 out of 100. (192) Other empirical work has long shown high levels of trust and support for the Chinese state. (193) This explanation is borne out by other findings of the survey; 77% of respondents expected the central government to be the most responsible user of personal data. Provincial (48%) and municipal governments (42%) were also seen as relatively trustworthy, and even state-owned companies (27%) were viewed as far more trustworthy than private companies (8%). (194) The conclusion, yet again, seems to be that, to date, average Chinese are comparatively comfortable with the collection, analysis, and use of data, especially when controlled by the state.</p><p>D. Other Applications of Facial Recognition Technology</p><p>While the other applications of smart city-related technology explored in this Section are large-scale projects, a few smaller examples of uses of facial recognition technology in China help us understand how far down the path to ubiquity important surveillance technology has traveled. The examples also give color to how unconcerned the state and even private companies are with uses of technology that many citizens of democracies might see as Orwellian.</p><p>China has slowly been rolling out new anti-jaywalking systems that use cameras, LED screens, and facial recognition to identify, fine, and shame jaywalkers. At very busy intersections, cameras on traffic lights take pictures of jaywalkers, use facial-recognition software to identify them, and subsequently issue them fines as well as post their pictures and identifying details on screens mounted on the traffic lights. (195) The technology amusingly misfired when it named a well-known Chinese businesswoman, Dong Mingzhu, as a jaywalker after recognizing her photograph from an advertisement on the side of a bus. (196) Furthermore, in a pilot program at a public toilet in Beijing, facial recognition is used to combat toilet paper thieves by dispensing only two feet of toilet paper to any given person within nine minutes. (197)</p><p>Chinese have little choice but to consent to systems like the anti-jaywalking traffic lights, though they could attempt to disguise their faces when they cross. Yet, even when given a choice, the average Chinese seem relatively willing to \"opt-in\" to facial recognition even when the payoff seems vanishingly low. In some Chinese airports, terminals offer the minor convenience of allowing travelers to check their flight details by presenting their face to a camera equipped with facial recognition software. (198) Some of KFC's 6000 outlets in China (199) have even experimented with facial recognition systems for ordering food, and though the idea does not seem to have taken off, it also did not seem to spark any serious resistance. (200) Facial recognition-based payment systems, however, are quickly gaining popularity. In Henan's capital of Zhengzhou, nearly 200,000 commuters opted to authorize facial recognition-based payments to use the local subway. (201)</p><p>There does seem to be a limit, however, on the uses of facial recognition that average Chinese citizens, or at least netizens, will tolerate. For example, in January 2020,</p><p>the urban management department of Suzhou, a city of six million people in Anhui Province, sparked outrage online when it published surveillance photos taken by street cameras of seven residents wearing pajamas in public along with parts of their names, government identification numbers and the locations where their \"uncivilized behavior\" had taken place. (202)</p><p>While the government's battle against public pajamas and other \"uncivilized behavior\" has been an ongoing issue for over a decade in China, this use of facial recognition quickly attracted national criticism and caused Suzhou officials to apologize.</p><p>E. Lessons from the Chinese Case</p><p>While the technologies and applications assessed in these cases are very different, each of them is essentially about the collection and use of data that, at least in theory, can be applied to smart cities. It should be immediately evident that many of these examples fall afoul of Edwards' key security issues. (203) None of the systems explored above, with perhaps the minor exception of the airport facial recognition system, provide any meaningful opportunity for opting out or providing consent. All these systems, but especially City Brain and the IJOP, create privately-held data linked specifically to individuals from \"public\" interactions that are as simple as walking down the street, making it very different than London's CTV security footage. All the systems seem to involve private contractors who may have access to the data, though admittedly a lack of information and transparency makes this issue difficult to assess fully. Much of the data fed into these systems, especially City Brain, is repurposed from the Internet of Things. (204) Finally, as was vividly demonstrated by Wethington, once collected data is stored on the cloud, little thought is given to its security.</p><p>Beyond these clear failures to solve or even engage with privacy challenges, there are common themes that emerge from China's projects, which help inform our comparison with wealthy democracies. First, there is little concern on almost any level about what data is collected, how it is stored, for how long, and who has access to it. Second, while wealthy democracies wring their hands about privacy and other issues, (205) China and its private sector are powering ahead and at a staggering rate. Third, there is little transparency about how any of these projects or technologies are advancing; this is unsurprising given that there seems to be relatively little demand for transparency from political or legal systems or even public opinion. Fourth, the amount of data being collected and used in these projects is staggering. With the vital exception of City Brain, however, there seems to be a lack of the big data analytical techniques and sophisticated algorithms of the kind we might expect and indeed has sometimes been (mis)reported. It is possible that this more sophisticated analysis is coming, perhaps as part of the expansion of City Brain. But it is also possible that given the level of data available and the applicable goals, more sophisticated analysis is simply unnecessary. Google, Facebook, and Amazon may need cutting edge data analytics to help fill in the blanks about user age, gender, religion, marital and family status, and other attributes. Still, the Chinese State will already know any one of these data points as a certainty. Lastly, average Chinese, with the notable exception of targeted minority groups, are generally willing to accept obviously authoritarian uses of the PRC's rapidly increasing data collection. Chinese appear to overwhelmingly support a social credit system that is universally disparaged abroad. (206) They are apparently willing to accept facial recognition even for the minor convenience of paying subway fare or getting their flight information. This may seem surprising in the West, and yet it makes sense given the high level of trust most citizens have in the Chinese state. Given, however, that this trust is largely built on the state's record of overseeing the largest and most dramatic spurt of development in human history (performance legitimacy) (207) and that trust in government usually suffers during a downturn (performance theory), (208) it is likely that trust in the state would suffer from a serious economic downturn. While the details of how and when this might happen are unclear, the possibility concerns the Chinese state and may be one of the reasons for its ramping up of surveillance and other repressive capacities.</p><p>Before indulging in dystopian speculation about the depth and power of China's digital authoritarianism, it is important to have some reasonable perspective. On a trip to Shanghai in May 2019, one of this Article's authors could not help but notice that people paid little attention to face recognition-equipped traffic lights. Instead, a much more obvious conflict was going on between Shanghai's police and residents being ticketed for unregistered electric scooters or riding bicycles on the sidewalk. These conflicts could be seen played out all over Shanghai, but always in person and often with long, drawn-out arguments between the public security officers and people being fined. (209) What is more, the e-scooter crackdown seems to extend only to a handful of China's largest cities. (210) Within smaller, less-developed cities, these types of violations still generally go almost completely unnoticed. The PRC's dreams of complete surveillance and control are vast, (211) and the progress is rapid, but in many areas, state capacity and the monitoring and control of society still lags what is common in wealthy democracies. (212) In the contemporary PRC, policing society still happens face to face.</p><p>III. DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVES TO THE CHINA MODEL</p><p>In this Article, we argue that China's rapid advancement in smart cities technology should be a wakeup call to democracies. But the fact that it has forged ahead so quickly also means that the China Model offers vivid examples that other democracies can learn from--although in most cases, China provides an example that democracies should avoid, rather than follow. This Part contrasts the Chinese example with the development of smart city technology in wealthy democracies. In particular, we examine the potential role of surveillance intermediaries and consider the role of Europe's data privacy law and potential U.S. parallels. Further, we evaluate if and how wealthy democracies can compete with Chinese smart city technology. Finally, we consider what China's rapid advancement in smart cities and democracies' lagging response means in the rest of the world.</p><p>China's smart city technologies offer almost no transparency or consent in terms of the collection, use, or storage of data. Additionally, when asked, private companies will not resist the state. (213) Samantha Hoffman, a visiting academic fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, explained that \"Under [China's] Cyber Security Law, the personal data a company collects can be protected from misuse by the company ... that same data, however, is not protected from the government. This isn't contradictory in Chinese law, even if it is according to Western norms.\" (214) In short, China can serve as a vivid demonstration of a system in which the state and private companies fail to check one another in the collection and use of data.</p><p>Another serious issue in China is the lack of choice between companies that may collect personal information. In no small part, this is due to a close collaboration between the private sector and the state. Private companies like Huawei and Alibaba maintain and value close relationships with the state; other technology companies, including all cellular network providers, are state-owned. Additionally, foreign competitors that might offer a more privacy-friendly alternative are censored or banned from certain sectors. (215)</p><p>Democracies advancing smart cities technology should ensure they give their citizens more choice. Many applications of smart cities technology make use of public data in some way. That said, it is difficult for even a relatively educated and wealthy consumer who cares a great deal about data privacy to move away from a jurisdiction with weak privacy protections to one that takes data security more seriously. By contrast, shifting between providers of other types of products involved in collecting and using smart cities data could be much easier. In many cases, consumers can shift between ride-hailing apps, smartphone makers, internet providers, and other service providers in a few minutes and at no cost. One lesson for smart city designers, therefore, could be to ensure that consumers and residents are provided as much choice as possible when using private or third-party products to interact with smart city infrastructure.</p><p>A. Surveillance Intermediaries</p><p>Because of the high technological bar and investment needed for large scale smart cities projects, it is probable that nearly all will involve private partners. As we have seen in the Chinese case, this can create potential problems and an added layer of complexity when trying to protect privacy. Yet, we argue it could also create opportunities for helping to protect data and privacy better and limit the abuse of smart cities technology.</p><p>Tech companies in wealthy democracies could play a vital role in protecting personal data from the state. In part, this could and should be a result of legal restrictions that prevent companies from collecting, keeping, or sharing certain kinds of data. But market incentives can also induce companies to take privacy more seriously. Companies can create significant value for their brands by cultivating a reputation for keeping its customers' data secure. While most consumers are probably more worried about malicious actors, evidence that a company can and will protect data from the state can be important to many, from small-government conservatives in the United States to citizens of developing countries with worrisome records on civil liberties. Imagine if customers in Russia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, or Iran had a choice between Chinese technology they could be relatively sure would allow the state access to their data, and a company based in a democracy with strict data privacy protection, which consumers could be relatively sure would do its best to pushback against state snooping. This possibility is not theoretical: in repeatedly and very publicly refusing to unlock iPhones for the American federal government, Apple has proven both the strength of its encryption and the depth of its commitment to privacy protection. The volume, and more importantly, the nature of the publicity that this incident generated for Apple could not be bought at any price. (216)</p><p>Current U.S. law and the policies of big tech firms seriously limit the extent to which technology firms can push back against government requests for data. The third-party doctrine, as applied in United States v. Miller (217) and Smith v. Maryland, (218) holds that voluntarily providing information to a third party forfeits any privacy interest in that information. (219) The inability of private companies to push back against U.S. law enforcement is evidenced by the remarkable quantity of data major technology companies provide to the government. By 2019, \"Facebook said it produced data for 88% of U.S. government requests, and that a majority of them, 47,457, were under the 'legal process' category that includes search warrants, subpoenas and court orders.\" (220) These requests extend to a large number of technology companies and have been rising dramatically. (221)</p><p>Existing jurisprudence also helps point towards possible legal solutions to how to protect personal data better. For example, United States v. Jones raised the possibility of a constitutional difference between short- and long-term surveillance. (222) In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:</p><p>Under this approach, relatively short-term monitoring of a person's movements on public streets accords with expectations of privacy that our society has recognized as reasonable. But the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. (223)</p><p>Justice Sotomayor's separate concurring opinion picked up on similar themes. (224) Years later, the implications of IoT enabled surveillance and just how far long term and even retroactive surveillance could be taken were addressed in Carpenter v. United States. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts opined:</p><p>With access to CSLI [cell site location information], the Government can now travel back in time to retrace a person's whereabouts, subject only to the retention polices [sic] of the wireless carriers, which currently maintain records for up to five years. Critically, because location information is continually logged for all of the 400 million devices in the United States--not just those belonging to persons who might happen to come under investigation--this newfound tracking capacity runs against everyone. Unlike with the GPS device in Jones, police need not even know in advance whether they want to follow a particular individual, or when. Whoever the suspect turns out to be, he has effectively been tailed every moment of every day for five years, and the police may--in the Government's view--call upon the results of that surveillance without regard to the constraints of the Fourth Amendment. Only the few without cell phones could escape this tireless and absolute surveillance. (225)</p><p>Companies can and should create more streamlined systems that collect less data, anonymize it, or delete it more quickly. Currently, American mobile providers store customers' location data collected for between one year (Verizon) and seven years (AT&amp;T). (226) There seems little justification for keeping this data, especially un-anonymized, other than selling it to third parties, which has come under congressional and popular scrutiny. (227) Strong legal restrictions on both selling data and keeping it for extended periods would help companies resist state demands for data. Companies cannot be made to produce data they never collected, no longer have, or cannot link to specific individuals.</p><p>Building on the logic established in Jones and Carpenter, the United States could structure its data privacy around a short- versus long-term distinction. Personal data could be used to optimize traffic, emergency response routes, public transit, and a wide variety of other city services, but could be legally required to be deleted within hours or even minutes.</p><p>If the United States is to become an exemplar of data privacy to be emulated and to disperse high standards along with its smart cities technology globally, it will need newer, smarter, and tougher laws. In this regard, the European Union is already far ahead of the United States. In the next Section, we examine a case that shows how Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can and has empowered surveillance intermediaries to push back against the local state. We will also show how California's new privacy law is bringing the United States into line with these same standards.</p><p>B. Europe</p><p>Thanks to the GDPR, the European Union, composed of nearly 30 sovereign nations, can be seen as having a more comprehensive, coherent, and consistent privacy policy than the United States. (228) There are several reasons for this. In part, it is the result of the strong federal nature of the United States, which has also hurt advancements in other areas of innovation that generally benefit from strong government support. For example, policy fragmentation and lack of clear national leadership were two of the reasons that the United States was surpassed by the PRC and the European Union in the development of renewable energy, where a \"patchwork of state-level approaches creates complexity, instills uncertainty, and inhibits opportunities to optimize resource allocation.\" (229)</p><p>Yet the U.S. federal structure also offers opportunities for specific jurisdictions, especially populous ones, to lead the way by setting higher standards than the federal government or other states. Sometimes this is merely states fulfilling their roles as \"laboratories of democracy.\" (230) When a state or city sets a higher minimum wage, it provides an example that other states or the federal government may or may not choose to emulate. (231) But when a particularly populous state sets strict standards that certain products must meet, companies often choose to meet this higher standard with products offered throughout the United States or even the world. For example, California's emissions and fuel standards for automobiles are \"benchmarks set in the Golden State [that] ripple through the rest of the country and can even shape the global market.\" (232) For this reason, the best hope for near-term improvements in privacy regulations in the United States comes in the form of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the strictest privacy law in the United States, which came into effect in January 2020. (233) The CCPA will have a nation-wide, and to a lesser extent, global impact not only because of California's large population and lucrative markets but because over half of the United States' and over a quarter of the world's 20 largest tech companies are headquartered in California. (234)</p><p>The CCPA will set the de facto national standard for privacy for the foreseeable future. It will, therefore, begin to bring the United States into line with the privacy principles enshrined in Europe's GDPR. More specifically, those principals are lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality (security); and accountability. (235) Taken together as the standard for Europe and the de facto standard for the United States, the GDPR and CCPA could give companies in wealthy democracies a relatively clear global standard. When combined, the United States and the European Union represent a market of around 800 million people and a GDP that is still far larger than the PRC's. This could give companies developing smart cities technologies in wealthy democracies a market big enough for them to compete with Chinese companies. Additionally, Chinese companies will need to meet these same standards, at least in the United States and European Union, lest they forgo many of the world's largest markets. In order to capitalize on these opportunities, efforts should be taken to harmonize the privacy regimes among democracies as much as possible.</p><p>While the impact of the CCPA is still uncertain, the GDPR, which has applied since May 25, 2018, has already had a substantial impact. (236) The idea that private service providers might push back against government overreach with smart cities data might initially seem optimistic, yet this is exactly what the GDPR has helped some surveillance intermediaries to do. Br0ndby IF, a football club based in the outskirts of Copenhagen, uses facial recognition software to prevent known troublemakers from attending matches in the team's stadium. (237) Br0ndby's system marks one of the first private large-scale uses of facial recognition software after the GDPR came into effect. (238) In compliance with the GDPR, the facial recognition system is used to enter those from the watchlist into the system only on game day and is deleted at the end of the day. The system is kept separate from the internet, and a cross-check is used to avoid false positives. (239)</p><p>The value of strict data privacy laws being passed and enforced on private systems and the contrast with the Chinese case examined above should be clear. Less clear is the extent to which such laws could and should enable private companies to push back against possible overreach from other parts of the state. Mickel Lauritsen, Br0ndby's security chief, says that local police have asked him to use the team's facial recognition system to assist in an investigation, but that he was obligated to refuse by the terms of their regulatory permission. (240) There are signs that these clear rules, when strictly enforced, facilitate public trust. In the words of one football fan, \"You can't do anything in Denmark without getting the proper approval. So it's not being misused, I don't think. You can't do that in Denmark.\" (241)</p><p>An arrangement like the strict European approach to privacy, however, may be difficult or impossible to replicate in the United States. For one thing, it is relatively easy for Europe to be strict or even punitive against technology companies in both legislation and enforcement because none of the world's largest tech companies are based in Europe. Yet the CCPA should provide some hope here as well: if California can move to reign in its large tech firms like Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook, perhaps the rest of the country will be willing to follow. Nevertheless, even if the legislation and tough enforcement prove forthcoming, it is not clear that public opinion will follow. China and most governments in Europe, especially Northern Europe, have long enjoyed higher levels of trust among their people. (242) This is unlikely to be easy or fast to reproduce in the U.S. context and is another reason that more market-based solutions to data privacy issues might be a more practical choice in the United States.</p><p>C. Can Democracies Compete with the PRC's Smart City Technology?</p><p>In this Article, we argue that wealthy democracies must push forward with the development of smart cities for two reasons. First, smart cities can provide meaningful benefits not only to the residents of wealthy democracies, such as in improving traffic but also to the world, like combatting climate change. Second, if wealthy democracies and their corporations do not offer the world smart cities technologies that allow for some measure of privacy, democracy, and personal freedom, then non-democratic countries and their corporations will offer them smart cities technologies that do less to address these concerns.</p><p>The idea that China could beat out wealthy democracies in smart cities technology has a strong precedent. The most relevant example is the current state of and debates about 5G technology and its deployment around the globe. (243) Beginning wide-scale deployment in 2019, 5G is a fifth-generation wireless technology that offers much faster data on digital cellular networks. Huawei, a Chinese company with close links to the Chinese state, is the world leader in 5G technology. The United States has repeatedly voiced security concerns about Huawei's close relationship to the Chinese state and that using their technology could give Beijing unprecedented access to, and even control over, other countries' communication technology. In the words of a report published by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence:</p><p>Chinese companies are not only subsidised by the Chinese government but also legally compelled to work with its intelligence services. Whether the risk of such collaboration is real or perceived, the fear remains that adopting 5G technology from Huawei would introduce a reliance on equipment which can be controlled by the Chinese intelligence services and the military in both peacetime and crisis. (244)</p><p>There are alternatives to Huawei's technology available from companies, such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung, that are based in liberal democracies. (245) Yet, Huawei advertises its technology as not only cheaper to purchase, but lighter, easier, faster, and cheaper to install, cheaper to maintain, and more energy-efficient. (246) Because of these advantages and despite the warnings from the United States and NATO, some of the wealthiest nations in the world, including Switzerland and Saudi Arabia, are opting for Huawei's technology. (247) The calculus for poorer developing nations is likely to be even simpler and inevitable. (248) A massive and rapid change will need to occur if Huawei is not to dominate the world's cellular networks in the near future.</p><p>In no small part, Huawei's success in 5G technology is the result of strong support from the Chinese state.</p><p>A Wall Street Journal review of Huawei's grants, credit facilities, tax breaks and other forms of financial assistance details for the first time how Huawei had access to as much as $75 billion in state support as it grew from a little-known vendor of phone switches to the world's largest telecom-equipment company--helping Huawei offer generous financing terms and undercut rivals' prices by some 30%, analysts and customers say. (249)</p><p>As security concerns related to the rollout of Huawei-powered 5G networks grow, the United States is finally reacting. In January 2020, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation that would provide over $1 billion for the development of 5G alternatives to Huawei. (250) Yet, with funding a fraction the size of what Huawei received, and 5G technology already being implemented, the initiative seems like far too little, far too late. Just as 5G technology gives insight into potential Chinese dominance of smart cities, it echoes China's success in previous races for technology, especially renewable energy. (251)</p><p>What makes these examples truly worrying from the perspective of smart cities is that China beat wealthy democracies in the development of technologies such as 5G and solar panels, even though these technologies are not subject to nearly the same level of concern, complexity, and negative public onion as many smart cities technologies.</p><p>D. Battlegrounds for the Meaning of Smart Cities?</p><p>City Brain is already being implemented in Malaysia's most populous metropolis. (252) This points to Southeast Asia as the probable location of the first battleground in the contest of smart city technology between the PRC and democracies. Geographically, the countries of Southeast Asia are relatively close to China. Most have large ethnic Chinese communities that have traditionally worked in business and may maintain business ties to China. (253) Southeast Asian countries also have relatively similar levels of development to China, (254) and relatively positive attitudes towards the PRC, at least compared to other Asian countries like India, Japan, and South Korea. (255) They also have generally more authoritarian and less democratic tendencies. (256) These last two factors could be important for minimizing public opinion pushback against projects that could give not only their countries' leaders but Chinese companies and even the Chinese state, the key to ubiquitous surveillance of their cities.</p><p>Southeast Asia is not unique, however, in their increasingly overflowing and traffic-clogged cities, which are badly in need of improved infrastructure and services. (257) Even if Chinese tech companies do not find Southeast Asia to be fertile ground for their smart cities technology, as Alibaba seems to hope, other regions like the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and even Latin America all offer likely opportunities because they suffer from many of the same problems arising from rapid urbanization. (258)</p><p>None of this is to suggest, however, that people, companies, or governments in developing countries outside China lack agency. A country like India with a huge population and an already impressive technology sector could still emerge as to equal or even outmatch the smart city technology developed in China and wealthy democracies.</p><p>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD</p><p>While we recognize that smart city efforts like Quayside face serious and unanswered questions about data and digital infrastructure, we argue three major reasons why democracies must continue to develop smart cities technology with all deliberate speed. First, many of the questions about data privacy and digital infrastructure can only be answered through real working examples of smart cities technology. Some projects may fail to produce results. Others may end up being viewed as not responsive enough to terms and concerns related to data protection. Yet, if there is any lesson to be drawn from the experiences of the digital revolution, it is that both experiences of failure and the creation of successful models are necessary for smart cities to continue to advance. Smart cities developers may have to \"move fast and break things\" (Facebook's motto until 2014), (259) especially if they are to catch up with their Chinese competitors.</p><p>Second, smart cities projects have the potential to be important parts of the solution to pressing global issues such as climate change and inequality. Many of the technologies with the most potential to address these problems are the least objectionable. Smart cities should not be only about the shiniest technology and fastest processors. Instead, they should take data seriously and focus on those technologies that offer the most advantage the most efficiently --even if that is something as simple as wood construction.</p><p>Third, if democracies do not develop and regulate their own smart cities technology, the spread of PRC-based technology will go largely unchallenged. Democracies should not let the great be the enemy of the good. Some compromises and sacrifices of data privacy may be necessary to strike a balance and move smart cities technologies forward before China gains an advantage in smart cities that is insurmountable. Temporary concessions to Google over a project like Quayside could be rolled back relatively easily by democratic governments. Cities-worth of cameras feeding into Alibaba's servers will, conversely, be far harder to undo.</p><p>Finally, we offer two major recommendations that we believe could help in the development of smart cities in the democratic world. First, massive government investment in smart cities to help counter the tremendous sums that the PRC has already poured into their smart cities' efforts. This must be done before it is too late, as demonstrated by the example of 5G or solar technology. Second, clear and transparent laws protecting users and residents must be implemented and enforced. Violations need to be announced and punished transparently and publicly. These laws also need to empower private companies to refuse government requests for data. The laws should be harmonized within countries and even across as many democracies as possible. Only this will provide a more or less unified market that is bigger than China's market.</p><p>In reality, it may be too late for some technologies and projects to catch up with City Brain in the near term. Every wasted opportunity, however, moves farther away from the prospect of cities that are not only smart but also transparent and respectful of individuals' data.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>This Article generally assumes that smart cities technology is coming, whether academics, governments, lawyers, judges, or citizens like it or not. Even if companies in wealthy democracies do not develop or implement certain types of technology for legal, political, commercial, or ethical reasons, companies in other countries, like the PRC, will happily sell and implement their smart city technologies. Indeed, Section II.A discussed how this is already happening.</p><p>This Article considers how contrasting approaches to smart cities has and will impact smart city development, and how the technologies will be adopted outside of the PRC and wealthy democracies. It is imperative for established democracies, and the companies based in them, to continue to move forward with smart cities technology development and implementation. Further, they should use smart city technology with the most rigorous standards of transparency and oversight possible. Because smart city technology will continue to spread, particularly to the developing world where the will and ability to guard against its abuse is lower, wealthy democracies must push forward with the development of smart cities, both to create technology with better built-in safeguards and to develop and normalize rolling best practices for data privacy.</p><p>John Wagner Givens (*) &amp; Debra Lam (*)</p><p>(*) Associate Professor, School of Government and International Affairs, Kennesaw State University.

However, the recent launch of Amazon Echo Frames and Google's purchase of smart glasses maker North in June 2020 suggests Big Tech still sees potential in the technology as a consumer product. Meanwhile, smart glasses have also begun to carve out a niche as a business tool.    There is little to choose between the consumer and enterprise smart glasses segments when it comes to volume of shipments, but the enterprise market generates far greater revenue, equivalent to 80% of the total market in 2019. Enterprise devices cost significantly more than their consumer counterparts, as they typically feature industry-specific capabilities.   Scope   This report provides an overview of the smart glasses theme. It identifies the key trends impacting growth of the theme over the next 12 to 24 months, split into three categories: technology trends, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory trends. It includes a comprehensive industry analysis, including up-to-date forecasts for global smart glasses revenues and shipments to 2030. The detailed value chain shows where smart glasses fit into the broader Internet of Things ecosystem.  Reasons to Buy   With wide-ranging applications, from music streaming to industrial operations, smart glasses have the potential to drive a major change in the way we interact with the world, but the technology is in the early stages of development. This report tells you everything you need to know about smart glasses, identifies the leading vendors (as well as those that are lagging behind), and includes new forecasts showing the impact of COVID-19 on sales of these devices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42996355162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RY-2YG1-F07F-801X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright -

BONASIA</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cisco Systems' gear powers much of the Internet, but the company last month made a move to also play a central role in a market it says might be 100 times bigger -- smart grids.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cisco's not alone. The building of smart grids will be a multitrillion-dollar opportunity for tech companies, industry observers say. The first billions are already starting, thanks in part to the federal stimulus package.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Smart grids combine networked sensors with software to run systems for electricity, transportation, fuel and water.</p><p>Inexpensive sensors transmit data over computer networks to do such tasks as reduce energy usage and better move traffic along busy streets.</p><p>U.S. utilities alone will spend $1.5 trillion upgrading infrastructure by 2030, says a recent study by research firm the Brattle Group.</p><p>Sensors To Permeate Our Lives</p><p>Today's powerful, low-cost computer chips and high-speed networks make smart grids feasible. The grid concept is often described as \"the Internet of things,\" said Sam Lucero, an ABI Research analyst.</p><p>\"Sensors are going into more and more devices that will permeate our lives,\" Lucero said. \"In the next 15 to 20 years, sensors will permeate our infrastructure and monitor the physical environment.\"</p><p>The federal stimulus package includes tens of billions of dollars to upgrade aging infrastructure. At least $4.5 billion is allocated to build smart electric grids and install smart power meters, ABI says. Smart meters monitor how much energy a house or commercial building is using in real time, helping utilities regulate power generation.</p><p>Smart meter sales in North America will jump 85% this year, though to a mere $17 million, says ABI. But that's just the start.</p><p>Besides Cisco, other big tech companies investing heavily in smart grids include IBM and Intel.</p><p>IBM has branded the concept \"Smarter Planet.\" It's designed smart grids for utilities, railroads and transportation systems. Big Blue provides hardware, software and expertise to build grids.</p><p>\"There's a lot of buzz in the marketplace,\" said Steve Mills, a senior vice president who heads IBM's software group.</p><p>\"That's a reflection of more businesses seeing the benefits of these technologies to realize a much more efficient infrastructure,\" he said.</p><p>Smart grids should, for example, let utilities both cut pollution and save money. Smart meters will track how much electricity is being used at households and use that data to make sure power stations, including wind farms and solar installations, are working at peak efficiency.</p><p>They'll also use sensors on the grid to immediately detect, and often fix, any problems.</p><p>The network gear market for utility smart grids alone should reach $20 billion per year by 2014, says Judy Lin, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco's ethernet switching technology group.</p><p>Cisco, GE Team Up In Miami</p><p>\"We feel our role is to be that communications provider because of our experience with the Internet and voice networks, and our focus on energy management,\" she said.</p><p>On May 18, Cisco released a new platform designed to provide utility customers with all the hardware, software and services they need to build and run smart grids. In April, Cisco partnered with General Electric and Florida Power &amp; Light to build a smart grid pilot for the city of Miami. The project aims to give consumers more choice in how they consume and conserve energy, Lin says.</p><p>\"Both commercial and residential energy management can benefit from smart energy grids,\" she said.</p><p>For its smart grid programs, IBM strives to make the networks \"more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent,\" Allan Schurr, vice president of strategy and development for IBM's global energy and utilities business, told IBD.</p><p>In February, he testified before the U.S. House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.</p><p>Smart utility grids can slash energy costs, increase efficiency and improve the quality of electrical service, Schurr told Congress. In addition, smart grids give consumers more say about their usage patterns.</p><p>Consumers Can Take Charge</p><p>For instance, he says, utilities should give users a break for running their appliances during off-peak hours.</p><p>\"The greater availability of sensors means consumers can be more active participants,\" Schurr told IBD. \"Consumers want to manage their energy consumption, from their pool pumps to air conditioners.\"</p><p>Another focus involves smart grids for transportation. Railways, city streets and highways are increasingly plagued by traffic jams and pollution.</p><p>IBM has launched projects in China, Taiwan and the Netherlands designed to provide smart railway grids, or systems that more efficiently run the rails.</p><p>Demand for urban transportation is rising much faster than the potential supply, says Naveen Lamba, intelligent transportation lead for IBM Global Business Services.</p><p>\"Congestion is a big driver for smart grids, because this problem is going from bad to worse very rapidly in many developing countries and in the developed world,\" he said.</p><p>For example, Stockholm has implemented IBM smart grids to charge usage fees for daytime auto traffic in downtown centers.</p><p>Sensors on cars and affixed to trellises built over streets automatically track when cars are using downtown roads at peak times, and drivers are automatically assessed fees that vary by the time of day.</p><p>Smart grids hold similar potential to manage oil pipelines, water systems and telecom networks.</p><p>Trillions, Not Billions</p><p>Some observers describe a \"pervasive Internet\" in which machines of the future will continually talk to each other, says Jonathan Berman, an analyst with Harbor Research.</p><p>\"This involves taking as many devices and objects as possible and connecting them all to the Internet,\" Berman said. \"While there are billions of people, there are trillions of devices.\"</p><p>Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, is pushing to create technical standards for smart grids.</p><p>Intel foresees microprocessors embedded into wind turbines and solar arrays, to provide real-time monitoring.</p><p>A host of other big tech vendors also are angling for a piece of the smart grid market. They include Oracle, EMC, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Google.</p><p>Smart grids also are a nice fit for industrial giants such as General Electric's GE Energy and metering firms such as Johnson Controls and Schlumberger.</p><p>Other big grid players include Hitachi, Siemens and Eaton. Energy service companies, utilities and telecom carriers are getting active as well.</p><p>\"We're dealing with limited resources for water, transportation and electricity,\" Lamba said. \"Smart grids provide a way to minimize the growing gap between supply and demand.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-6693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VVM-84X0-Y9NN-517V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

But presidents in modern times \"receive hundreds of gifts each year and no one particularly cares,\" meaning that  foreign emoluments are, like much of our written constitution, a dead letter.  Even if it weren't, given that an   emolument  is  any perquisite, advantage, profit, or gain arising from the possession of an office, \" for the law to apply in this case the profits Trump gains from the hotels would have to come from the fact that he's in office, and not the fact that he owned a chain of luxury resorts prior to assuming the presidency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Cox,</emphasis> writing for <url normalizedValue=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-is-helping-drive-liberals-away-from-religion/\"> FiveThirtyEight </url></p><p>The number of religiously unaffiliated Americans has steadily increased over the years, and the culprit might be might be the politicization of the pulpit. According to a recent study,  the Christian right s involvement with politics was prompting some left-leaning Americans to walk away from religion  in large numbers during the last 30 years. Today,  nearly one in four Americans are religiously unaffiliated,  and that number with self-identified liberals has grown to nearly 40 percent since 1990, which means  most people s political ideology is more tightly tethered to their religious identity.  Something as simple as seeing a Republican politician speaking in a church  could actually prompt some Democrats to say they were nonreligious. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Stewart</emphasis>, writing for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/18/20870938/break-up-big-tech-google-facebook-amazon-poll\"> Vox </url></p><p>More than two-thirds of Americans support breaking up tech firms, a proposal that unites partisans on both sides of the aisle, according to polling from Data For Progress.

It can lead you into a \u2018cognitive cloud\u2019 which destroys your powers of discretion.\u201d<br/><br/>The risks of advanced technology were raised by many of the participants in a session devoted to smart cities, innovation and technology. Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Program, said that technology and innovation were making governments better because they enabled citizens to participate more in decision-making.<br/><br/>But he warned against the concentration of power in a few private technology companies: \u201cIt is not a desirable outcome for ten companies to control all the data.\u201d<br/><br/>That was echoed by Francis Fukyama, futurist academic and best-selling author, in a separate session entitled \u201cThe future of global governance and net states.\u201d<br/><br/>He said: \u201cThe five big tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon \u2014 are all American. They provide world services but they\u2019re territorially based in the USA ... They are global utilities that have to be regulated, and that will become an issue.\u201d<br/><br/>Hussein Lootah, director general of Dubai Municipality, also highlighted the issue of access to information held outside national boundaries:<br/><br/>\u201cWe wish to have information attained and sought by any way that is proper. The most important challenge with artificial intelligence is the future of humanity. Countries and cities have to be ready for the changes ahead.\u201d<br/><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/85/151844946666.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/85/151844946666.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBUNW-109673971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBUNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RMM-4PR1-F11P-X1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343613</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Arab News - Saudi Research &amp; Publishing Co.

But the hugely invasive powers that are being unleashed may do incalculable damage if there are not sufficient checks in place to respect human rights.\"</p><p>During her visit to the Silicon Valley area from 15-18 April, the UN Human Rights Chief engaged with top executives from major tech companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce. She also discussed the challenges - and opportunities - posed by new technologies with experts and students at Stanford and Berkeley Universities, as well as with civil society organizations, diplomats, philanthropists, technologists and entrepreneurs working on tech-related issues.</p><p>\"My frank conversations with the tech companies included tough questions about the threats posed by the technologies they invented and control, as well as their positive potential,\" Bachelet said. \"These are not abstract concerns about the future, but are current reality for millions, especially the most marginalized on all continents. Directly or indirectly, new technologies are revolutionizing the way we think, the ways we are governed, the food we eat and the air we breathe. They are reaching into every corner of our existence.\"</p><p>The High Commissioner noted a few of the examples she had raised, such as the Saudi government app, distributed on the Apple App Store and in Google Play, which ostensibly provides access to government services, while also allowing Saudi men to restrict the movement of women. She also pointed to the role anti-Rohingya sentiment posted on Facebook may have played in the ethnic cleansing and possible genocide against this minority in 2017.</p><p>She noted how, in the United States, machine-learning algorithms employed in hiring processes and in the criminal justice system have been shown to have significant biases, usually against women and racial minorities.</p><p>\"There is an understandable rush to regulate new technologies. But poor regulation can be just as harmful as no regulation. Regulation of digital technology needs to find the right balance: we should not, for example, hinder innovation that could help address climate change or cure diseases. Regulation is clearly needed to respond to incitement to hatred and violence, but our natural desire to confront that threat should not lead us to strangle freedom of expression in the process.\"</p><p>In her meetings and discussions in Silicon Valley, Bachelet stressed that the well-established UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a globally recognized human rights framework for the responsibilities of business enterprises with regard to human rights, and are as applicable to advanced technologies as they are to older industries and businesses. Among other important elements, the Guiding Principles call on companies to provide remedies to individuals harmed by company involvement in human rights abuses.</p><p>\"We do not need to start from scratch,\" she said. \"The UN's human rights framework has already been endorsed across the globe and can help mitigate the impact of new technologies on human rights, while on the other hand ethics vary significantly across different countries and cultures, and can more easily be misused or ignored. Leaving individual companies on their own to develop rules and self-regulate, means placing too much power in the hands of such companies and will inevitably lead to a fragmentation of approaches where industry-wide regulation is needed.\"</p><p>\"Although some companies are wealthier and more powerful than some States, they cannot act as their substitutes,\" Bachelet said. \"States need to step in to regulate companies, but at the same time, companies need to step up to meet their own responsibilities.\"</p><p>\"We are discussing with relevant actors how to translate these principles into workable company practices,\" the High Commissioner said. \"We cannot expect Big Tech to self-regulate effectively, nor do I believe we would want them to. The onus is on both technology businesses and governments - and also civil society - to work together to identify effective and equitable policies. This is what we mean by a 'smart mix.'\"</p><p>Bachelet praised the work on the intersection of human rights and new technologies being carried out by organizations she met with during her mission such as the ACLU, Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Human Rights Watch. She described their work on various critical challenges related to facial recognition, artificial intelligence, privacy, and freedom of expression as \"both essential and inspirational.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6708804 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6708804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYS-BVC1-JC11-1099-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><timeReceived>7:33 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the hugely invasive powers that are being unleashed may do incalculable damage if there are not sufficient checks in place to respect human rights.\"</p><p>During her visit to the Silicon Valley area from 15-18 April, the UN Human Rights Chief engaged with top executives from major tech companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce. She also discussed the challenges and opportunities posed by new technologies with experts and students at Stanford and Berkeley Universities, as well as with civil society organizations, diplomats, philanthropists, technologists and entrepreneurs working on tech-related issues.</p><p>\"My frank conversations with the tech companies included tough questions about the threats posed by the technologies they invented and control, as well as their positive potential,\" Bachelet said. \"These are not abstract concerns about the future, but are current reality for millions, especially the most marginalized on all continents. Directly or indirectly, new technologies are revolutionizing the way we think, the ways we are governed, the food we eat and the air we breathe. They are reaching into every corner of our existence.\"</p><p>The High Commissioner noted a few of the examples she had raised, such as the Saudi government app, distributed on the Apple App Store and in Google Play, which ostensibly provides access to government services, while also allowing Saudi men to restrict the movement of women. She also pointed to the role anti-Rohingya sentiment posted on Facebook may have played in the ethnic cleansing and possible genocide against this minority in 2017.</p><p>She noted how, in the United States, machine-learning algorithms employed in hiring processes and in the criminal justice system have been shown to have significant biases, usually against women and racial minorities.</p><p>\"There is an understandable rush to regulate new technologies. But poor regulation can be just as harmful as no regulation. Regulation of digital technology needs to find the right balance: we should not, for example, hinder innovation that could help address climate change or cure diseases. Regulation is clearly needed to respond to incitement to hatred and violence, but our natural desire to confront that threat should not lead us to strangle freedom of expression in the process.\"</p><p>In her meetings and discussions in Silicon Valley, Bachelet stressed that the well-established UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a globally recognized human rights framework for the responsibilities of business enterprises with regard to human rights, and are as applicable to advanced technologies as they are to older industries and businesses. Among other important elements, the Guiding Principles call on companies to provide remedies to individuals harmed by company involvement in human rights abuses.</p><p>\"We do not need to start from scratch,\" she said. \"The UN's human rights framework has already been endorsed across the globe and can help mitigate the impact of new technologies on human rights, while on the other hand ethics vary significantly across different countries and cultures, and can more easily be misused or ignored. Leaving individual companies on their own to develop rules and self-regulate, means placing too much power in the hands of such companies and will inevitably lead to a fragmentation of approaches where industry-wide regulation is needed.\"</p><p>\"Although some companies are wealthier and more powerful than some States, they cannot act as their substitutes,\" Bachelet said. \"States need to step in to regulate companies, but at the same time, companies need to step up to meet their own responsibilities.\"</p><p>\"We are discussing with relevant actors how to translate these principles into workable company practices,\" the High Commissioner said. \"We cannot expect Big Tech to self-regulate effectively, nor do I believe we would want them to. The onus is on both technology businesses and governments and also civil society to work together to identify effective and equitable policies. This is what we mean by a 'smart mix.'\"</p><p>Bachelet praised the work on the intersection of human rights and new technologies being carried out by organizations she met with during her mission such as the ACLU, Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Human Rights Watch. She described their work on various critical challenges related to facial recognition, artificial intelligence, privacy, and freedom of expression as \"both essential and inspirational.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122878572</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYK-F1B1-DYTH-G11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the hugely invasive powers that are being unleashed may do incalculable damage if there are not sufficient checks in place to respect human rights.\" During her visit to Silicon Valley from April 15-18, the UN Human Rights Chief engaged with top executives from major tech companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce. She also discussed challenges and opportunities posed by new technologies with experts and students at Stanford and Berkeley Universities, as well as with civil society organizations, diplomats, philanthropists, technologists and entrepreneurs working on tech-related issues. <br/>\"My frank conversations with the tech companies included tough questions about the threats posed by the technologies they invented and control, as well as their positive potential,\" Bachelet said. <br/>\"These are not abstract concerns about the future, but are current reality for millions, especially the most marginalized on all continents. Directly or indirectly, new technologies are revolutionizing the way we think, the ways we are governed, the food we eat and the air we breathe. They are reaching into every corner of our existence.\" She also pointed to the role anti-Rohingya sentiment posted on Facebook may have played in the ethnic cleansing and possible genocide against this minority in 2017. <br/>She noted how, in the United States, machine-learning algorithms employed in hiring processes and in the criminal justice system have been shown to have significant biases, usually against women and racial minorities.  \"There is an understandable rush to regulate new technologies. But poor regulation can be just as harmful as no regulation. Regulation of digital technology needs to find the right balance: we should not, for example, hinder innovation that could help address climate change or cure diseases. Regulation is clearly needed to respond to incitement to hatred and violence, but our natural desire to confront that threat should not lead us to strangle freedom of expression in the process.\" In her meetings and discussions in Silicon Valley, Bachelet stressed that the well-established UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a globally recognized human rights framework for the responsibilities of business enterprises with regard to human rights, and are as applicable to advanced technologies as they are to older industries and businesses. <br/>Among other important elements, the Guiding Principles call on companies to provide remedies to individuals harmed by company involvement in human rights abuses. <br/>\"We do not need to start from scratch,\" she said. \"The UN's human rights framework has already been endorsed across the globe and can help mitigate the impact of new technologies on human rights, while on the other hand ethics vary significantly across different countries and cultures, and can more easily be misused or ignored. Leaving individual companies on their own to develop rules and self-regulate, means placing too much power in the hands of such companies and will inevitably lead to a fragmentation of approaches where industry-wide regulation is needed. <br/>\"Although some companies are wealthier and more powerful than some States, they cannot act as their substitutes,\" Bachelet said. \"States need to step in to regulate companies, but at the same time, companies need to step up to meet their own responsibilities. <br/>\"We are discussing with relevant actors how to translate these principles into workable company practices,\" the High Commissioner said. <br/>\"We cannot expect Big Tech to self-regulate effectively, nor do I believe we would want them to. The onus is on both technology businesses and governments - and also civil society - to work together to identify effective and equitable policies. This is what we mean by a 'smart mix.'\" Bachelet praised the work on the intersection of human rights and new technologies being carried out by organizations she met with during her mission such as the ACLU, Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Human Rights Watch. She described their work on various critical challenges related to facial recognition, artificial intelligence, privacy, and freedom of expression as \"both essential and inspirational\".

While this may sound like a dramatic over-simplification the statistics show that he may have a point. Data from the NHTSA[2] shows that 3,179 people were killed and 431,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted driving in the US in 2014 alone. </p><p>The most common cause of distraction involves looking at or using our cell phones. These facts clearly show that owning and using a smartphone can have a negative effect on our driving, but what if our phones are also part of the solution?The problem with phones on the roadAccording to Psychology Today[3], the average cell phone user 'checks their device 150 times a day.' Perhaps more worryingly, 80% of college students surveyed said they felt jealous when someone else held their phones. In a culture this smartphone-obsessed, can we really trust ourselves not to use our phones when driving? And if not, what is the solution? The above article surmised that 'The more you use your phone, satisfying your hungry neurons with the positive feedback of constant connectivity, the more you wonder how you ever lived without it.' It's a dangerous cycle, but many of us need our phones, both socially and professionally.Is it the drivers or the phones that need to change?Click4Reg[4], who specialise in online personalized number plates, suggest three ways to deter drivers from using their mobile phones[5]: tough penalties, increased presence of traffic officers, and the introduction of compulsory driving modes \u2014 essentially flight modes for cars \u2014 for all smartphones. Tougher penalties and increased traffic officer presence are two methods that focus on drivers rather than their mobiles. In the UK, the Conservative Government has introduced increases in penalties\u00a0for using their mobile phones whilst driving[6]. Someone caught using their phone behind the wheel will now receive six penalty points on their license and fines have doubled to \u00a3200 ($245). However, most people already realise that texting or using their smartphones on the road is dangerous and, if Psychology Today are right about the notion of smartphone addiction, increasingly harsh punishments won't solve the wider issue. Enter The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who are hoping to team up with Apple, Samsung, and other smartphone makers to adopt a so-called driving mode. According to The Guardian[7], the mode 'will block distractions such as social media, messages or email, stop the use of the keyboard for communication activities and also restrict access to websites, video and distracting graphics.'How your smartphone can actually save your lifeIt's not just the big tech giants that are looking into innovative ways to reduce phone-related traffic deaths. There have been a number of apps launched to help make us better, safer drivers. Could this be the silver bullet solution that we've been looking for? These app developers argue smartphones aren't just meant to be discarded to the glove compartment or placed in driving mode. Instead, smartphones could become a pertinent part of every single journey we make in our cars. Certain car insurance firms are even offering financial incentives in the form of discounts for drivers for submitting data collected by their iPhone. Apps such as EverQuote's Everdrive[8] can record particularly insightful statistics of the quality of a driver's cornering, accelerating, braking, speeding, and phone use. Some have even suggested it will eventually change the way car insurance costs are calculated. Another app aimed to improve driving is the aptly named SafeDrive[9], which, through a points system, makes safe driving competitive. You can challenge other drivers to a sort of 'safe race', and even use your points in exchange for discounted products. These apps won't completely solve the issue of distracted driving, however, they may well be the first, important step, in re-evaluating the relationship between our smartphones and our driving. Instead of being a distraction for drivers, our smartphones could play a key part in making our roads safer.

Approximately 70-percent of respondents picked as part of the representative sample used for the survey said they want to keep their smartphone data on their devices whenever such an option is a possibility. Even more are worried about digital privacy in general, with 83-percent of respondents stating they have concerns about their personal information being compromised whenever they download a new app. Nearly four in five interviewed people described data privacy as something they deem \"very important\" and said they fear they'll be hacked.\"More and more consumers are looking to corporations to protect their data, and many of these corporations are failing them,\" Anagog CEOOfer Tziperman said, adding that smartphone users are gradually becoming increasingly more informed about the concept of digital privacy and how it's being approached by the Silicon Valley and other app developers. No fewer than 95-percent of respondents said social media giants and big tech companies in general aren't doing enough to protect consumer privacy.The recent string of privacy issues and scandals made smartphone users more wary about sharing details about their lives online, as per the same source, which estimates some 82-percent of consumers now have such reservations due to the inherent risk the very act of sharing photos, location, and other sensitive data carries. </p><p>While Survey Monkey has a reputation of an established analytics company, the Anagog-commissioned survey was based on a rather minuscule representative sample consisting of just over 200 respondents. Anagog itself also has a clear interest in seeing the general public increase its interest in on-device apps as opposed to cloud ones seeing how it specializes in AI solutions using the former.Background: The noteworthy degree of skepticism smartphone users harbor about the manner in which mobile apps handle their private data can be at least partially explained by the fact that the subject at hand had an increase in media reporting over the course of the last year or so, with several high-profile cases of digital privacy violations making their way to many headlines around the world, even mainstream ones. The most obvious example of is that of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal[2], though other major names such as Google also ended up embroiled in comparable debacles, some of which even evolved into lawsuits.This August, Alphabet's subsidiary was publicly accused of misleading and dishonest[3] mobile tracking practices revolving around Android permissions which its operating system is often overriding. The firm denied those allegations, arguing all scenarios whereinthat happens were prompted by user actions. A week later, Google was hit with a lawsuit over the matter which is still seeking class-action status in California.New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas also sued Google for illegal tracking of children in mid-September. The string of issues is what partially prompted a number ofchildren's rights groups to urge theFederal Trade Commission to initiate an investigation of Android apps last month, claiming many popular games and other mobile software hurt children with misleading advertising and predatory practices implemented as part of an aggressive monetization strategy.On-device computing is inherently more secure than identical cloud-based solutions as it stores all sensitive data locally and hence offers less potential attack vectors hackers could exploit. A move toward less cloud reliance in the tech industry is still a difficult step to take, especially in the Internet of Things segment, what's widely thought to be one of the most vulnerable electronics sectors. Any kind of computing not reliant on the cloud requires more local processing power, which increases production costs and consequently ramps up the prices of consumer-grade hardware such as smartphones, computers, and smart speakers. That issue is even more pronounced in today's day and age when artificial intelligence is the name of the game across all categories of products and services. AI by itself is much more resource-intensive than traditional computing, which is what partially prompted the tech industry to look toward the cloud as an alternative solution for continued innovation in the consumer electronics segment while keeping production and maintenance costs under control.Technical challenges aside, many of today's largest names in tech offer services that are largely or entirely reliant on aggressive data-collection practices, with some of the more prominent examples being solutions such as Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter. As no technology is perfect and no security system impregnable, an increase in the amount of data collected by the tech industry naturally leads to a rise in the number of sensitive information that ends up being compromised. The United States government is reportedly only in the early stages of addressing some of those issues through regulation, whereas the European Union is a step ahead with the General Data Protection Regulation, a strict digital-privacy regulation enacted in late May which pushes for more transparency and due dilligence from anyone offering any kind of products and services that collect data. The legislature itself still hasn't been tested in the court of law and it remains unclear how effective it will end up being, though some cases are already in the pipeline and should be resolved within the next several years.Impact: Survey Monkey's latest findings suggest the general public is now certainly taking note of the latest series of incidents pertaining to data privacy. Whether that trend continues remains to be seen but the current developments aren't good news for many of the largest technology companies on the planet whose business models largely depend on user trust. Regardless, consumers\u2014 and in some cases, even tech companies\u2014continue to confuse[4] data privacy and security and not even an increase in public knowledge about hacking attacks is guaranteed to resolve that issue. What's certain is that if the aforementioned survey has a basis in reality, the Silicon Valley is already familiar with the gist of its findings and will be approaching data privacy and security much more seriously moving forward. A lot of damage has already been done, as evidenced by hundreds of millions of app user profiles that have been compromised as part of breaches discovered in the last year alone and user trust is something the industry simply cannot rebuild overnight.

It finds CBA is best placed to respond given its large technology budget and the functionality of its banking app, which Morgan Stanley rates as best among the big four.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, the latest in the investment bank's \"Australia in Transition\" series, comes a day after CBA boss Matt Comyn announced the bank would add a host of new features to its app to attract customers to its own digital wallet. He said CBA had 2 million customers already using its digital wallet.</p><p>But Morgan Stanley said customers could find digital wallets provided by Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and PayPal more attractive, because they allow various cards and accounts from different financial firms to be linked, whereas the banks' wallets only offer their own products.</p><p>\"Payments are key to the next decade of banks' growth,\" said the report, titled The Disruption we Have to Have. It has been prepared by the Morgan Stanley equities team ahead of its inaugural Australia summit branded Disruption Decoded, which is on in Sydney next week.</p><p>A key theme of the report, which also covers the consumer, software and media sectors, is that radical changes in technology make the effect on incumbent business models \"an increasingly key component of the investment decision-making process\".</p><p>While direct revenue from providing payments is a smaller proportion of overall bank revenue than the $22 billion number, the report examines how banks' payments capability influences decisions relating to other products - such as the transaction accounts that give major banks with a low-cost source of funding and avenue to cross-sell customers more profitable products such as mortgages.</p><p>Roy Morgan data from January found 6.8 per cent of Australians were using digital payments services offered by big tech companies, compared with 5.8 per cent using banks' own mobile apps.</p><p>\"We think increasingly customers are likely to base their decision [on who to bank with] on the features in the app, and a lot of those features are payments-related,\" said Richard Wiles, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley and co-author of the report. \"The capacity around payments drives decisions on which transaction account and which bank you choose as your main financial institution.\"</p><p>Regulatory settings in Australia are encouraging new players, and the concentrated retail environment also supports the rapid take-up of digital wallets, the report says. It notes the Council of Financial Regulators is reviewing the regulation of \"stored-value facilities\", which could result in more global technologies holding retail funds to facilitate payments.</p><p>Currently, PayPal has a limited authorised deposit-taking institution licence for this purpose; the report said \"a simpler regulatory framework could allow other digital wallets to offer similar services\".</p><p>With CBA saying on Tuesday it would spend $5 billion on technology over the next five years, Morgan Stanley says banks will have to continue to lift investment to compete with big tech, meaning targets to reduce absolute costs over the short term are merely aspirational.</p><p>The rising power of Apple and Google will also be supported by the government's open banking policy, by allowing them to integrate more customer data into their own wallets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc75k4idmjtmc10q9rq729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W71-SD91-F0J6-J3VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A Vulture piece on the anatomy of a beach read from May 2019 suggested that \" the overarching idea is that the book will complement the frame of mind you hope to be in \", meaning that we select light books in the hope that we find ourselves feeling similarly unencumbered when flopping onto a sandy towel at the edge of the sea.   This summer could not feel heavier, with the world trying to extricate itself from the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as facing a long overdue about reckoning about the systemic racism which has been pushed under the surface for so long.   The gulf between the frame of mine we hope to be in and the one we actually find ourselves in feels huge at the moment. Instead of warm days celebrating holidays, weddings or festivals, the sun feels like a reminder of the fun that might have happened in a parallel universe. Many are holding onto precarious employment and fearful about their health, worried about leaving the house and harbouring the fear that normal is never returning.  Photo credit: Slim Aarons -   So if summer is cancelled, or at least having a quiet year, does that mean an opportunity to rethink the summer read? Even if losing yourself in the pages of a book feels harder than usual, reading can offer a unique balm during turbulent times, whether that is escapist fiction to help turn your head or educational literature to open your eyes. As the new adage goes, get you a summer read that 'can do both' and read one of the many books which both entertain and inform, amuse and enlighten.   Kiley Reid's best-seller Such a Fun Age is top of the pile when it comes to books which have weighty subject matter lurking under the shiny surface, with Reid weaponising the novel's disguise as a light read. The narrative flits between the perspective of white feminist influencer Alix and her young black nanny Emira, using the contrast between the two to create a powerful narrative about race and privilege.     Photo credit: Amazon Prime  Similarly searing is Tommy Orange's novel from 2018, There There, which builds tension unbearably throughout as it tells the story of 12 characters colliding when they meet at the Big Oakland Powwow. Orange, himself a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma, exposes the untold stories of modern native American communities in a story that grips throughout.   Books that highlight suffering and the darkness of humanity shouldn't be exiled from summer reading lists for being too heavy, now more than ever we should be reassessing the ways we talk about different voices in literature. Esi Edugyan Man Booker Prize-nominated Washington Black is a sprawling journey of a novel told from scorching cane fields to the frozen antarctic as protagonist Wash, a man born into slavery, travels the world with his master. It feels it holds a lifetime of emotion within its pages.  Photo credit: Amazon Prime  Books which don't just frame the Black experience as suffering but are about love, friendship, humour and all of the things that make us human are essential too, and can be found in Diana Evans' Ordinary People , Brit Bennett's The Vanishing Half , Paul Mendez's Rainbow Milk and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah .    Elsewhere Matthew Klam's novel from last year Who Is Rich is utterly compulsive from the start. It is a portrait of a man in mid-life crisis mode who destroys his life which reveals far more than it lets on by the final page. It would make an excellent reading companion to Taffy Brodesser-Akner's book Fleishman is In Trouble, which has just been released in paperback, and is similarly deft in navigating gender politics and cathartic in its blistering rage.  Photo credit: Amazon Prime  One summer read that has proved strangely prescient is Ottessa Moshfegh's fever dream of a novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation. The twisted ode to isolation from 2018 follows a young girl living in 2000 New York who retreats into a cocktail of antidepressants and loses her mind. A story imbued with jet-black humour and sharp observations about solitude that will have you folding over corners of pages so you don't lose her insights.   Frances Cha's recently-released If I Had Your Face deserves a place on your bedside table too. Cha's vivid portrait of modern day Seoul shows the beauty standards which women are held to in the city where nobody blinks at plastic surgery and women compete for jobs entertaining business men in shady rooms.   Anna Wiener's recent memoir Uncanny Valley reads like taking a trip to peak app-era San Francisco and all its cramped apartments and useless Silicon Valley perks. It makes a very strong case for the regulation of big tech by revealing the egotistical idiots that pull the strings at these companies, terrifying in showing just how much they know about what we do online.   A book doesn't have to change your life to have been worth reading, but this summer at least pick something that will tear you away from your phone and one with a story that you'll remember reading.

A Vulture piece on the anatomy of a beach read from May 2019 suggested that \" the overarching idea is that the book will complement the frame of mind you hope to be in \", meaning that we select light books in the hope that we find ourselves feeling similarly unencumbered when flopping onto a sandy towel at the edge of the sea.   This summer could not feel heavier, with the world trying to extricate itself from the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as facing a long overdue about reckoning about the systemic racism which has been pushed under the surface for so long.   The gulf between the frame of mine we hope to be in and the one we actually find ourselves in feels huge at the moment. Instead of warm days celebrating holidays, weddings or festivals, the sun feels like a reminder of the fun that might have happened in a parallel universe. Many are holding onto precarious employment and fearful about their health, worried about leaving the house and harbouring the fear that normal is never returning.  Photo credit: Slim Aarons -   So if summer is cancelled, or at least having a quiet year, does that mean an opportunity to rethink the summer read? Even if losing yourself in the pages of a book feels harder than usual, reading can offer a unique balm during turbulent times, whether that is escapist fiction to help turn your head or educational literature to open your eyes. As the new adage goes, get you a summer read that 'can do both' and read one of the many books which both entertain and inform, amuse and enlighten.   Kiley Reid's best-seller Such a Fun Age is top of the pile when it comes to books which have weighty subject matter lurking under the shiny surface, with Reid weaponising the novel's disguise as a light read. The narrative flits between the perspective of white feminist influencer Alix and her young black nanny Emira, using the contrast between the two to create a powerful narrative about race and privilege.     Photo credit: Amazon Prime  Similarly searing is Tommy Orange's novel from 2018, There There, which builds tension unbearably throughout as it tells the story of 12 characters colliding when they meet at the Big Oakland Powwow. Orange, himself a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma, exposes the untold stories of modern native American communities in a story that grips throughout.   Books that highlight suffering and the darkness of humanity shouldn't be exiled from summer reading lists for being too heavy, now more than ever we should be reassessing the ways we talk about different voices in literature. Esi Edugyan Man Booker Prize-nominated Washington Black is a sprawling journey of a novel told from scorching cane fields to the frozen antarctic as protagonist Wash, a man born into slavery, travels the world with his master. It feels it holds a lifetime of emotion within its pages.  Photo credit: Amazon Prime  Books which don't just frame the Black experience as suffering but are about love, friendship, humour and all of the things that make us human are essential too, and can be found in Diana Evans' Ordinary People , Brit Bennett's The Vanishing Half , Paul Mendez's Rainbow Milk and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah .    Elsewhere Matthew Klam's novel from last year Who Is Rich is utterly compulsive from the start. It is a portrait of a man in mid-life crisis mode who destroys his life which reveals far more than it lets on by the final page. It would make an excellent reading companion to Taffy Brodesser-Akner's book Fleishman is In Trouble, which has just been released in paperback, and is similarly deft in navigating gender politics and cathartic in its blistering rage.  Photo credit: Amazon Prime  One summer read that has proved strangely prescient is Ottessa Moshfegh's fever dream of a novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation. The twisted ode to isolation from 2018 follows a young girl living in 2000 New York who retreats into a cocktail of antidepressants and loses her mind. A story imbued with jet-black humour and sharp observations about solitude that will have you folding over corners of pages so you don't lose her insights.   Frances Cha's recently-released If I Had Your Face deserves a place on your bedside table too. Cha's vivid portrait of modern day Seoul shows the beauty standards which women are held to in the city where nobody blinks at plastic surgery and women compete for jobs entertaining business men in shady rooms.   Anna Wiener's recent memoir Uncanny Valley reads like taking a trip to peak app-era San Francisco and all its cramped apartments and useless Silicon Valley perks. It makes a very strong case for the regulation of big tech by revealing the egotistical idiots that pull the strings at these companies, terrifying in showing just how much they know about what we do online.   A book doesn't have to change your life to have been worth reading, but this summer at least pick something that will tear you away from your phone and one with a story that you'll remember reading.

I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Machines are more than ever controlled by software, not humans. Occasionally it goes fatally wrong. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On March 10, 157 people died when an Ethiopian Airlines <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>737 Max 8 jet crashed. Five months earlier, another crash of the same model of airplane killed 189 people. There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Reporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didn't receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use: Under new rules, the agency delegated much of the responsibility to <person><nameText>Boeing. </nameText></person>If the software was at fault, and the problem did slip through the regulatory net, it raises questions about how safety-critical technology is vetted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Those questions will become more important over the next few years.</p><p>  A year ago, an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Uber's autonomous cars. The vehicle's autonomy systems failed to brake, as did the safety driver behind the wheel.</p><p>  Companies like Uber and Waymo, along with most of the auto industry, expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade. Such advances aren't limited to cars -- they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery. They are built on technologies, like artificial intelligence, that will make split-second decisions for humans.</p><p>  The <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>software was designed to perform a simple task: Nudge the airplane's nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated. As harder tasks are handed to software, the stakes rise.</p><p>  ''As you create more advanced A.I. systems, the harm that can result from them failing can be really large,'' said Jade Leung, a researcher at Oxford University's Center for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>  But increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult. Hardware, from chips to special sensors, can be difficult to test. And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some A.I. algorithms make decisions.</p><p>  Ms. Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tail-end risks -- the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned. That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures, ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems work.</p><p>  ''Verifying the performance and safety of software is a really, really hard technical challenge,'' Ms. Leung said. Nonetheless, it's a challenge that has to be addressed.</p><p>  Big Tech's new hustle: Cloud gaming</p><p>  When a company spends billions on world-leading digital infrastructure, it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it. That's partly what is driving Google's new Stadia gaming service, announced on Tuesday.</p><p>Google's pitch is straightforward: Think of it as Netflix for gaming. As long as they have a fast internet connection, users can pay a subscription to play high-definition games, akin to what they'd find on current top-end consoles, on any computer, phone or tablet.</p><p>  The company's promise: that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable. It will add racks of gaming-specific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an on-demand, remote gaming computer. And Google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware, lag won't be a problem -- an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms, like the now-defunct OnLive.</p><p>Google is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming. Microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer a trial of a similar service for Xbox consoles, computers and mobile devices this year. Amazon, which owns the game-watching service Twitch, is widely believed to be planning something similar, built on its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure.</p><p>  Those three companies happen to be the world's largest cloud providers. It's not surprising that they're enamored of the idea of taking a slice of the $135 billion gaming industry, when all it could take is the flex of an existing muscle.</p><p>  The U.S. struggles to supercompute</p><p>  About $500 million should buy a lot of computer. This past week, we found out how much. Writing for The Times, Don Clark explained what the Department of Energy would get for dropping that sum on a supercomputer:</p><p>  Lab officials predict it will be the first American machine to reach a milestone called ''exascale'' performance, surpassing a quintillion calculations per second. That's roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date.</p><p>  The device, called Aurora, will be used to figure out everything from how drugs work to the impact of climate change. It's also a useful indicator of the nation's competitiveness in science and technology -- or, at this point, whether it's leading or lagging behind China. On that front, Mr. Clark reports that it has been a mixed bag for the United States:</p><p>  An IBM system called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, took back the No. 1 position last year on a twice-yearly ranking of the world's 500 most powerful systems -- a spot held by China for five years. But China leads by another key measure: It accounted for 227 systems on the Top 500 list, compared with 109 for the United States.</p><p>  China is expected to have its own exascale supercomputer running as soon as 2020 -- a full year before Aurora boots up.</p><p>  And some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>Google received its third antitrust fine from the European Union since 2017. This one, for 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, was for imposing unfair terms on the search service it offers to other websites.</p><p>Facebook will stop targeting some of its ads. It will no longer allow advertising of housing, jobs or credit to be aimed at those of a certain race, gender or age group.</p><p>  The Pentagon's giant cloud contract has a one-man holdup. Deap Ubhi, a little-known entrepreneur, is at the center of a legal battle between Amazon and Oracle over the $10 billion project.</p><p>  Take a look at an early iPhone prototype. It's red, about the size of an old computer motherboard and helped engineers to program the first breakthrough smartphone.</p><p>  A.I. researchers could give computers a little more credit. Rich Sutton, a pioneer of some of today's most effective A.I. techniques, argues that a ''bitter lesson'' in artificial intelligence is that ''the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.''</p><p>  Why is there still relatively little tech regulation? ''Lawmakers are reluctant to disrupt the enormous wealth creation machine that technology has turned out to be,'' according to the security expert Bruce Schneier.</p><p>  Screen sharing can be an easy route to professional humiliation. But don't worry, the aftermath usually isn't as bad as you might think. (Even so, here are some tips for avoiding future catastrophes.)</p><p>  Jamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter.

The trend indicates that consumers are finding value in speakers that respond to voice commands to perform various tasks or services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology companies maintain that listening to the recordings captured on smart speakers will help improve the functionality of the devices, but analysts and industry experts said they need be more transparent about their data practices and also provide users with more controls over their privacy. Failing to do so, they said, could result in significant reputational and regulatory consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speakers, staff listening</p><p>A Bloomberg News report in April first revealed that Amazon.com Inc. employees listen to voice recordings captured on the company's Alexa-powered Echo smart speakers in the homes and offices of device owners. A month later, privacy groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy concerns related specifically to the company's Echo Dot Kids Edition speaker, saying the product may be violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.</p><p>A group of senators has also called for the FTC to investigate the matter.</p><p>Amazon contends that the recordings are meant to help the company improve speech recognition capabilities.</p><p>\"We only annotate an extremely small number of interactions from a random set of customers in order to improve the customer experience,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests and ensure the service works well for everyone.\"</p><p>Amazon currently dominates the smart speaker market, capturing 38.2% of the global market share of smart speakers shipped during 2018. Google LLC is not far behind, holding 30.3% of the global market share for smart speakers shipped in 2018, according to IDC.</p><p>Alexa software is designed to record audio after it detects a specific \"wake word,\" such as \"Alexa,\" but Amazon employees reportedly overhear more private interactions from Echo device owners if the Alexa software is unintentionally awakened.</p><p>Amazon EchoSource: Associated Press</p><p>Amazon also does not explicitly tell consumers that its staff is listening to their interactions with Alexa. Instead, the company says on its website: \"We use your requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.\"</p><p>Florian Schaub, a University of Michigan professor in the School of Information who has expertise in smart speakers and privacy, said in an interview that the somewhat \"vague\" privacy policies Amazon and its peers have developed makes it difficult for users to fully understand how their personal data is being handled.</p><p>\"Amazon annotating some of its recordings makes a lot of sense to me because that's the only way to improve the speech recognition technologies,\" Schaub said. \"But at the same time, the way it's doing it at the moment kind of happens behind the back of the consumer.\"</p><p>Schaub also said that large tech firms must be more \"proactive\" in educating users about the specific types of data they are collecting and why they are collecting it in order to build trust.</p><p>Cautious consumers</p><p>According to a recent IDC consumer survey, about 59% of respondents said they are \"highly concerned\" about the privacy of their smart home devices, while about three-fourths of those surveyed said they are at least \"somewhat concerned.\"</p><p>\"Security and privacy is a major concern for most consumers,\" Adam Wright, a senior analyst at IDC who conducted the survey, said in emailed comments. \"Most consumers are unhappy or unsure about sharing information with first-party device makers but are decidedly against sharing information with third-party companies.\"</p><p>Similarly, another recent study conducted by Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company, found that about 25% of U.S. broadband households that do not own a smart home device cite privacy and security concerns as the main reasons why.</p><p>Parks Associates also recently found that 44% of U.S. broadband households surveyed are \"very concerned\" that someone might gain access and control to their smart home products without their permission, while 21% said they were \"concerned.\"</p><p>\"So much is riding on voice control,\" Brad Russell, a research director at Parks Associates who has expertise in connected home technologies and data privacy, said in an interview. \"It's just a spider web of technology that's going to be everywhere   in your car, in your workplace, in the mall.\"</p><p>Russell said big tech companies must give consumers more granular controls of their data, noting it could be \"catastrophic\" if they were found to be misusing private information.</p><p>Looming legislation, regulation</p><p>In May, the California State Assembly's privacy committee advanced a bill known as the \"Anti-Eavesdropping Act\" that would prohibit makers of smart speaker devices from sharing voice recordings with third parties. Under the bill, Amazon, Google, Apple Inc. and other smart speaker providers cannot store recordings unless consumers provide their consent in writing.</p><p>\"Recent revelations about how certain companies have staff that listen in to private conversations via connected smart speakers further shows why this bill is necessary to protect privacy in the home,\" Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, R-Calif., the bill's author who introduced the legislation in January, said in a statement.</p><p>Schaub said the U.S. should consider implementing a privacy approach similar to Europe's sweeping new privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, claiming current U.S. laws are a bit too \"reactionary.\"</p><p>\"One of the big problems with how we think about regulatory frameworks with regards to privacy and consumer protections in the United States is that it's very piecemeal,\" Schaub said. \"Whereas in Europe, GDPR has a better approach in terms of clearly defining what you need to do when you're collecting personally identifiable data.\"</p><p>Among other provisions, the GDPR requires a company to obtain unambiguous affirmative consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data.</p><p>Governance matter</p><p>Given the potential for more legislation and regulation, it will be imperative for all technology companies to take the \"highest business ethics position\" to steer clear of violating consumers' personal liberties, Betsy Atkins, who is CEO and founder of venture capital firm Baja LLC and has expertise in corporate governance matters, said in emailed comments.</p><p>Ultimately, the potential for brand damage and loss of trust, Atkins said, is not worth the risk.</p><p>\"As board members this is one of the important moral compass/true north moments in balancing both short and long term and doing the appropriate stewardship for the shareholders,\" she said.</p><p>Additional smart speaker coverage:</p><p>Amazon's smart speaker for kids violates GDPR, cybersecurity experts say</p><p>Privacy group, senators ask FTC to probe Amazon over Echo Dot Kids Edition</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-51669511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3T-2961-JDVW-N0BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;
