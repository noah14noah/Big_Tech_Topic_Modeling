It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed ...</p><p>\u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d is the first film you'll watch and immediately want to toss your smartphone into the garbage can. And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.    It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.    Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn\u2019t get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \u201cI am going to work during the day and building something that then I\u2019m falling prey to,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d    The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly.    Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.    Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.    \u201cYes, perfect,\u201d Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \u201cHe\u2019s primed for an ad!\" Later: \u201cDon't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\u201d    But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \u201cMinority Report\u201d?    The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.    Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.    The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization,higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.    The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \u201cAdvertisers are the customers. We\u2019re the thing being sold.\u201d    The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \u201cpositive intermittent reinforcements\u201d and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.    Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \u201clike\u201d button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.    If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.    Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.    \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes.

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive. It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed ...</p><p>\u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d is the first film you'll watch and immediately want to toss your smartphone into the garbage can. And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.   It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.   Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn\u2019t get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \u201cI am going to work during the day and building something that then I\u2019m falling prey to,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d   The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly.   Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.   Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \u201cMad Men\u201d fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.   \u201cYes, perfect,\u201d Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \u201cHe\u2019s primed for an ad!\" Later: \u201cDon't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\u201d   But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \u201cMinority Report\u201d?   The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about.   Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.   The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate , international destabilization, higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.   The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \u201cAdvertisers are the customers. We\u2019re the thing being sold.\u201d   The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \u201cpositive intermittent reinforcements\u201d and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.   Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \u201clike\u201d button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.   If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\u201d explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.   Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.   \u201cThe Social Dilemma,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.   \u2014\u2014\u2014   MPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

By Andrew Keen. Atlantic. 330 pages. $26.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past decade or so, books decrying the internet have been published at a steady clip. These what-have-we-wrought manifestos - Evgeny Morozov's \"The Net Delusion,\" Jaron Lanier's \"You Are Not a Gadget,\" Nicholas Carr's \"The Shallows,\" to name but a few - are a chorus line of King Canutes yelling, largely in vain, against the incoming tide of insidious data mining, surveillance economies, endangered jobs and smartphone addiction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest volume to wash up on the rocky shores of doubt is \"How to Fix the Future\" by Andrew Keen, an entrepreneur turned technology pundit. Published close on the heels of his 2015 curmudgeonly treatise, \"The Internet Is Not the Answer,\" Keen's new book is far less grumpy, as the author trains his lens on tools he believes can help correct our course.</p><p>The title is a bit off. Forget the future. The book is a courageous attempt to offer some constructive solutions to a world already filled with monoliths that make the Microsoft of the 1990s, whose hegemony we once feared so much that the government saw fit to break it into pieces, look like a humble Etsy vendor.</p><p>Keen is mercifully brief with his indictments of big tech.</p><p>Just in case you need it, a quick refresher: Uber isn't merely exploiting its drivers but working overtime to render them unnecessary. Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) has tentacles in pretty much everything, including health care and education. Apple's iPhone is turning us all into zombies. Facebook, conduit of fake news, is a crime scene. And just try to go 15 minutes without using something of Google's.</p><p>So what do we do? Keen asks, reasonably enough.</p><p>Keen offers a five-part solution, consisting of greater consumer choice, social responsibility, competitive innovation, smart regulation and enlightened education. At the center, not surprisingly, is humanity itself.</p><p>In his search for the humans who are playing key roles in preserving the fundamentals of a civilized society, Keen does something admirable: He hits the road, interviewing dozens of folks around the world who are doing, and saying, interesting, innovative things.</p><p>He visits the chief technology officer of Estonia, the first country in the world to offer \"e-residency,\" an electronic passport that allows any small-business owner to use a variety of Estonian services and technologies. Intended as an antithesis to the \"dark web,\" the country is reimagining cyberspace as civic space, Keen reports.</p><p>Then there's Singapore, one of the most wired countries on the planet, where Keen explores the Smart Nation initiative, whose goal, as its politicians would have us believe, is to reinvent Singapore so that digitized information becomes the foundation of a new public space for civic innovation.</p><p>Writes Keen, \"The plan is to erect an electronic mirror that will enable (Singapore) to become ever more self aware.\"</p><p>So rosy is Keen's tone in parts that I was put in mind of a wide-eyed, if craggy-faced, 21st-century Dorothy, picking up valuable lessons on her way to Oz.</p><p>It was when Keen got to Singapore that I began to wonder if he might be looking for solutions in the wrong places. Singapore? I mean, I'd like to see cleaner sidewalks as much as the next San Franciscan, but doesn't Singapore take things a tad too far?</p><p>As Keen himself points out, human and free-speech rights champions, to say nothing of privacy advocates, aren't whistling Dixie with their worries over what Singapore might have in mind with its deployment of sensors and cameras across the island.</p><p>And the notion of e-citizenry, while fascinating, seems of questionable applicability to the United States.</p><p>Still, I came away from Keen's world travels grateful to him for enduring all those endless flights to far-flung places so we wouldn't have to.</p><p>Keen's trip to Brussels makes more sense. There he meets with Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, who is bravely standing up to the likes of Google and Apple. Vestager imposed a 13 billion-euro fine on Apple in back taxes for the company's dodgy tax arrangements with Ireland. And she has set her antitrust sights on Google. Last year, she fined the company a record 2.42 billion euros for giving preferential treatment to Google Shopping, its price comparison service.</p><p>\"How to Fix the Future\" has its share of annoyances. The phrase \"you'll remember,\" to remind us of someone or something he has mentioned plenty of times already, sometimes quite recently, becomes a distracting literary tic.</p><p>And there are mistakes. Some are easily forgiven. I can see getting Angela Merkel's name wrong (which Keen does); after all, the German prime minister isn't a constant presence in Keen's Silicon Valley-centric world. But misspelling the first names of Sergey Brin and Marc Benioff is just plain inexcusable. And an internet expert like Keen should know that science fiction writer William Gibson coined the word \"cyberspace\" not in his 1984 novel, \"Neuromancer,\" but two years earlier in his short story \"Burning Chrome.\"</p><p>Eventually our Dorothy returns to Kansas, which in Keen's case is his own backyard of Oakland, Calif. He describes with great admiration work being done by Freada Kapor Klein, a longtime tech activist. Together with her husband, Mitch Kapor, she has created a workspace in Oakland that blends high tech with humanism. Working to ensure that everyone gets a chance at a tech career, the couple invests in start-ups whose founders are women or people of color, and they've started a program that funnels underprivileged kids into math and science.</p><p>All of this, as Keen puts it, is a \"counterweight to Silicon Valley's most corrosive indifference to the impact of its disruption on the world around it.\" Well put, and a brave ambition for a scary new world.</p><p>Katie Hafner is a journalist and author.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5aa6c058bf9b5image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"How to Fix the Future\" by Andrew Keen</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Atlantic</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTCUR-1c41682a261e11e8a9e200163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTCUR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWV-R771-JCB8-W02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Post and Courier All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Post &amp;

To send an email intended for publication in this section, email scientific approach to trading.  Cramer, however, seems to prefer military history.  His columns are replete with references to such well-known traders as Robert E. Lee and Erich Ludendorff.  I can imagine Cramer humming martial tunes as he orders his funds into battle. When he feels Napoleonic, there's always La Marseillaise. (When he wants to be Hannibal, he'd have to make up his songs from the Punic Wars.) Perhaps you should include history in the trading curriculum. The battlefields may differ, but the tactics may be the same.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-- Eugene Finerman (received 6/15/98) Dismal Business\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dunlap's departure brings to mind the Buffett observation that when a guy with a reputation for excellence goes into a dismal business, it's the reputation of the business that survives.\u00a0</p><p>-- George Acton (received 6/15/98) Speech Reviews\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Just wanted to say, thanks for sharing the history and future strategy.\u00a0</p><p>-- Matt Bayly (received 6/15/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Needless to say I'm glad, to say the least, that you let TSC live. I will only be able to retire at a reasonable age if I invest. To learn that I joined TSC. Thanks Jim, Dave Kansas, and the whole crew for the education.\u00a0</p><p>-- Thomas J. Reich (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I am so happy you decided to continue with TSC. If I had known you were thinking about quitting, I would have gotten on a plane, flown there and tried to talk you out of it.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeanne Merchant (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your one weakness is charging monthly subscription rates. Once you are comfortably above break even, the monthly rate should go to $0 or at least go down significantly. The number of subscribers will mushroom.\u00a0</p><p>-- George Seay (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: It was interesting and refreshing to read the \"story\" of TheStreet.com and understand your vision for the site. As a new \"Home Depot do-it-yourself\" investor I look to the site for daily information, direction, and insight to help me make informed financial decisions. While it is important for people to understand your vision, admiration, and zest to make TheStreet.com the absolute best source for market and financial information I think it is more important for those sentiments to be echoed by your readers and for that I say kudos!\u00a0</p><p>-- Matthew Shapiro (received 6/14/98) Axing the Chainsaw\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: You were smart to unload Sunbeam. I think Michael Price wishes he had unloaded Al Dunlap sooner. Dunlap represents the dark side of American business. It takes no particular talent to take over the management of a business, fire half the payroll to produce a couple of good quarters and leave the business smoldering in your wake while you take off to \"turn around\" another company.\u00a0</p><p>-- Mark W. Zabell (received 6/15/98) Spots Be Gone\u00a0</p><p>Jesse Eisinger: Interesting story on Dusa. I had the kerotosis on the backs of both hands. At the doctor's office, they zapped each spot with each with a spray of liquid nitrogen. Just an instant of pain, like a pin prick. No further pain, quick healing, no scarring. Good luck Dusa.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeffrey Warren (received 6/14/98) The Bottom\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: In your recent column, you mentioned you have a way of spotting the bottom in a stock.  Since many of us are trying to identify the bottom in many of our favorite stocks, how about a column detailing your methodology.  You could frame it around some past experiences.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jonathan Daws (received 6/12/98) Eyes Peeled\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Thanks for your honest appraisal of Rowan and the oil services in general.  I am currently long NE and have been keeping me eyes peeled for comments from you on the subject.  I certainly value your opinion and this oil correction has been a real learing experience for me.  I am not a trader (obviously), but I also hate loosing money.  Your insight in this area has been quite helpful and look forward to your ongoing commentary.  No flames from me.\u00a0</p><p> -- Brian Fryar (received 6/12/98) Nicely Adjusted\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I think your columns this week have been nicely adjusted to state not only that value matters, but also to give specific company examples.\u00a0</p><p>Almost everyone at my office uses the \"it has gone down, now it must go up\" method and then they give themselves a pat on the back for doing so much research.\u00a0</p><p>If we have a long bear, they will all leave, muttering that the market is not to be trusted.  Will the 1980 attitude then prevail all over again?\u00a0</p><p> -- Bob Morgen (received 6/12/98) Giving Up Hope\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your comparison of Techs to oil drillers was an eye opening slap in the face.  And in my case it was probably a much needed slap in the face. I'm a big tech fan (tech investing has been so good to me over the past two years), but as your column pointed out to me -- my trading lately has been based more on hope then on strategy and discipline.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction again.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jason Winfrey (received 6/11/98) Good Advice\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith: Your GBS Training System column was the best online trading advice I've read. Period.\u00a0</p><p>I'm a retired musician, and unfortunately, not a math whiz, so when I tackle projects like writing spreadsheets, writing/running backtests, keeping paper-trading portfolios for bottom-fishing/shorting data, keeping a trading diary, etc....it's out of the greatest reluctance that I begin these daunting chores, let alone maintain them\u2026\u00a0</p><p> But you're darn right......the \"zen\" is bunk, and I *intuitively* KNEW that....I just never wanted to admit it to myself, because......hey......If I could just guess \"up\" or \"down\" right, and get \"in sync\" with the psychology, and be a \"contrarian\" trader, and blah, blah, blah.....BALONEY!!!\u00a0</p><p>I've been at this for longer than I care to admit, and your article really has me soul searching...\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I really hope you'll concentrate on this theme Gary, and develop the idea with guys like me in mind........even if it's nothing more than a step by step glimpse of how you came by the conclusion to \"buy at market\" at the open, instead of gap-open techniques with limit orders\u2026 (Did you keep records of the actual fill, vs a paper trade fill and backtest it?) And do you trade on days that open down like today ? with trend or against ?\u00a0</p><p>You know, the works ! All the details.....not necessarily to copy, but to inspire innovation.\u00a0</p><p>I don't know *anyone* else that's doing this; to the contrary, most \"trading\" sights are strictly \"wing and a prayer\" outfits, where the \"main guy\" makes a trade recommendation, and all the unfortunates within his earshot, bid up his _already-filled_ order, getting at least ONE person out with a profit. (I wish I had a nickel for every one of these I've seen.....GAH!)\u00a0</p><p>Your column is terrific, and I hope you have the editorial freedom to go so far as to suggest that we collectively get off our bums, fire the newsletter/website/cnbc/aol gurus, start converting our mistakes to data that we can learn from, like you seem to have done.\u00a0</p><p>-- Dick London (received 6/11/98) The Intel Probe\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: First, let me say that I strongly agree with you regarding the undue influence of lawyers, and other non-productive varmints, especially as it relates to distractions for companies like Intel.  Second, I agree that Intel is a great company, and they have made me a lot of money through the years, and I love their products and the speed with which they evolve.\u00a0</p><p>However, I must respectfully disagree with you that there is absolutely no anti-trust issue with respect to Intel. Sadly, they have been guilty of some tactics similar to those of MSFT in recent times since they have controlled the PC hardware.  For example, they were requiring that if a PC vendor wanted to have early system design info for each new generation of microprocessor chip, they had to use Intel motherboards (not ONLY microprocessors) in their first generation machines.  Now, if there had been a reasonable alternative source of microprocessors, this might have been reasonable, but, of course, they had a functional monopoly.  In an industry that moves as fast as the PC business, this of course meant that ALL first versions of a particular generation were on Intel motherboards, thereby precluding innovation by the PC vendor themselves.  Or, if a vendor tried to go it alone, they would not be able to have a competitive product available during the critical first months of a new generation, which would have been tantamount to commercial suicide.\u00a0</p><p>There are other examples, as well--things such as Intel customers suddenly suffering parts shortages should they agree to use chips from an Intel competitor.\u00a0</p><p>Having said all this, I actually feel that this current investigation is probably good for INTC.  At the very least,it will cause them to reassess their business practices, and (if they are still doing this sort of stuff) change in ways that are better for us, their customers.  Given that Messrs. Barrett et al. are much less likely to take the arrogant approach of Mr. Softee, I would not be surprised to see a reasonable settlement that will be an obvious winner for everyone.\u00a0</p><p> -- Dave Kisker (received 6/11/98) Leave the Crash Helmet\u00a0</p><p>The waves of \"impending crash\" caveats that accompany just about every discussion of the U.S. stockmarket caused me to recall a sage's advice that, \"the market always does what the fewest people expect\".  Well, there are certainly many people who expect a crash, but there are also a lot of people who believe the market is headed much higher.  Is there another scenario that might be developing?  I believe so.\u00a0</p><p>First, lets think about the economic background that investors face.  The Asian economies have yet to find a bottom.  Several of our telecom equipment analysts have indicated that the companies they follow should report in line second quarter results, but that companies that distribute to Asia (the manufacturer's customers) are experiencing large increases in inventory. Result: channel stuffing will enable many companies to hit June quarter forecasts, but second half forecasts will come down.  If this is true, it explains why it seems that there have been a manageable number of pre-releases this quarter.  Nonetheless, the conference calls may be a different matter.  Conclusion: Domestic U.S. economic growth is unlikely to accelerate and should begin to slow as the year progresses.  If so, inflation will be very low and with it, bond yields will decline.\u00a0</p><p>If the market does what the fewest expect, what could this scenario mean for investors?\u00a0</p><p>1. Continued high valuations (P/E, Price/Book, etc.).  This will drive the valuation crowd crazy.  Investors will scramble for anything with growth among a diminishing list of growth companies.  This view helps explain the high valuations of internet stocks --- at least they have growth.\u00a0</p><p>2. Volatile individual stock prices.  These high valuations will cause companies that disappoint to be slaughtered because confidence in future growth will be shaken (and investors will move quickly to the next hot growth story).\u00a0</p><p>3.  Slowing growth, high valuations and periodic blowups will depress the typical investor's annual returns into the mid-single digits.  Few individuals or money managers will be able to sprint through an investment landscape increasingly littered with landmines.\u00a0</p><p>4. Low bond yields will cause total returns from fixed income instruments to be less than 6%.  Although the long bond might have a bit of price upside as yields drift toward 5%, total returns elsewhere along the yield curve won't provide double digit returns.\u00a0</p><p>Bottom line: Investors may get neither mid-teens returns nor a crash that enables them to buy on the dip.  Instead, we may be headed for a several quarter period of sluggish performance as valuations gradually come back to more normal levels.  As a old consumer goods analyst, this is exactly how large cap consumer stocks behave --- a few to several years of outstanding performance, followed not by a crash, but by flat line price performance as valuations catch up (take a look at KO in the late 1980's/early 1990's, or WMT more recently).\u00a0</p><p> -- Richard Davis Jr. (received 6/11/98) Hayden's an Asset\u00a0</p><p>An asset allocator is a welcome addition to TheStreet.com. I'd like to see a debate between Cramer and Vern Hayden on whether asset allocation maximizes returns or guarantees mediocrity.\u00a0</p><p>-- Roger Mann (received 6/10/98) Rewarded\u00a0</p><p>The only people who have been rewarded by the R.S. Contrarian Fund are those of us who were smart enough to get out last October when it was first nominated for the fund graveyard. Thanks TSC. Paul Stephens doesn't have a clue!!!\u00a0</p><p> -- Jim Puffer (received 6/9/98) Y2K, Revisited\u00a0</p><p>The article on E*Trade and Y2K is very interesting, but not necessarily accurate.  Many non-legacy systems, built in the past couple of years, are still non-Y2K compliant.  I know first hand of one bank in the Northeast, which shall remain nameless, that contract to have a new system built to keep track of its trading.  They engage a consulting firm, which built the system totally with 2-digit dates.\u00a0</p><p>Webtrends 3.5, a program that I use to analyze my web site, is not Y2K compliant.  This is not only not a legacy system, it is very recent and totally Internet oriented\u00a0</p><p>This is not to say that E*Trade is not Y2K compliant, I'm simply pointing out that just because it is \"Internet\" and \"recent\" doesn't make it Y2K compliant.  Given the legacy systems it must interface with, they could very easily have Y2K issues.  The article doesn't mention any statements from the company about Y2K.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, the securities industry is far ahead of just about any other industry in terms of awareness and progress.  The initial SIA testing is scheduled for this July, and their testing methodology is available on the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeff Jacobs (received 6/9/98) Perplexed\u00a0</p><p>I am still perplexed by Jim Cramer's characterization of his stock positions as \"inventory\". As near as I can ascertain, Cramer has long term opinions about the unfolding relative improvement of certain large companies. He believes that on a short term basis the markets in those stocks reach technically diifficult to sustain short term levels of excess enthusiasm or revulsion. His trading, therefore, is broadly \"fading\" the public order flow.\u00a0</p><p>This is not, however, what I think of as securities \"inventory\", which is the raw material of a truly market-making function, or the by-product of the distribution of new issues.\u00a0</p><p>In my experience, one of the most dangerous situations a trader can find himself in is confusing speculation with a market-making discipline. It often leads to a two sets of books mentality where the interim losses are consigned to a mental investment account and the mental market-making account feels great.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Cramer's frenetic trading may be wonderfully cathartic for his hedge fund's senior partner; but one wonders at the end of the day, how much does it add to the performance of the firm's underlying, and presumably carefully formulated bets? Is it in large part grist for the insatiable moloch of Wall Street entertainment against a twice daily TheStreet deadline?\u00a0</p><p> -- Paul J. Isaac (received 6/8/98) The Ax\u00a0</p><p>Eric Moskowitz: Good series of articles on the various axes' on the Street. However, it is at times difficult to keep an eye out for comments from these analysts on a daily basis when the news agencies that report analysts upgrades/downgrades don't identify the analysts as \"axes\".  Therefore, how about you guys putting out a \"The Axe Has Spoken\" column as soon as one of these analysts makes a change in recommendation.\u00a0</p><p>-- Brett Rule (received 6/5/98) New Fan\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: Regarding the recent discussion in your column about comments directed at JJC, I offer my 2 cents. First, I began reading TSC because of JJC. I subscribed for a year (and will continue for long after that, I suppose) because of JJC. I try to read everything he writes, whether in TSC or other venues. I have learned more from him about trading than could be bought at any price at any of this country's best b-schools. I am obviously an ardent fan of his.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I am also becoming an ardent fan of yours since your arrival at TSC. Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like seeing the issues from \"both sides of the street.\" It allows one to keep a clearer head, and that is what the entire exercise of TSC should be about. The \"sniping\" is taken for what it is: the good-natured ribbing of JJC from one who also admires his work and personna, while making valid points in disagreement. As I've said to you before, keep up the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bill Luttrell (received 6/5/98) More Helpful\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: If you stop offering your perspective on the market, I'll cancel.  Although I respect JJC, and his views re trading etc. are interesting, your columns are much more helpful in my effort to understand this market as an investor.  So much noise and confusion out there!  What we need is wisdom and perspective on things. That's why I read your columns and that's why I'm still a subscriber to TSC.\u00a0</p><p>-- Tim Mikkel (received 6/5/98) Fore\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: When people hassle you about [a recent column on] Dell here is another analogy that my explain your bullishness.\u00a0</p><p>The four best golfers at a private club are Mr. Dell, Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP. They always shoot in the 70's with Mr. Dell usually shooting a couple of strokes better than the rest. There are lots of other members at the club but while being good players, they can't really compete with the big four. The club they belong to is know as an easy course(wide fairways, flat greens, few trees and sand traps). It is easy to score well. This course is the equivalent of the PC industry of the last couple of years, growth being so rapid everyone makes money.\u00a0</p><p>The big four decide to go on a golf vacation. By some miracle they are able to play Augusta National. Augusta National is the golf equivalent of today's PC environment \"HELL\". Needless to say Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP are completely overmatched by the course and shoot horrible scores. Mr. Dell sucks it up and scrambles his way to to another sub 80 round. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP put on a brave face and say they are going to head to the driving range to make a few adjustments in their game. Things will be better tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>The fundamental difference between Mr. Dell and the others(Mr IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP) is that Mr. Dell can adjust to the rapidly changing environment as the environment changes. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP get annihilated by a change in the environment, go back home reflect on what happened, develop a plan to adapt, put the plan into action and hope things will be better tomorrow. They will always be killed by a negative change in the environment(hard courses) and do well when the environment turns positive(easy courses).\u00a0</p><p>The morale of the story is that Mr Dell is a better golfer and if your going to bet on Golf then bet on Mr Dell. CREAMer always rises to the top.\u00a0</p><p> -- Mike Yaffe (received 6/5/98) Kudos\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: I don't understand people who don't \"get it\". I think the ongoing debate between the you [and James Cramer] is one of the things that make TSC an interesting forum. I, for one, am sick and tired of all the whiners who expect this to be a promtional site that has nothing but \"buys\" and positive spin. Tell them to put on their rose-coloured sunglasses and spend more time at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.justhypeme.com\">www.justhypeme.com</url> , otherwise known as Silicon Investor. As a paying customer, I would rather see fewer articles written for newbies - your sophistication and expertise is what adds value.\u00a0</p><p> -- A. John Carlesso (received 6/5/98) Remember the Akron\u00a0</p><p>Jim Cramer: Enjoy your writing, your comments have made money for me.  Thanks, and here is my favorite mental image of trading psychology.  Have you ever seen the newsreel clips of the 1920's US Airship Akron disaster? The scene is like traders' thinking about when to take the loss or hold on.  The airship was met by a party of about a hundred ground handlers grabbing the ropes when a sudden wind gust and loss of ballast control caused the ship to bob up and down twenty, thirty, forty feet three or four times before rapidly climbing to a thousand feet unable to descend and then crashing within the half hour. There was a rain of falling men from different heights.  When does the trader take his loss?  Like the ground handler he has to decide if he lets go for a 20 feet fall to suffer a broken leg or hold on for a litte longer until the ship gets back to only to only a 5 foot hop down. One could even hope to get back down uninjured.  But then what if the ship just continues up and up\u2026  This happened to the ones who didn't let go before it was too late. However, one man did survive by hanging even to a thousand feet holding on for dear life and walked away from the crash landing.\u00a0</p><p> -- Sanford Friedrich (received 6/5/98) Trust\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I welcomed the wisdom you shared yesterday, it helped put things in perspective and clearly you were right until the market got sand-bagged by the Intel whiff. You are on the money though, the trust level is down - I think that's what I was trying to articulate in my mail yesterday. Why should a trader trust a market that constantly deflates and then only partially re-inflates the next day? Clearly, for a newbie like me it's hard to see why one should - how many times do you need to get your hands burnt before you stop after all?\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps that's the most frightening thing about the market - the general feeling appears to be falling to short sentiment, which is something I haven't had much experience dealing with (I did send mail to Smith a few weeks ago to go over it since I suspected we would end up in this sort of market sometime - didn't think it would be this quick though). Here we now have people using the chats on the Net to try to move stocks down, not up - perhaps the strongest evidence I've felt that the nature of the game is changing. I sure hope I'm wrong, since this is a game that I really don't look forward to playing in.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bryan McCormick (received 6/5/98) What Intel Didn't Say\u00a0</p><p>With everything INTC has already said about business slacking off, coupled with another wave of price cuts, does Intel really need to issue another statement saying its profits/revenue/growth won't be what people thought?\u00a0</p><p> -- Erik Milstone (received 6/4/98) Turning the Tables\u00a0</p><p>Since Mr. Cramer has been on CNBC so much, I would like to see him turn the tables and invite Mark Haines to show up for Mr. Cramer's new show, Real Money.  Thanks for all the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Delosso (received 6/4/98) Instructive\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I read everything you publish on TS.com and the articles that are most instructive (to me) are the \"I Can Screw Up Too\" ones where you describe and analyze your mistakes.  I too evaluate my mistakes from every angle with the intention of learning how to avoid making the same mistake twice.  Please keep it up.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jerry Daughan, Harpswell, Maine (received 6/4/98) Stretched\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your arguments seem more stretched by the day.  For some reason you don't want to acknowledge that there is a huge slowdown at the semiconductor and boxmaker level.  Dell, GTW, may be good trades, but it's ludicrous to suggest that the fundamentals are improving.\u00a0</p><p> -- Steve Vita (received 6/4/98) No Reply\u00a0</p><p>Dan Colarusso: I have filed several e-mail type complaints with the NASDR office and the SEC enforcement-tips office over the past few months when I have seen \"blatant\" volume-spike options trading in calls or puts where there was no news, AND then after hours that company will come out with dramatic 'material' information which causes massive trading in the underlying stock the following morning-open.  Some of these instances are so damm obvious that (you or I) figure that the regulators should have been able to see it, also.  Most of the time, I never hear back from them.\u00a0</p><p> -- Gerald E. Naugle, Boulder, Colo. (received 6/4/98) Hear! Hear!\u00a0</p><p>As regards JJC's motion to start a \"conference cancellation watch\" on TSC, here's a second.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Scott (received 6/3/98) Terrific\u00a0</p><p>Gary Smith: Every time I read one of your columns I get ready to fire up the email to tell you how terrific I think your pieces are -- informative, motivating, and written with a style and dynamic (i.e., the way the words move you along) that remind me how excited I used to get when I got a sentence or paragraph right when I was writing a newsletter a number of years ago.  This time I'm going to carry through and send this off.  TheStreet.com is one of my favorite web sites and you're a big part of the reason.

Dell, Costco, Safeway, AOL, Lucent are all leaders and are all under attack daily, yet they haven't cracked their support levels. Until they do and the towel is thrown into the ring, will we really have the capitulation that is so often talked about?\u00a0</p><p>-- Frank Degley (received 6/16/98) Battling the Market\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith, I can certainly appreciate the scientific approach to trading.  Cramer, however, seems to prefer military history.  His columns are replete with references to such well-known traders as Robert E. Lee and Erich Ludendorff.  I can imagine Cramer humming martial tunes as he orders his funds into battle. When he feels Napoleonic, there's always La Marseillaise. (When he wants to be Hannibal, he'd have to make up his songs from the Punic Wars.) Perhaps you should include history in the trading curriculum. The battlefields may differ, but the tactics may be the same.\u00a0</p><p>-- Eugene Finerman (received 6/15/98) Dismal Business\u00a0</p><p>Dunlap's departure brings to mind the Buffett observation that when a guy with a reputation for excellence goes into a dismal business, it's the reputation of the business that survives.\u00a0</p><p> -- George Acton (received 6/15/98) Speech Reviews\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Just wanted to say, thanks for sharing the history and future strategy.\u00a0</p><p>-- Matt Bayly (received 6/15/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Needless to say I'm glad, to say the least, that you let TSC live. I will only be able to retire at a reasonable age if I invest. To learn that I joined TSC. Thanks Jim, Dave Kansas, and the whole crew for the education.\u00a0</p><p>-- Thomas J. Reich (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I am so happy you decided to continue with TSC. If I had known you were thinking about quitting, I would have gotten on a plane, flown there and tried to talk you out of it.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeanne Merchant (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your one weakness is charging monthly subscription rates. Once you are comfortably above break even, the monthly rate should go to $0 or at least go down significantly. The number of subscribers will mushroom.\u00a0</p><p>-- George Seay (received 6/14/98)\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: It was interesting and refreshing to read the \"story\" of TheStreet.com and understand your vision for the site. As a new \"Home Depot do-it-yourself\" investor I look to the site for daily information, direction, and insight to help me make informed financial decisions. While it is important for people to understand your vision, admiration, and zest to make TheStreet.com the absolute best source for market and financial information I think it is more important for those sentiments to be echoed by your readers and for that I say kudos!\u00a0</p><p>-- Matthew Shapiro (received 6/14/98) Axing the Chainsaw\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: You were smart to unload Sunbeam. I think Michael Price wishes he had unloaded Al Dunlap sooner. Dunlap represents the dark side of American business. It takes no particular talent to take over the management of a business, fire half the payroll to produce a couple of good quarters and leave the business smoldering in your wake while you take off to \"turn around\" another company.\u00a0</p><p>-- Mark W. Zabell (received 6/15/98) Spots Be Gone\u00a0</p><p>Jesse Eisinger: Interesting story on Dusa. I had the kerotosis on the backs of both hands. At the doctor's office, they zapped each spot with each with a spray of liquid nitrogen. Just an instant of pain, like a pin prick. No further pain, quick healing, no scarring. Good luck Dusa.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeffrey Warren (received 6/14/98) The Bottom\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: In your recent column, you mentioned you have a way of spotting the bottom in a stock.  Since many of us are trying to identify the bottom in many of our favorite stocks, how about a column detailing your methodology.  You could frame it around some past experiences.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jonathan Daws (received 6/12/98) Eyes Peeled\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Thanks for your honest appraisal of Rowan and the oil services in general.  I am currently long NE and have been keeping me eyes peeled for comments from you on the subject.  I certainly value your opinion and this oil correction has been a real learing experience for me.  I am not a trader (obviously), but I also hate loosing money.  Your insight in this area has been quite helpful and look forward to your ongoing commentary.  No flames from me.\u00a0</p><p> -- Brian Fryar (received 6/12/98) Nicely Adjusted\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I think your columns this week have been nicely adjusted to state not only that value matters, but also to give specific company examples.\u00a0</p><p>Almost everyone at my office uses the \"it has gone down, now it must go up\" method and then they give themselves a pat on the back for doing so much research.\u00a0</p><p>If we have a long bear, they will all leave, muttering that the market is not to be trusted.  Will the 1980 attitude then prevail all over again?\u00a0</p><p> -- Bob Morgen (received 6/12/98) Giving Up Hope\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your comparison of Techs to oil drillers was an eye opening slap in the face.  And in my case it was probably a much needed slap in the face. I'm a big tech fan (tech investing has been so good to me over the past two years), but as your column pointed out to me -- my trading lately has been based more on hope then on strategy and discipline.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for getting me pointed in the right direction again.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jason Winfrey (received 6/11/98) Good Advice\u00a0</p><p>Gary B. Smith: Your GBS Training System column was the best online trading advice I've read. Period.\u00a0</p><p>I'm a retired musician, and unfortunately, not a math whiz, so when I tackle projects like writing spreadsheets, writing/running backtests, keeping paper-trading portfolios for bottom-fishing/shorting data, keeping a trading diary, etc....it's out of the greatest reluctance that I begin these daunting chores, let alone maintain them\u2026\u00a0</p><p> But you're darn right......the \"zen\" is bunk, and I *intuitively* KNEW that....I just never wanted to admit it to myself, because......hey......If I could just guess \"up\" or \"down\" right, and get \"in sync\" with the psychology, and be a \"contrarian\" trader, and blah, blah, blah.....BALONEY!!!\u00a0</p><p>I've been at this for longer than I care to admit, and your article really has me soul searching...\u2026\u00a0</p><p>I really hope you'll concentrate on this theme Gary, and develop the idea with guys like me in mind........even if it's nothing more than a step by step glimpse of how you came by the conclusion to \"buy at market\" at the open, instead of gap-open techniques with limit orders\u2026 (Did you keep records of the actual fill, vs a paper trade fill and backtest it?) And do you trade on days that open down like today ? with trend or against ?\u00a0</p><p>You know, the works ! All the details.....not necessarily to copy, but to inspire innovation.\u00a0</p><p>I don't know *anyone* else that's doing this; to the contrary, most \"trading\" sights are strictly \"wing and a prayer\" outfits, where the \"main guy\" makes a trade recommendation, and all the unfortunates within his earshot, bid up his _already-filled_ order, getting at least ONE person out with a profit. (I wish I had a nickel for every one of these I've seen.....GAH!)\u00a0</p><p>Your column is terrific, and I hope you have the editorial freedom to go so far as to suggest that we collectively get off our bums, fire the newsletter/website/cnbc/aol gurus, start converting our mistakes to data that we can learn from, like you seem to have done.\u00a0</p><p>-- Dick London (received 6/11/98) The Intel Probe\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: First, let me say that I strongly agree with you regarding the undue influence of lawyers, and other non-productive varmints, especially as it relates to distractions for companies like Intel.  Second, I agree that Intel is a great company, and they have made me a lot of money through the years, and I love their products and the speed with which they evolve.\u00a0</p><p>However, I must respectfully disagree with you that there is absolutely no anti-trust issue with respect to Intel. Sadly, they have been guilty of some tactics similar to those of MSFT in recent times since they have controlled the PC hardware.  For example, they were requiring that if a PC vendor wanted to have early system design info for each new generation of microprocessor chip, they had to use Intel motherboards (not ONLY microprocessors) in their first generation machines.  Now, if there had been a reasonable alternative source of microprocessors, this might have been reasonable, but, of course, they had a functional monopoly.  In an industry that moves as fast as the PC business, this of course meant that ALL first versions of a particular generation were on Intel motherboards, thereby precluding innovation by the PC vendor themselves.  Or, if a vendor tried to go it alone, they would not be able to have a competitive product available during the critical first months of a new generation, which would have been tantamount to commercial suicide.\u00a0</p><p>There are other examples, as well--things such as Intel customers suddenly suffering parts shortages should they agree to use chips from an Intel competitor.\u00a0</p><p>Having said all this, I actually feel that this current investigation is probably good for INTC.  At the very least,it will cause them to reassess their business practices, and (if they are still doing this sort of stuff) change in ways that are better for us, their customers.  Given that Messrs. Barrett et al. are much less likely to take the arrogant approach of Mr. Softee, I would not be surprised to see a reasonable settlement that will be an obvious winner for everyone.\u00a0</p><p> -- Dave Kisker (received 6/11/98) Leave the Crash Helmet\u00a0</p><p>The waves of \"impending crash\" caveats that accompany just about every discussion of the U.S. stockmarket caused me to recall a sage's advice that, \"the market always does what the fewest people expect\".  Well, there are certainly many people who expect a crash, but there are also a lot of people who believe the market is headed much higher.  Is there another scenario that might be developing? I believe so.\u00a0</p><p>First, lets think about the economic background that investors face.  The Asian economies have yet to find a bottom.  Several of our telecom equipment analysts have indicated that the companies they follow should report in line second quarter results, but that companies that distribute to Asia (the manufacturer's customers) are experiencing large increases in inventory. Result: channel stuffing will enable many companies to hit June quarter forecasts, but second half forecasts will come down.  If this is true, it explains why it seems that there have been a manageable number of pre-releases this quarter.  Nonetheless, the conference calls may be a different matter.  Conclusion: Domestic U.S. economic growth is unlikely to accelerate and should begin to slow as the year progresses.  If so, inflation will be very low and with it, bond yields will decline.\u00a0</p><p>If the market does what the fewest expect, what could this scenario mean for investors?\u00a0</p><p>1. Continued high valuations (P/E, Price/Book, etc.).  This will drive the valuation crowd crazy.  Investors will scramble for anything with growth among a diminishing list of growth companies.  This view helps explain the high valuations of internet stocks --- at least they have growth.\u00a0</p><p>2. Volatile individual stock prices.  These high valuations will cause companies that disappoint to be slaughtered because confidence in future growth will be shaken (and investors will move quickly to the next hot growth story).\u00a0</p><p>3.  Slowing growth, high valuations and periodic blowups will depress the typical investor's annual returns into the mid-single digits.  Few individuals or money managers will be able to sprint through an investment landscape increasingly littered with landmines.\u00a0</p><p>4. Low bond yields will cause total returns from fixed income instruments to be less than 6%.  Although the long bond might have a bit of price upside as yields drift toward 5%, total returns elsewhere along the yield curve won't provide double digit returns.\u00a0</p><p>Bottom line: Investors may get neither mid-teens returns nor a crash that enables them to buy on the dip.  Instead, we may be headed for a several quarter period of sluggish performance as valuations gradually come back to more normal levels.  As a old consumer goods analyst, this is exactly how large cap consumer stocks behave --- a few to several years of outstanding performance, followed not by a crash, but by flat line price performance as valuations catch up (take a look at KO in the late 1980's/early 1990's, or WMT more recently).\u00a0</p><p> -- Richard Davis Jr. (received 6/11/98) Hayden's an Asset\u00a0</p><p>An asset allocator is a welcome addition to TheStreet.com. I'd like to see a debate between Cramer and Vern Hayden on whether asset allocation maximizes returns or guarantees mediocrity.\u00a0</p><p>-- Roger Mann (received 6/10/98) Rewarded\u00a0</p><p>The only people who have been rewarded by the R.S. Contrarian Fund are those of us who were smart enough to get out last October when it was first nominated for the fund graveyard. Thanks TSC. Paul Stephens doesn't have a clue!!!\u00a0</p><p> -- Jim Puffer (received 6/9/98) Y2K, Revisited\u00a0</p><p>The article on E*Trade and Y2K is very interesting, but not necessarily accurate.  Many non-legacy systems, built in the past couple of years, are still non-Y2K compliant.  I know first hand of one bank in the Northeast, which shall remain nameless, that contract to have a new system built to keep track of its trading.  They engage a consulting firm, which built the system totally with 2-digit dates.\u00a0</p><p>Webtrends 3.5, a program that I use to analyze my web site, is not Y2K compliant.  This is not only not a legacy system, it is very recent and totally Internet oriented\u00a0</p><p>This is not to say that E*Trade is not Y2K compliant, I'm simply pointing out that just because it is \"Internet\" and \"recent\" doesn't make it Y2K compliant.  Given the legacy systems it must interface with, they could very easily have Y2K issues.  The article doesn't mention any statements from the company about Y2K.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, the securities industry is far ahead of just about any other industry in terms of awareness and progress.  The initial SIA testing is scheduled for this July, and their testing methodology is available on the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>-- Jeff Jacobs (received 6/9/98) Perplexed\u00a0</p><p>I am still perplexed by Jim Cramer's characterization of his stock positions as \"inventory\". As near as I can ascertain, Cramer has long term opinions about the unfolding relative improvement of certain large companies. He believes that on a short term basis the markets in those stocks reach technically diifficult to sustain short term levels of excess enthusiasm or revulsion. His trading, therefore, is broadly \"fading\" the public order flow.\u00a0</p><p>This is not, however, what I think of as securities \"inventory\", which is the raw material of a truly market-making function, or the by-product of the distribution of new issues.\u00a0</p><p>In my experience, one of the most dangerous situations a trader can find himself in is confusing speculation with a market-making discipline. It often leads to a two sets of books mentality where the interim losses are consigned to a mental investment account and the mental market-making account feels great.\u00a0</p><p>Mr. Cramer's frenetic trading may be wonderfully cathartic for his hedge fund's senior partner; but one wonders at the end of the day, how much does it add to the performance of the firm's underlying, and presumably carefully formulated bets? Is it in large part grist for the insatiable moloch of Wall Street entertainment against a twice daily TheStreet deadline?\u00a0</p><p> -- Paul J. Isaac (received 6/8/98) The Ax\u00a0</p><p>Eric Moskowitz: Good series of articles on the various axes' on the Street. However, it is at times difficult to keep an eye out for comments from these analysts on a daily basis when the news agencies that report analysts upgrades/downgrades don't identify the analysts as \"axes\".  Therefore, how about you guys putting out a \"The Axe Has Spoken\" column as soon as one of these analysts makes a change in recommendation.\u00a0</p><p>-- Brett Rule (received 6/5/98) New Fan\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: Regarding the recent discussion in your column about comments directed at JJC, I offer my 2 cents. First, I began reading TSC because of JJC. I subscribed for a year (and will continue for long after that, I suppose) because of JJC. I try to read everything he writes, whether in TSC or other venues. I have learned more from him about trading than could be bought at any price at any of this country's best b-schools. I am obviously an ardent fan of his.\u00a0</p><p>That said, I am also becoming an ardent fan of yours since your arrival at TSC. Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but I like seeing the issues from \"both sides of the street.\" It allows one to keep a clearer head, and that is what the entire exercise of TSC should be about. The \"sniping\" is taken for what it is: the good-natured ribbing of JJC from one who also admires his work and personna, while making valid points in disagreement. As I've said to you before, keep up the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bill Luttrell (received 6/5/98) More Helpful\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: If you stop offering your perspective on the market, I'll cancel.  Although I respect JJC, and his views re trading etc. are interesting, your columns are much more helpful in my effort to understand this market as an investor.  So much noise and confusion out there!  What we need is wisdom and perspective on things. That's why I read your columns and that's why I'm still a subscriber to TSC.\u00a0</p><p>-- Tim Mikkel (received 6/5/98) Fore\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: When people hassle you about [a recent column on] Dell here is another analogy that my explain your bullishness.\u00a0</p><p>The four best golfers at a private club are Mr. Dell, Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP. They always shoot in the 70's with Mr. Dell usually shooting a couple of strokes better than the rest. There are lots of other members at the club but while being good players, they can't really compete with the big four. The club they belong to is know as an easy course(wide fairways, flat greens, few trees and sand traps). It is easy to score well. This course is the equivalent of the PC industry of the last couple of years, growth being so rapid everyone makes money.\u00a0</p><p>The big four decide to go on a golf vacation. By some miracle they are able to play Augusta National. Augusta National is the golf equivalent of today's PC environment \"HELL\". Needless to say Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP are completely overmatched by the course and shoot horrible scores. Mr. Dell sucks it up and scrambles his way to to another sub 80 round. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP put on a brave face and say they are going to head to the driving range to make a few adjustments in their game. Things will be better tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>The fundamental difference between Mr. Dell and the others(Mr IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP) is that Mr. Dell can adjust to the rapidly changing environment as the environment changes. Mr. IBM, Mr. Compaq and Mr. HP get annihilated by a change in the environment, go back home reflect on what happened, develop a plan to adapt, put the plan into action and hope things will be better tomorrow. They will always be killed by a negative change in the environment(hard courses) and do well when the environment turns positive(easy courses).\u00a0</p><p>The morale of the story is that Mr Dell is a better golfer and if your going to bet on Golf then bet on Mr Dell. CREAMer always rises to the top.\u00a0</p><p> -- Mike Yaffe (received 6/5/98) Kudos\u00a0</p><p>Herb Greenberg: I don't understand people who don't \"get it\". I think the ongoing debate between the you [and James Cramer] is one of the things that make TSC an interesting forum. I, for one, am sick and tired of all the whiners who expect this to be a promtional site that has nothing but \"buys\" and positive spin. Tell them to put on their rose-coloured sunglasses and spend more time at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.justhypeme.com\">www.justhypeme.com</url> , otherwise known as Silicon Investor. As a paying customer, I would rather see fewer articles written for newbies - your sophistication and expertise is what adds value.\u00a0</p><p> -- A. John Carlesso (received 6/5/98) Remember the Akron\u00a0</p><p>Jim Cramer: Enjoy your writing, your comments have made money for me.  Thanks, and here is my favorite mental image of trading psychology.  Have you ever seen the newsreel clips of the 1920's US Airship Akron disaster? The scene is like traders' thinking about when to take the loss or hold on.  The airship was met by a party of about a hundred ground handlers grabbing the ropes when a sudden wind gust and loss of ballast control caused the ship to bob up and down twenty, thirty, forty feet three or four times before rapidly climbing to a thousand feet unable to descend and then crashing within the half hour. There was a rain of falling men from different heights.  When does the trader take his loss?  Like the ground handler he has to decide if he lets go for a 20 feet fall to suffer a broken leg or hold on for a litte longer until the ship gets back to only to only a 5 foot hop down. One could even hope to get back down uninjured.  But then what if the ship just continues up and up\u2026  This happened to the ones who didn't let go before it was too late. However, one man did survive by hanging even to a thousand feet holding on for dear life and walked away from the crash landing.\u00a0</p><p> -- Sanford Friedrich (received 6/5/98) Trust\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I welcomed the wisdom you shared yesterday, it helped put things in perspective and clearly you were right until the market got sand-bagged by the Intel whiff. You are on the money though, the trust level is down - I think that's what I was trying to articulate in my mail yesterday. Why should a trader trust a market that constantly deflates and then only partially re-inflates the next day? Clearly, for a newbie like me it's hard to see why one should - how many times do you need to get your hands burnt before you stop after all?\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps that's the most frightening thing about the market - the general feeling appears to be falling to short sentiment, which is something I haven't had much experience dealing with (I did send mail to Smith a few weeks ago to go over it since I suspected we would end up in this sort of market sometime - didn't think it would be this quick though). Here we now have people using the chats on the Net to try to move stocks down, not up - perhaps the strongest evidence I've felt that the nature of the game is changing. I sure hope I'm wrong, since this is a game that I really don't look forward to playing in.\u00a0</p><p> -- Bryan McCormick (received 6/5/98) What Intel Didn't Say\u00a0</p><p>With everything INTC has already said about business slacking off, coupled with another wave of price cuts, does Intel really need to issue another statement saying its profits/revenue/growth won't be what people thought?\u00a0</p><p> -- Erik Milstone (received 6/4/98) Turning the Tables\u00a0</p><p>Since Mr. Cramer has been on CNBC so much, I would like to see him turn the tables and invite Mark Haines to show up for Mr. Cramer's new show, Real Money.  Thanks for all the good work.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Delosso (received 6/4/98) Instructive\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: I read everything you publish on TS.com and the articles that are most instructive (to me) are the \"I Can Screw Up Too\" ones where you describe and analyze your mistakes.  I too evaluate my mistakes from every angle with the intention of learning how to avoid making the same mistake twice.  Please keep it up.\u00a0</p><p> -- Jerry Daughan, Harpswell, Maine (received 6/4/98) Stretched\u00a0</p><p>James Cramer: Your arguments seem more stretched by the day.  For some reason you don't want to acknowledge that there is a huge slowdown at the semiconductor and boxmaker level.  Dell, GTW, may be good trades, but it's ludicrous to suggest that the fundamentals are improving.\u00a0</p><p> -- Steve Vita (received 6/4/98) No Reply\u00a0</p><p>Dan Colarusso: I have filed several e-mail type complaints with the NASDR office and the SEC enforcement-tips office over the past few months when I have seen \"blatant\" volume-spike options trading in calls or puts where there was no news, AND then after hours that company will come out with dramatic 'material' information which causes massive trading in the underlying stock the following morning-open.  Some of these instances are so damm obvious that (you or I) figure that the regulators should have been able to see it, also.  Most of the time, I never hear back from them.\u00a0</p><p> -- Gerald E. Naugle, Boulder, Colo. (received 6/4/98) Hear! Hear!\u00a0</p><p>As regards JJC's motion to start a \"conference cancellation watch\" on TSC, here's a second.\u00a0</p><p> -- Tom Scott (received 6/3/98) Terrific\u00a0</p><p>Gary Smith: Every time I read one of your columns I get ready to fire up the email to tell you how terrific I think your pieces are -- informative, motivating, and written with a style and dynamic (i.e., the way the words move you along) that remind me how excited I used to get when I got a sentence or paragraph right when I was writing a newsletter a number of years ago.  This time I'm going to carry through and send this off.  TheStreet.com is one of my favorite web sites and you're a big part of the reason.

Reflecting local topography, there's Silicon Glen, Silicon Fen, Silicon Roundabout, Silicon Steppe and, most egregiously, Philicon Valley (take a bow Philadelphia), among other wannabes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there's only one Silicon Valley. How to explain the sui generis success of this \"high-tech Galapagos?\" Margaret O'Mara's \"The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America\" sets out to crack the elusive code behind the code that has supplanted fruit as the valley's main export. The result is a fresh, provocative take that upends the self-serving mythologizing of the valley's own.</p><p> Conventional wisdom depicts the valley as a place apart, remote from and unbeholden to old power centers, the product of rugged individualism, its history a pageant of eureka moments in garages and dorm rooms. In this telling, government figures barely \u2014 as a scold or spoiler to be kept at bay \u2014 if at all.</p><p> Margaret O'Mara is the author of \"The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America\" (Penguin; 512 pages; $30). Photo: Jim Garner</p><p> A historian who worked in the Clinton administration before entering academia, O'Mara posits a counter-narrative in which the valley owes its origins \u2014 and survival during lean times \u2014 to defense contracts, and government emerges as \"perhaps its greatest \u2026 venture capitalist.\" Whirring away in the background like electrical current through computer circuitry: a nexus of money, power and influence between the valley and Washington that predates Al Gore's internet boosterism, Obama officials' coziness with big tech or Google's high-powered D.C. lobbying operation.</p><p> But O'Mara is hardly proposing the valley as a creature of big government-by-stealth or enlightened bureaucratic design. Rather, the workings of government there have often been indirect, sometimes inadvertent, she writes, as much rooted in omission as commission \u2014 dwelling in the negative space of inaction and permissive regulation besides \"largesse\" and purposeful programs. Either way, a constant has been intensive politicking by valley brass \u2014 for all their professed libertarianism or apolitical leanings, far from passive recipients of grace and favor. It's a frame that casts familiar figures in a new light. Storied venture capitalist John Doerr provided seed capital to Amazon, Google, Sun and Netscape but, an emissary to Washington's elite, arch coalition builder and lobbyist in chief for the industry, he was also a consummate \"policy entrepreneur,\" O'Mara points out.</p><p> \"The Code\" doesn't skimp on the milestones of valley lore \u2014 the \"traitorous eight\" splitting from Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild Semiconductor and modern-day Silicon Valley; or, \"the mother of all demos\" showcasing \"the mouse, interactive computing, hyperlinks, networked video and audio\" in 1968. But O'Mara spotlights the village of institutions, networks and ancillary services \u2014 corps of bankers, lawyers and marketers overlooked in many accounts of the valley's exceptionalism \u2014 behind the big moments.</p><p> She also supplements them with a concatenation of ostensibly small deeds, obscure statutes, legislative arcana and legal loopholes that proved deeply consequential.</p><p> Consider an alternative valley timeline beginning with the 1958 Small Business Investment Act: in its generous matching loans for startup investors a catalyst for the first wave of VC firms.</p><p> And in 1994, when merchants eyed the nascent web as a medium of commercial exchange but consumers balked at entrusting their credit card to websites, enter the government with a means of protecting this data that laid down the rudiments of secure online transactions and helped jump-start e-commerce \u2014 perhaps \"the greatest return on investment in Valley history.\"</p><p> Meantime, we're still living with the reverberations of fine print in the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Industry lobbying, and the efforts of civil liberties advocates, purged it of sanctions against online porn peddlers but not a clause absolving platforms of responsibility for content posted to their sites.</p><p> Overall, the Clinton administration ensured the infant web wasn't captured by big business, but also that it wasn't smothered by regulation.</p><p> Then there's the outsize impact \u2014 for better and worse \u2014 of California's proscription of non-compete job contracts, allowing workers to decamp with impunity to rival firms. This has fostered a certain industry-wide collegiality, not to mention a fluid job market. And it's led to referral-based recruitment that's proved expedient in tapping an industry-wide pool in which new hires are readily attuned to a prevailing culture and, interchangeable as widgets, quickly productive. But it's also contributed toward a hermetic culture \u2014 self-propagating, incestuous and insular \u2014 in which recruitment has too often been confined to \"charmed circles\" of white, maybe Asian men, O'Mara writes. The result: \"programmed in sharp gender and racial imbalances\" \u2014 the valley's historical blind spots, all the more glaring for their coexistence with its often otherwise progressive mores.</p><p> Such happenstances lack the sexiness of hackathons and product launches, but they've been formative in the valley's culture and products. And they're of more than academic interest as the pervasiveness of the valley's cultural currency and products makes its pathologies, besides its ingenuities, the concern of us all.</p><p> Ironically, at a time when this influence is maximally felt, the valley is on its way to physically obsoleting itself, O'Mara adds. The cloud liberates entrepreneurs from place, permitting them to rent computing power and tap remote teams rather than investing in pricey hardware and on-site teams. And how many scrappy founders can afford to bootstrap a company in today's valley? The obituaries are already being written. But the valley's been written off before.</p><p> The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</p><p> By Margaret O'Mara</p><p>Penguin Press</p><p> (512 pages; $30)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-e5ec8d643b6922ccdf3edc0dc728142d67fd97</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH5-CRG1-DXVP-V162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I am of that sandwiched generation who grew up with pens, typewriters and the indentation of the tip of the index finger that came from phone dialling. Then we adapted to PCs and smartphones and have been inclined towards gratitude for the way our lives were made easier and more interesting by the work of the Silicon Valley techies. That gratitude, however, is dying with us; the cursors turning to curses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Noam Cohen's book is a competent, slightly humourless concoction - half polemic, half potted biographies of the big figures of Big Tech. Most significantly it is a not untypical representative of the mood of disenchantment. For him, Bill Gates and <person><nameText>Larry Page </nameText></person>are the Andrew Carnegies and JP Morgans of the millennial cusp - lawless robber barons who fix the terms of trade to suit themselves, then preen around giving money to charity and proclaiming their own virtues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"These Silicon Valley leaders,\" he writes, \"propose a society in which personal freedoms are near absolute and government regulations wither away, where bold entrepreneurs amass billions of dollars from their innovations and the rest of us struggle in a hypercompetitive market without unions, government regulations, or social welfare programs to protect us.\"</p><p>The good old world is destroyed. \"Local stores, local newspapers, local unions, local political organisations are swept away as tech companies centralise profits.\" The small, intimate collective life (albeit governmentally regulated) of the prelapsarian world is flooded by their infernal devices, which by some semi-hypnotic power force us to buy them, use them and replace other things with them, despite ourselves.</p><p>Cohen has written on tech for, among others, The New York Times and knows something of the field. But if he is aware of the history of disruption (ie the history of human development) he doesn't acknowledge it. For Big Tech read Big Pharma, supermarket chains, the automobile, the railways, bankers, printing, Rupert Murdoch, cable TV, movies, novels and agriculture. Each and all of them has been accused of subverting the more natural and more local (and inevitably more hierarchical) order of things.</p><p>Today the cycle of disenchantment is ever quicker. It took us some time to get cross with Google for making so much money out of advertising to us, less to become angry with Facebook for exploiting our personal information, and almost none at all to go from regarding Uber and Airbnb as modern miracles to seeing them as sinks of exploitation.</p><p>According to Cohen, the Australopithecus of the evolutionary strain that led to Silicon Man and thence to Uber was developed in the postwar labs and offices of Stanford University in California. Situated in what became Silicon Valley, Stanford was a poor relation to the Ivy League schools, and to survive created a new model of entrepreneurial research. Its dean of engineering, the creator of Stanford Industrial Park and finally provost until 1965, was Frederick Terman. He sought out and procured some of the leading talents in emerging technologies and encouraged a model whereby they could develop and profit from the innovations their work created.</p><p>Just a generation ago the practical (and profitable) application of university research to industry was considered something of a grail. And Stanford was a model for it. Cohen invites us to see this joining of academia and enterprise as a grisly mixed marriage that brought forth the mutant that is ruining our world. From outside it is hard not to see it rather as an enlightened strategy that placed the US in the forefront of the technologies that have transformed the past three decades.</p><p>The once-heroes now antiheroes of Silicon Valley each get their shortish chapters. Gates of Microsoft is here, as are Marc Andreessen of Netscape, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, <person><nameText>Larry Page </nameText></person>and Sergey Brin of Google, Peter Thiel of Paypal, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. They're all men, they're all white, they're all rich and, as far as Cohen is concerned, they're all the same. So the politics of the one Trump supporter, Thiel (who is a conflicted libertarian), is held to represent the logical destination of all of them, even though most of them opposed Trump.</p><p>The most interesting chapter for me is the one on John McCarthy, the originator of the term \"artificial intelligence\". McCarthy was the son of American communists, both of whom worked for the party paper, the Daily Worker. At 17 he was an activist, but at the height of the Cold War drifted out of politics and dedicated himself to the new science of computing. He was one of the people poached by Terman to go to Stanford, where he helped to set up the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1965.</p><p>Told by Cohen, McCarthy's journey is just another (and regrettable) drift from the left of his youth to the right of his senescence. And despite his many innovations and accurate predictions of the shape of the world to come, McCarthy's main significance for Cohen lies in his reaction to one incident that took place in 1989.</p><p>It was then that McCarthy successfully argued against taking down one of the new internet forums hosted, but not run by Stanford - rec.humor.funny - on the basis that it carried racist and offensive jokes. McCarthy's view was that the internet needed to be a place where free expression was allowed at all times.</p><p>Cohen believes that McCarthy's campaign was the origin of what Cohen sees as a terrible flaw. He writes: \"Either you accepted offensive speech online or you were in favour of burning books. There would be no middle ground permitted, and thus no opportunity to introduce reasonable regulations to ensure civility online, which is our predicament today.\" Following McCarthy's dictum means that Facebook, Google and Twitter have \"encouraged the public to stew in their own hateful juices and profited handsomely in the process\".</p><p>It's ironic that a journalist such as Cohen should regard a commitment to freedom of expression as an essentially right-wing characteristic. McCarthy, of course, coming from a communist background, may have sensed more accurately the dangers involved in restricting what people could say on what would become the great universal platform. McCarthy may have read Orwell.</p><p>The problem is that the \"middle ground\" suggested by Cohen requires someone to decide what it is and to police it. It needs a censor. And why go to the trouble of burning books if you can use an algorithm to expunge certain kinds of expression?</p><p>I don't mean that Cohen is always wrong. Big money often means big arrogance and needs big oversight. But his alternative nirvana of a lovely big, diverse, chaotic Gormenghast of an internet, all free and yet somehow all regulated, with only good things happening and sin somehow filtered out by the actions of volunteer curators, is chimerical. Like all utopias, in practice we wouldn't like it when we got there.The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ballby Noam Cohen, Oneworld, 272pp, \u00a318.99</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-40070334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RD4-TPD1-F021-64ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 13, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

It's a bit breathless in its quest to paint technology as a relentless enemy, but it's pacey, and, when it comes to the workings of Big Tech, the blogger Jamie Bartlett clearly knows his stuff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bartlett is director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the think tank Demos. He believes that democracy and technology are locked in a battle that only one of them can win.</p><p>I'll come back to the democracy bit. Bartlett is at his strongest when explaining the inner workings of Big Tech. Every click and swipe builds the machine, which in turn exploits us for profit. We have all been complicit in building this machine, by giving away our data, and it's time to wise up.</p><p>He brings home, chillingly, the menacing passivity of algorithms. \"I highly doubt,\" he writes, \"that any one Google employee fully understands the company's algorithms, much like no single worker could now make a car or a pencil.\"</p><p>Algorithms update themselves, without human intervention. The logical goal, he writes, would be \"for each of us to be reduced to a unique, predictable and targetable data point\". You don't have to be quite that apocalyptic to feel alarmed that the YouTube algorithm \"shapes what 1.5 bn users are likely to see\". That's more than every newspaper in the world.</p><p>The book comes to life when Bartlett goes on the road. He mixes with crypto-anarchists in a cafe that, kookily, only accepts bitcoin. He meets a former tech executive who has bought guns and retreated to a remote island, appalled by the prospect of being watched. He conjures up some terrifying, sci-fi images: one is of drones the size of bumblebees that could use facial recognition to find and kill you.</p><p>He also visits Project Alamo, the heart of the Republican Party's campaign to win votes. There are detailed descriptions of how Cambridge Analytica, Vote Leave and <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn's </nameText></person>Labour Party have used big data. Cambridge Analytica apparently had the stunning insight that potential Trump voters tended to prefer American-made cars: I found myself hoping that no one was foolish enough to pay them for that.</p><p>Something I hadn't realised, but People vs Tech explains, is that being a \"platform\" rather than a \"publisher\" is not wholly positive for Mark Zuckerberg. Sunday Times readers will be aware that platforms don't have to exercise the same kind of responsibility as the editor of this newspaper. But Bartlett explains that this has created a dilemma for YouTube and Facebook. Knowing that lawmakers would like to regulate them as publishers, which would force them to comb through mountains of data, these companies are taking care not to behave too much like publishers, even to the extent of not cleaning out divisive or misleading stories. That will surely become a bigger and bigger problem for them - and their shareholders.</p><p>I found myself parting company with Bartlett on several occasions. He argues that social media creates a kind of permanent visibility, of \"watching and being watched\", which makes us more pliable. But it doesn't feel like that on Twitter. There is undeniably something in the idea that we are scared of the mob, but I don't accept that the silent majority have stopped thinking for themselves.</p><p>The book's overall thesis is that we have, \"in exchange for the undeniable benefits of technology, allowed other components of a functioning political system to be undermined: control, parliamentary sovereignty, economic equality, civil society and an informed citizenry\". I wasn't sure about that list, to be honest. No free society has true \"economic equality\", although Bartlett seems to think it should: he veers off-piste to talk about universal basic income. And while Brexit has certainly shrunk the power of parliament on that particular issue, because direct democracy trumps representative democracy, I don't agree with Bartlett that voters are hankering after ever more referenda. It seems to me it's quite the opposite.</p><p>I did wish Bartlett wouldn't keep letting his prejudices slip. He pulls together strong evidence of growing polarisation and intolerance in the echo chamber of social media. But he also makes quite clear that he thinks anyone who voted for Brexit or Trump is an idiot. It does not seem to occur to him that those people were perhaps not being manipulated by bots, but were fed up with the political elite and exercising their democratic right to say so.</p><p>What are Bartlett's solutions? He wants us all to become more discerning and sceptical about what we encounter online. He also believes that we must stop ourselves becoming too distracted, because distraction and information overload make us more likely to delegate decisions to demagogues or faceless algorithms. He is surely right about that - and there's an endearing moment when he discovers that he is checking his own phone 77 times a day.</p><p>He is light on how Big Tech should be regulated. He wants government inspectors to be able to \"look under the bonnet\" and examine digital algorithms - a power that some of us have already suggested should be given, in the UK, to the Information Commissioner. But he deals only fleetingly with the break-up of monopolies, which will surely be critical. I would have liked to read more detail on that, and on the \"new digital ethics\" that he wants companies to embrace but doesn't define. I also thought he might have said something about simplifying turgid \"terms and conditions\" which, he reminds us, we all solemnly tick without having a clue.</p><p>I enjoyed this book. It made me think. But I came away feeling that I have more faith in people than does the author. Perhaps that makes me naive, or superannuated. But punters can abandon Facebook, just as they left Myspace and Bebo. And People vs Tech makes clear that there is still time - just - for us to take back control.Ebury \u00a38.99 pp256Camilla Cavendish was head of David Cameron's policy unit at 10 Downing Street from 2015 to 2016</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-43152866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3R-YY41-JCJY-G4WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 15, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ultimately the courts \u2013 including the Supreme Court \u2013 can decide only whether the Department of Justice\u2019s approach passes muster under current law,\" the statement read.</p><p>Smith underlined that despite the court's decision the majority of the work should be done by the US Congress, calling on the legislative body to adopt a law that would correspond to today's realities.</p><p>\"But while attention today will focus on the Supreme Court, we believe the most important work should take place in the Capitol building across the street, by the U.S. Congress ... The courts are not able to write a new law. Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can do that, using its tools to craft a nuanced solution that balances all the competing concerns by enacting a statute for the 21st century,\" Smith stressed.</p><p>TOUGHER PRIVACY RIGHTS PROTECTION IN EUROPE</p><p>The European Union is closely monitoring the case, since similar problems exist across across the Atlantic. In May 2018, the European Union is expected to introduce its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The new legislation will replace the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and harmonize data privacy laws across Europe to protect all EU citizens in their data privacy and reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.</p><p>\"There is a huge difference between what countries can decide in joint agreements on mutual legal assistance, and criminal law for individuals, where extraterritoriality cannot just be overruled like that. Microsoft is actually followed by the Irish government, when it refuses to deliver the emails that the US justice department requests. Can you imagine any dictatorship requesting tomorrow the same sort of access to its citizens\u2019 data abroad?\" a lawyer representing a big tech company said anonymously to Sputnik.</p><p>The GDPR will be tough for companies, organizations and individuals within Europe. In particular, the new privacy rights legislation is expected to extend its territorial competence to the organizations outside the European Union that provide goods and services to data subjects in the European Union.</p><p>In addition, the GDPR will require companies to make their requests for the processing of personal data consent more informative concrete and unambiguous.</p><p>EU SEEKS ACCESS TO PRIVATE DATA STORED OUTSIDE UNION</p><p>When it comes to access to private data in the interest of the EU authorities, EU member states still want to be a able to obtain information on servers across borders. That is why the European Commission is currently preparing relevant legislation.</p><p>\"The EU executive wants law enforcement authorities to be able to access electronic evidence stored within the 28-nation bloc. This is known for a while and nothing new, there is a proposal in preparation on access to e-evidence for law enforcement (investigations and evidence within the EU). It was already discussed in the Justice council previously,\" Christian Wigand, a European Commission spokesman, told Sputnik.</p><p>The scope of the planned European legislation extends to data held elsewhere than in the European Union, which, according to experts, will be difficult to implement in reality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RNSNWS-160ROS34769109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RNSNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRT-Y0S1-DY43-6219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442979</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><timeReceived>8:31 PM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Rossiya Segodnya All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sputnik News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16346\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It takes a while to appreciate he is furious, granted, because he is a ponderous writer, and in World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech he is apt to get distracted from his fury with lengthy passages about things such as the history of bookshelves, or whether Descartes really built a robot that looked like his dead daughter, Francine, which was thrown off a boat. (No.) But furious he definitely is. As the subtitle suggests, he believes that tech companies are ruining the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Oh, that again,\" you might think. Foer, though, is well placed to make this criticism, because before tech companies started ruining the world, they first ruined his. Foer resigned/was fired in 2014 as editor of The New Republic, one of those liberal New York magazines that people pretend to read, due to disagreements with his proprietor. That proprietor was Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook, who had bought an old media company and was set upon turning it into a new media company. Foer, who oozes old media despite not really being old enough, was far from keen on this.</p><p>Foer believes that tech companies have degraded the intellectual discourse of not just social media users, but also civilisation at large. They have, he argues, assaulted the very foundation of knowledge. For Foer, the foundational text of Silicon Valley was The Whole Earth Catalog, a countercultural magazine run by Stewart Brand in the late 1960s, which sought to spread niche knowledge to the hippy masses. Brand came up with the maxim \"information wants to be free\". Foer puts this as the inspiration behind Google's desire to scan every book in existence, waging war on the concept of copyright. The idea is that maximum human knowledge should lead to maximum human enlightenment.</p><p>Yet that's not what happened. For one thing, when you have endless available information you hit what David Foster Wallace called \"total noise\", an impenetrable blurt of everything. The historical problem of scarcity of information - the problem early tech evangelists sought to solve - has morphed instead into a scarcity of attention.</p><p>People need to filter. The tech answer to this is an algorithm, but algorithms are not neutral. Foer points out that Netflix and Amazon offer recommendations to their users, for example, but there the similarities end. Amazon directs its users to more familiar products (one third of its purchases come from its recommendations), whereas subscription-based Netflix directs its users to the unfamiliar because blockbuster movies cost more to stream.</p><p>Foer has a slightly tweedy disdain for the philistines of tech. You can feel the sneer, for example, in his quoting of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, when he complains about physical books, \"turning the pages . . . the book is always flopping itself shut at the wrong moment\". Coming from a man whose firm sells 40 per cent of all books bought, this hurts.</p><p>Upworthy would create 25 headlines per story and study which one did best</p><p>Even so, Foer's denunciation of online journalism, which comes in his book's best chapter, is not just powerful, but essential reading for any journalist, or indeed reader of journalism. He notes that a memoir by the critic Alfred Kazin recalls that the fee for a book review in The New Republic of the 1930s was $150. Despite 80 years of inflation, Foer points out, this is also, dollar for dollar, the fee for a book review for the same magazine's website. Everything is falling apart.</p><p>\"The core insight of Upworthy, Buzzfeed, Vox and other emerging internet behemoths,\" he writes, \"was that editorial success could be engineered.\" A company can study which topics get the most clicks, and which writers. This has led to the phenomenon of headlines with a \"curiosity gap\". Upworthy, for example, once garnered 6 million clicks from the headline \"9 Out Of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact\". The fact in question was merely a dry statistic about income inequality. At the time, the company would create 25 headlines per story, and study which one did best.</p><p>Meanwhile, another internet trend has been to render articles \"untethered entities\" in much the same way that Apple's iTunes model ripped singles out of albums. The upshot, with both, is that the fun stuff soars and the worthy stuff fades away.</p><p>Foer's first contention is that this leads to nonsense. For example, last year's inconsequential story about a Minnesota dentist shooting a lion (Cecil, you remember) generated an astonishing 3.2 million individual stories online, which he calls \"a deluge of ephemera dissecting the ephemeral\".</p><p>His second, more contentious contention is that it led to the election of Donald Trump, because the news chased easy hits and Trump's outrages provided them.</p><p>In the end, \"Facebook leads us to a destination that is the precise opposite of its stated ideal\". In a nutshell, giving everybody everything was supposed to enlighten. Instead, because information requires curation, we end up with less.</p><p>Where Foer breaks ground is in elucidating why the internet's inbuilt urge to achieve crowd-pleasing consensus has done the opposite, polarising western societies. America's political split is caused by, he says, conformism. \"Facebook has created two hive minds each residing in an ecosystem that nurtures head-nodding agreement and penalises dissenting views. A hive mind is an intellectually incapacitated one, with diminishing ability to sort fact from fiction, with a bias toward evidence that confirms the party line.\" We pick a tribe and conform to it, and cannot break free enough to even empathise with another.</p><p>Foer's solutions to all this are largely regulatory, technical and American, and might not terribly interest British readers. His main concession to a British edition is a foreword that, I must confess, gave me the hump. In it, he suggests that the British press was once a great national strength \"like France's wine or Switzerland's timepieces\", but that it has terribly declined over the past 20 years (ie while I've been working in it). As it happens, I think he's wrong, or not wholly right. Newspapers in the 1990s could be every bit as crap as they sometimes manage to be today.</p><p>Still, his book comes as a rousing recommendation of a subscription model newspaper that avoids the competitive ravages of virality. You're reading one.

IBM went a step further and stopped the development of the technology altogether.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No other company or entity, however, is taking the high moral ground on facial technology. The use of facial recognition by governments around the world has become quite prevalent. China has used it enforce quarantine in Beijing[1]\u00a0and to crack down on protestors in Hong Kong.[2]\u00a0Dubai's Ooyun project uses facial recognition for smart policing.[3]\u00a0Russia has used it against protestors[4]\u00a0as well as to track citizens' movements during the coronavirus lockdown.[5]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is now so prevalent that ordinary citizens know that they are being watched from all angles, public and private. For example, even when Facebook prompts a name to be tagged in a photo, it uses facial recognition algorithm to determine their presence in an image.</p><p>Facial recognition technology analyses facial images and interprets the identity of a person. The surface and features of a face are broken down into several data points to derive the output, with the precision of a plastic surgeon. For instance, the distance between the nose and lips; the width and breadth of a lip; protrusion of cheek bones and several other such conditions are used. Facial recognition tech is an Artificial Intelligence driven system. This is because when two unequal entities such as one version of person's facial expression is compared to his many photos taken across different time intervals, the system makes an intelligent judgement on whether it matches with the person's face.</p><p>The source of a facial image can be both physical \u2013 such as street cameras \u2013 and digital, such as social media. The captured image is then compared with thousands of images collected in a database made out of social media profiles, photographs provided for social identification cards such as Social Security, driver's licenses, passport etc. Technology companies can scrape the internet for images and videos containing faces, group them and map them to a single person. More data helps to train the facial recognition algorithm better, as every feature and expression is captured. For instance, it can recognise both a straight face and a laughing image of the same person. The more posts that are uploaded on Instagram, the more the facial recognition algorithm learns about the face.</p><p>The primary purpose of this technology is authentication and identification of a person. Authentication of an individual is a one-to-one verification process where the authenticating agency knows what it is searching for. For instance, at an immigration counter, the face of a traveller is scanned against the face of the person who he claims to be in the system. Identification of an individual is a one-to-many process where the identifier does not know the person being searched, like the identification of a suspect within a database of criminals.</p><p>There are two categories of players in this game \u2013 big tech and social media companies and the State.</p><p>Being a tech and social media giant like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft is a huge advantage. Massive amounts of voluntary, in-coming facial images have created a global database. Facebook's facial recognition system known as DeepFace[6]\u00a0uses the tech to enrich the user experience on its platform. The rate of accuracy with which Facebook prompts the user with the name of the person in an image, has increased significantly over the years, and trained on large datasets of faces to reach an accuracy of 97.35% today.</p><p>Streaming services such as Amazon Prime Videoleverages an in-house Amazon product called X-Ray[7]\u00a0to help the viewer identify the celebrity of screen. It uses the movie cataloguing website IMDB, also owned by Amazon, as the backend database for this process.</p><p>Amazon sells its facial recognition software called, Rekognition.[8]\u00a0Amazon Rekognition claims to identify objects, people, scenes. It can also detect emotions such as happiness or sadness on people's faces.Microsoft provides an API (Application Programmig Interface) called Face,[9]\u00a0a re-usable code which can be downloaded by a customer for facial analysis. Age, emotion, pose, smile, facial hair and other features can be determined with Microsoft Face.</p><p>These companies have major customers: governments across the world.[10]\u00a0[11]\u00a0Their many agencies use facial recognition to provide government services and national security. The recent controversy surrounding police departments in the U.S using ClearviewAI software, a U.S. based surveillance company, to quell public protests,[12]\u00a0[13]\u00a0has brought to the forefront of the wide usage of such technology.</p><p>Facial recognition tech is a favourite policing tool because all current identification systems require close proximity between the person and the device. For instance, fingerprints require a person to touch a scanner; iris scanner, though contactless, requires a person to be near the scanner. Facial recognition allows identification from afar, eliminating the need for person-device proximity.</p><p>This gives the state unprecedented power over its citizens. The virtuous use of tracking and identifying criminals can easily convert into profiling citizens taking part in protests. For this very reason, the Chinese government banned the use of masks in the Hong Kong protest.[14]\u00a0It's easier to pick protestors once their facial image from a protest is captured and mapped against a database of citizen's photos.</p><p>This problem multiplies manifold when the tech companies and government are intertwined. The Chinese government uses Face++ a product from Megvii,[15]\u00a0a Facial recognition AI software company based in Beijing. Other Chinese companies such as Yitu[16]\u00a0and SenseTime[17]\u00a0also produce this tech which can be easily used for mass surveillance. China is accused of using this technology for the religious profiling of its Uighur population.[18]\u00a0The fear of such abuse has resulted in many states in the U.S. such as Californiato ban this technology in police body cameras.[19]\u00a0Regional bodies like the European Union are still debating whether to adopt this technology[20]\u00a0or not.</p><p>Others are moving ahead. Russian courts in March 2020[21]\u00a0have struck down a challenge to the use of facial recognition tech.[22]\u00a0[23]\u00a0Malaysia, Uganda, Zimbabwe have tied up with Chinese companies to implement facial recognition.[24]\u00a0India's National Crime Records Bureau plans to implement a country wide automated facial recognition system (AFRS). It has released a tender for proposals from tech companies for it.[25]</p><p>The technology has still not been perfected, though. A major challenge is the problem of misidentification, especially for women and individuals with darker skin tone. For instance, Amazon's Rekognition falsely identified 28 non-white U.S. lawmakers as criminals. A study by MIT and Microsoft found an error rate of 35% for darker skinned women.[26]\u00a0[27]</p><p>The fear of a dystopian world is legitimate, especially if the technology is not fool-proof. Though facial images are considered sensitive biometric data as per Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and India's Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, these regulations exempt government agencies from their purview, on grounds of public safety and national security. India needs to be particularly careful because it is a heterogenous country, with varied ethnicities and facial types. Till the technology matures, facial recognition should be used only as a medium of screening individuals, along with other identity verification methods.</p><p>*About the author: Sagnik

IBM went a step further and stopped the development of the technology altogether.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No other company or entity, however, is taking the high moral ground on facial technology. The use of facial recognition by governments around the world has become quite prevalent. China has used it enforce quarantine in Beijing[1]\u00a0and to crack down on protestors in Hong Kong.[2]\u00a0Dubai's Ooyun project uses facial recognition for smart policing.[3]\u00a0Russia has used it against protestors[4]\u00a0as well as to track citizens' movements during the coronavirus lockdown.[5]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is now so prevalent that ordinary citizens know that they are being watched from all angles, public and private.\u00a0 For example, even when Facebook prompts a name to be tagged in a photo, it uses facial recognition algorithm to determine their presence in an image.</p><p>Facial recognition technology analyses facial images and interprets the identity of a person. The surface and features of a face are broken down into several data points to derive the output, with the precision of a plastic surgeon. For instance, the distance between the nose and lips; the width and breadth of a lip; protrusion of cheek bones and several other such conditions are used. Facial recognition tech is an Artificial Intelligence driven system. This is because when two unequal entities such as one version of person's facial expression is compared to his many photos taken across different time intervals, the system makes an intelligent judgement on whether it matches with the person's face.</p><p>The source of a facial image can be both physical \u2013 such as street cameras \u2013 and digital, such as social media. The captured image is then compared with thousands of images collected in a database made out of social media profiles, photographs provided for social identification cards such as Social Security, driver's licenses, passport etc. Technology companies can scrape the internet for images and videos containing faces, group them and map them to a single person. More data helps to train the facial recognition algorithm better, as every feature and expression is captured. For instance, it can recognise both a straight face and a laughing image of the same person. The more posts that are uploaded on Instagram, the more the facial recognition algorithm learns about the face.</p><p>The primary purpose of this technology is authentication and identification of a person. Authentication of an individual is a one-to-one verification process where the authenticating agency knows what it is searching for. For instance, at an immigration counter, the face of a traveller is scanned against the face of the person who he claims to be in the system. Identification of an individual is a one-to-many process where the identifier does not know the person being searched, like the identification of a suspect within a<br/><br/>database of criminals.</p><p>There are two categories of players in this game \u2013 big tech and social media companies and the State.</p><p>Being a tech and social media giant like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft is a huge advantage. Massive amounts of voluntary, in-coming facial images have created a global database. Facebook's facial recognition system known as DeepFace[6]\u00a0uses the tech to enrich the user experience on its platform. The rate of accuracy with which Facebook prompts the user with the name of the person in an image, has increased significantly over the years, and trained on large datasets of faces to reach an accuracy of 97.35% today.</p><p>Streaming services such as Amazon Prime Videoleverages an in-house Amazon product called X-Ray[7]\u00a0to help the viewer identify the celebrity of screen. It uses the movie cataloguing website IMDB, also owned by Amazon, as the backend database for this process.</p><p>Amazon sells its facial recognition software called, Rekognition.[8]\u00a0Amazon Rekognition claims to identify objects, people, scenes. It can also detect emotions such as happiness or sadness on people's faces.Microsoft provides an API (Application Programmig Interface) called Face,[9]\u00a0a re-usable code which can be downloaded by a customer for facial analysis. Age, emotion, pose, smile, facial hair and other features can be determined with Microsoft Face.</p><p>These companies have major customers: governments across the world.[10]\u00a0[11]\u00a0Their many agencies use facial recognition to provide government services and national security. The recent controversy surrounding police departments in the U.S using ClearviewAI software, a U.S. based surveillance company, to quell public protests,[12]\u00a0[13]\u00a0has brought to the forefront of the wide usage of such technology.</p><p>Facial recognition tech is a favourite policing tool because all current identification systems require close proximity between the person and the device. For instance, fingerprints require a person to touch a scanner; iris scanner, though contactless, requires a person to be near the scanner. Facial recognition allows identification from afar, eliminating the need for person-device proximity.</p><p>This gives the state unprecedented power over its citizens. The virtuous use of tracking and identifying criminals can easily convert into profiling citizens taking part in protests. For this very reason, the Chinese government banned the use of masks in the Hong Kong protest.[14]\u00a0It's easier to pick protestors once their facial image from a protest is captured and mapped against a database of citizen's photos.</p><p>This problem multiplies manifold when the tech companies and government are intertwined. The Chinese government uses Face++ a product from Megvii,[15]\u00a0a Facial recognition AI software company based in Beijing. Other Chinese companies such as Yitu[16]\u00a0and SenseTime[17]\u00a0also produce this tech which can be easily used for mass surveillance. China is accused of using this technology for the religious profiling of its Uighur population.[18]\u00a0The fear of such abuse has resulted in many states in the U.S. such as Californiato ban this technology in police body cameras.[19]\u00a0Regional bodies like the European Union are still debating whether to adopt this technology[20]\u00a0or not.</p><p>Others are moving ahead. Russian courts in March 2020[21]\u00a0have struck down a challenge to the use of facial recognition tech.[22]\u00a0[23]\u00a0Malaysia, Uganda, Zimbabwe have tied up with Chinese companies to implement facial recognition.[24]\u00a0India's National Crime Records Bureau plans to implement a country wide automated facial recognition system (AFRS). It has released a tender for proposals from tech companies for it.[25]</p><p>The technology has still not been perfected, though. A major challenge is the problem of misidentification, especially for women and individuals with darker skin tone. For instance, Amazon's Rekognition falsely identified 28 non-white U.S. lawmakers as criminals. A study by MIT and Microsoft found an error rate of 35% for darker skinned women.[26]\u00a0[27]</p><p>The fear of a dystopian world is legitimate, especially if the technology is not fool-proof. Though facial images are considered sensitive biometric data as per Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and India's Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, these regulations exempt government agencies from their purview, on grounds of public safety and national security. India needs to be particularly careful because it is a heterogenous country, with varied ethnicities and facial types.\u00a0 Till the technology matures, facial recognition should be used only as a medium of screening individuals, along with other identity verification methods.</p><p>*About the author: Sagnik Chakraborty\u00a0is Researcher,\u00a0Cybersecurity Studies, and Manager, Management

However, sentiment provided the key factor in how share prices performed. In short, those sectors seen as most vulnerable to the disruption created by a messy Brexit took a hit, and discounts to net asset value (NAV) widened accordingly, even in sectors such as primary healthcare where the Brexit question is largely irrelevant.Retail and urban logistics performed as we expected, although the number of retailers seeking protection through company voluntary arrangements was worryingly high. Some retail landlords have yet to wake up to the trend towards e-commerce, or at least have left it too late. Troubled landlord Intu (INTU) was given a lifeline after a bid from Hammerson, but that turned sour and shares in Intu ended the year down 25 per cent. Conversely, the big-box landlords such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Tritax Big Box</url> (BBOX) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">LondonMetric</url> (LMP) benefited from ever-increasing demand for warehouse space, although this didn't stop Tritax's share price from taking a hit.Much as we pointed out last year, life in the London office market continued to prosper, giving a clear signal that the idea that a rush for the exit would devastate the market was just plain wrong. The landlords did react, however, with speculative projects being wound down, which ironically will help to support rents as supply dries up. Outside London, the big catch-up continues, with cities such as Manchester and Leeds really buzzing. Office space has also been reduced through use of permitted development rights, which allows it to be converted to residential use.And the residential side continues to change. Institutional funds have found a conduit into the build-to-rent sector in an attempt to generate a decent return at a time when gilt-edged stock yields remain nominal, or in some cases negative, when adjusted for inflation. For the likes of east-London-focused builder       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Telford Homes</url> (TEF) this capital-light model, whereby the build schemes are forward funded by the institutional landlord, has formed a growing part of the business model.The Brexit poison even managed to permeate the healthcare sector, with the three quoted primary healthcare centre providers,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Primary Health Properties</url> (PHP),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Assura</url> (AGR) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">MedicXFund</url> (MXF), all losing ground on their share prices despite being one of the most defensive boltholes in the real estate market.Brexit doesn't stop people getting older and seeking medical attention, and modern healthcare centres are a key factor in helping to take pressure off A&amp;E units. And the vast majority of the rental income generated is paid for indirectly by HM Treasury. Rent reviews are starting to show open-market rents moving higher, while other rents are linked to inflation. Student accommodation provided one of the bright spots as share prices in companies such as on Unite (UTG) finished up on the year, with demand for quality student digs expected to continue. JCFAANGs finally fumbleWe were perhaps hasty when we suggested investors should approach super hot US tech with caution ('      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Fear the FAANGs</url>', March). For the first half of 2018, these five US giants - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - drivers of the longest bull run in history and widely heralded symbols of success in corporate America - looked unstoppable.Apple and Amazon smashed through the hotly anticipated $1 trillion market capitalisation barrier after reporting solid second-quarter earnings in August. At that point, Amazon's share price had risen more than 75 per cent since the start of the year, second only (among the five FAANGs) to Netflix, which was up 202 per cent.Even Facebook and Alphabet, which had been targeted by European regulators for several months, were shrugging off concerns. Between 27 March and 25 July - while Mark Zuckerberg was attempting to explain to global governments why the personal data of 50m Facebook users had been mined by Cambridge Analytica for political activity - his company's share price climbed 42 per cent.But as the heat of the summer began to fade and global stock markets started to get the jitters, our March concerns were vindicated. By November, the share prices of all five of the FAANG companies had fallen more than 20 per cent from their peaks, losing the equivalent value of half the FTSE 100 index.  In the past few months, a shift in sentiment has made investors far less forgiving of mistakes. Netflix shares were hammered when the online streaming group missed expectations for subscriber growth over the summer. Facebook has finally succumbed to a negative regulatory outlook, which also seems to be hurting its daily user count. In mid October, Alphabet and Amazon - long-time stalwarts of impressive revenue growth - reported that they had failed to hit top-line expectations, and Apple's omission of sales volumes has been widely interpreted as a sign that the world has finally reached peak iPhone. Even with the recent share price fall, investors who buy shares in Amazon today are betting on eye-watering levels of multi-decade growth in profits Macroeconomic volatility seems to have put an end to (or at least paused) a strong period of market growth. And if that is the case, the FAANG stocks simply look too expensive to keep attracting investment. Even with the recent share price fall, investors who buy shares in Amazon today are betting on eye-watering levels of multi-decade growth in profits.That feeds into the second fear flagged in our March feature: that big tech has been a major beneficiary of passive momentum. That's fine during the good times and further inflows are a given. But in indices weighted according to market value, the share of overvalued stocks is likely to decline if sentiment turns and the markets begin to fall. According to JPMorgan flows strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the worst recent sell-offs occurred when equity exchange traded funds (ETFs) suffered the biggest outflows. We're not at that stage yet, but it's worth being wary that the tide is turning on a wonderful few years of growth. Investors who looked at the FAANGs as stalwarts of growth and momentum should (still) proceed with caution. MBBanks held back by geopolitical tumultEarlier this year the valuation gap between shares in UK-listed banking giants and their challengers had narrowed considerably. After almost a decade of being punished by investors for a litany of provisions and impairments that culled profitability, share valuations for the big five major banks began rising. Meanwhile, those of alternative lenders - which had traditionally traded at a substantial premium thanks to a track record of delivering high returns on equity, solid loan book growth and decent dividend yields - began to be priced for lower growth. Against this backdrop ('      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">The Banks Strike Back</url>', April), we questioned whether this reversal in ratings was deserved and was likely to continue in the longer term.In fact, geopolitical events and subsequent concerns around the outlook for the global economy have overtaken the underlying operating performance of both sets of lenders. For domestically focused lenders such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Lloyds</url> (LLOY),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Barclays</url> (BARC) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Royal Bank of Scotland</url> (RBS), fears of a Brexit-induced worsening in the UK economy and ensuing rise in loan defaults have left shares in all three trading at near-12-month lows. Alternative lenders such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">OneSavings Bank</url> (OSB) - which specialise in buy-to-let mortgages and asset finance - have not escaped that downturn in confidence. Meanwhile the ongoing US-China trade spat and slowdown in Chinese economic and credit growth have had a similar effect on the valuations of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Standard Chartered</url> (STAN) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">HSBC</url> (HSBA).     That bearishness is understandable given geopolitical uncertainty, but it belies a relatively solid performance by lenders big and small. RBS returned to paying dividends for the first time in a decade after settling with the US Department of Justice over alleged historic mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities, while improving returns on equity and regulatory capital levels meant Standard Chartered also recommenced dividend payments. There were also glimmers of hope for Barclays' investment banking operations, which had dragged down the group's return on equity. Pre-tax profits here were up 9 per cent during the first nine months of the year and the return on average allocated tangible equity rose to 9.6 per cent from 8.4 per cent in the prior year.  However, margin pressures remain across the sector. For larger banks, pain has come from an increasingly competitive mortgage market and the gradual run-off of higher-yielding back books. Meanwhile, alternative lenders have continued to limit the amount of asset and motor finance business they write. That has borne fruit for those with the biggest exposure to those markets -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Close Brothers</url>' (CBG) net interest margin has stabilised at 8 per cent, while       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Secure Trust's</url> (STB) cost of risk (impairment losses as a percentage of the loan book) reduced to 1.9 per cent during the first half, from 2.5 per cent in the prior year. For now, impairment levels remain benign for both sets of lenders, but that could change if predictions of a slowdown in global growth prove well-founded. EPSpeculative capitalWhat happens when one throws all traditional investment criteria out of the window? We tested this approach ('      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Sink or swim</url>', June), and tried to identify Alternative Investment Market (Aim) stocks with high-growth potential but which might have been eliminated via a normal vetting process.We devised a new, counterintuitive form of analysis - looking for businesses with zero, or low, revenues; those for which analysts expected huge revenue growth; and those operating in particularly niche fields.Then we considered the pros and cons of a number of stocks within these categories. Could they really achieve their anticipated heights? Given the enhanced risk arguably tied to these small-caps, we eschewed our typical 'buy', 'hold' and 'sell' stamps - instead employing the terms 'sink' and 'swim'.Two of those companies highlighted the risks of a definitive call either way, and just how unpredictable  'all-or-nothing' investments can be.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Xeros</url> (XSG), a developer of polymer beads and associated technologies for the commercial laundry and tannery industries, reducing the water and energy used in cleaning processes, was a case in point, and one stock we thought would swim. We recognised the company's lack of full commercialisation, and the possibility it might need more cash, but concluded that its market opportunity looked significant, especially amidst heightening global concerns around water shortages.Xeros's half-year results to June revealed an 81 per cent rise in revenues to \u00a31.87m, helped by sales of commercial laundry machines in hotels and lodgings. Service income also more than doubled. Meanwhile, joint house broker Berenberg noted that domestic laundry is \"where the value is\", estimating that the addressable market here is worth over \u00a32.8bn in annual royalty fees worldwide. But the slide has been inexorable, and notwithstanding recent agreements signed, the shares are now down over 90 per cent in the year to date. Tuesday 27 November saw a major decline on the news of a proposed placing and open offer to raise around \u00a320m at a deeply discounted price.Conversely, our doubts over       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">OptiBiotix</url> (OPTI) - a developer of compounds to modify the human microbiome's response to certain diseases - proved overly sceptical. At the time, we were concerned by house broker FinnCap's lack of future financial estimates, and analyst comments that the early-stage nature of OptiBiotix's contracts made it \"difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty\". However, the group successfully raised cash in May, implying shareholder enthusiasm. But we perceived the potential for diversification, with OptiBiotix having various specialist tech platforms. It had already floated       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">SkinBioTherapeutics</url> (SBTX) separately, retaining a stake.Half a year on, and 2018 can be said to have been a success. OptiBiotix has signed 18 agreements this year, including a US manufacturing and supply deal with US Pharma Lab Inc - which the company says gives it strategic access to the world's largest probiotic market. It has also created another wholly owned subsidiary, ProBiotix, which could ultimately list. We're still wary about the absence of forecasts and, on that basis, wouldn't buy into OptiBiotix at this stage. But for current shareholders with high risk thresholds, it could be interesting to hang on as OptiBiotix pursues its transition from development to commercialisation. The shares are up around 30 per cent in the year to date. HC There are some signs that a previously super-hot US economy could slow in the coming year The contrarian takeDid it pay to be hedged in the second half of 2018? Six months ago ('      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">How to be a contrarian</url>', June), we walked readers through several bearish investing strategies, all of which explored ways of reducing overall portfolio risk. It's early days, but the results have been encouraging thus far.The first was a medium-term bet against US equities. Our thinking - that an already overvalued share market could suffer once the sugar rush of the Trump administration's massive tax cut faded - has not yet come to pass. But there are some signs that a previously super-hot US economy could slow in the coming year: capital spending is slowing, and projections for consumer spending are thinning. Some of these nerves were probably reflected in October's sell-off, which has left the S&amp;P 500 index slightly down since June.Second, we argued that China's staggering debt levels could ultimately lead to pressure on the renminbi. Ultimately, an export-focused nation such as China is not averse to its currency weakening, but what matters to foreign exchange traders is the rate at which currencies move relative to one another. And for the renminbi, the currency that matters most is its chief competitor, the US dollar.So far, the short yuan/long dollar trade we highlighted has worked, whether or not it is China's indebtedness that has moved the market, or the ever-strengthening greenback. In fact, the renminbi is 9 per cent down on the dollar since our feature.The third call was a bullish long-term view on gold, which we highlighted for its strong track record as a hedge in a multi-polar multi-currency financial system. Over the past 25 years, gold has outperformed all major currencies, and it is that sort of timeframe we see as appropriate for the yellow metal, particularly in its raw commodity form. Since June, gold has held up in sterling terms, but drifted in its most-followed denomination - the US dollar - largely thanks to the availability of higher-yielding 'risk-free' assets.A bullish call on grain prices has also gone sideways, although it's hard to imagine this remaining the case indefinitely. As a recent report by the InterAcademy Partnership made clear, the global food system looks set to struggle to mitigate the increasingly dire effects of climate change and water insecurity, and all that implies for crop yields.In short, it is probably too early to say too much about most of our calls. But that doesn't mean contrarian takes need years to pay off. As part of the feature, we also compiled a list of London's 10 most-shorted stocks at the time, based on fund disclosures of any short position equivalent to at least 0.5 per cent of a company's market capitalisation. Although the bearish calls had been volatile in the year to June, the mini-portfolio has been largely vindicated in the months since.On average, the stocks have shed 19 per cent of their value in the half-year since we wrote the piece, with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Debenhams</url> (DEB) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Restaurant Group</url> (RTN) shedding 70 and 53 per cent, respectively.

ANA reliable betIn May, the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), leaving it up to individual states to set their own rules on sports betting. Since writing about the ruling shortly after it was made ('Gambling's American dream', June), UK gambling companies have been eager to take advantage of the new frontier of US sports betting, teaming up with American operators rather than cracking the market individually. These opportunities have become ever more important for the UK bookies as gambling regulations in the UK have tightened. And just as we thought, the UK bookies clearly believe in the American dream.For       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">GVC</url> (GVC) chief executive Kenny Alexander, the repeal of PASPA will make the US the world's biggest regulated market for gambling within five years. His company has wasted no time swooping in on the US market, signing a 50:50 joint venture with MGM resorts in August. The partnership will combine MGM's brand and multi-state licences with GVC's technology; each will invest an initial $100m (\u00a379.2m) to create an industry-leading sports betting and online gambling platform.Not to be overshadowed,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">William Hill</url> (WMH) signed a deal with casino group Eldorado Resorts for digital- and land-based sports betting and online gaming across Eldorado's 21 properties across 11 states. The partnership initially gives William Hill access to 23m US customers, a number that is likely to increase once Eldorado completes the acquisition of Tropicana Entertainment.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Paddy Power Betfair</url> (PPB) has had a tougher time breaking into the US market. It completed the acquisition of US fantasy sports website FanDuel in July, but losses are now expected in the second half due to the seasonality of fantasy sports. Management had expected the deal to be immediately earnings accretive.Meanwhile, the UK bookies are bracing for the impact of the stake cut on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. The cut comes into effect in April 2019, and is expected to shrink cash profits at GVC's UK retail division by around 15per cent.William Hill was forced to impair the value of its UK retail assets by a mammoth \u00a3883m as a result of the FOBT decision. It's estimated that total net gaming revenue could fall by between 35 per cent and 45 per cent, while adjusted operating profits could drop by anything between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m, and could prompt up to 900 shop closures.And on top of the FOBT stake change, the bookies will also soon face an increase in offshore gaming duty. At the time of our feature, we speculated that this tax could be increased to make up forsome of the lost taxes from FOBTs. Indeed, in the recent Budget Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an increase in the tax from 15 per cent to 21 per cent.This continued crackdown on gambling in the UK is likely to push the bookies to focus any global expansion plans even more heavily on the US. The dealmaking does not look set to slow down anytime soon. JF The Financial Conduct Authority, which doesn't regulate bitcoin but has authority over some cryptocurrency derivatives, has repeatedly issued warnings on scams </p><p>                     Why Bitcoin is on life support                   </p><p>Just over a year ago, we cautioned investors to be wary of bitcoin ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/shares/2018/12/13/light-up-your-investing-our-guide-to-the-market-in-2019/\">Bitcoin: gamble or gold mine?</url>'). Our warning came in November, and for another month or so our advice appeared to go unheeded.</p><p>The first half of December 2017 was the peak time to be a 'HODLer', as holders of bitcoin are known. In the preceding 12 months, the leading cryptocurrency had climbed an astounding 2,000 per cent in dollar terms. The lessons of the 17th century Dutch tulip mania, when a rush towards an extraordinary spike in tulip bulb prices was followed by an almighty crash, were quickly being unlearned.</p><p>And then remembered. The price of bitcoin now sags 82 per cent beneath its December 2017 peak. The situation is dire for many trusting observers, who were sold this worthless thread of computer code in exchange for their life savings. At least the tulip bulbs had some substance.</p><p>Diehard cryptofans believe that the decentralisation of currency and the end of fiat money is still inevitable. Used for years in the darkest corners of the internet to pay for drugs, hitmen and worse, cryptocurrencies will pave the way towards the democratisation of finance. There's still a pulse to bitcoin.</p><p>So, why is bitcoin on life support? Risk appetite has come down, according to Russ Mould, investment director at platform AJ Bell, owing to a tightening of monetary policies around the world and the subsequent reduction in liquidity levels.</p><p>This, he argues, has made investors more careful, and with \"less cheap cash around\", bitcoin took a dive. Bitcoin could rally next year, he added, \"if the markets push back sufficiently on the US Federal Reserve, and the Fed bottles it\".</p><p>As with most revolutions, factions emerged. In this case, thousands. Bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21m, has been undermined by rival cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, which 'forked' off. Initial coin offerings (ICOs), which launch new cryptos, were banned in 2017 in China and South Korea. The Financial Conduct Authority, which doesn't regulate bitcoin but has authority over some cryptocurrency derivatives, has repeatedly issued warnings on scams.</p><p>Given the zeal of bitcoin's supporters, its decline and fall might have appeared funny to those watching from the sidelines. But reports of believers who sunk their life savings into bitcoin render it a tragedy. Neither should one ignore the huge energy output needed to extract bitcoin; coal mining and oil drilling are dirty businesses with terrible environmental consequences, but at least the end products provide fuel. Bitcoin appears to have fuelled little but manic speculation.</p><p>The arrogant techno-punks who pumped this garbage to the general public won't be held to account. A rally is possible, but unlikely, and given the lack of regulation, we hope bitcoin goes away. Gold bars would've been a better investment for the buyers. Bars of another kind would be more suitable for the salesmen.

The IC companies team reviews cover features from 2018 In common with past years, our recent bumper Christmas edition looked at the state of investing in 2018, and what might be in store in 2019. We also ran the rule over our tips of the week in a year when bullishness appeared to run out of steam.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's important to be honest about how those tips performed, and how we can learn from their timing and analysis. But to focus only on binary market calls would downplay much of what the Investors Chronicle does, which often involves a lot more nuance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With this in mind, we are revisiting several of our recent cover features - from the FAANGs to property and bitcoin to banking - to test, review and update our thinking on the themes that caught our attention in 2018.</p><p>Well-forecasted Our fundamental take on what would happen in the real estate market in 2018 ('The property forecast', February) proved to be broadly spot on, assuming you live in the real world. However, sentiment provided the key factor in how share prices performed. In short, those sectors seen as most vulnerable to the disruption created by a messy Brexit took a hit, and discounts to net asset value (NAV) widened accordingly, even in sectors such as primary healthcare where the Brexit question is largely irrelevant.</p><p>Retail and urban logistics performed as we expected, although the number of retailers seeking protection through company voluntary arrangements was worryingly high. Some retail landlords have yet to wake up to the trend towards e-commerce, or at least have left it too late. Troubled landlord Intu (INTU) was given a lifeline after a bid from Hammerson, but that turned sour and shares in Intu ended the year down 25 per cent. Conversely, the big-box landlords such as Tritax Big Box (BBOX) and LondonMetric (LMP) benefited from ever-increasing demand for warehouse space, although this didn't stop Tritax's share price from taking a hit.</p><p>Much as we pointed out last year, life in the London office market continued to prosper, giving a clear signal that the idea that a rush for the exit would devastate the market was just plain wrong. The landlords did react, however, with speculative projects being wound down, which ironically will help to support rents as supply dries up. Outside London, the big catch-up continues, with cities such as Manchester and Leeds really buzzing. Office space has also been reduced through use of permitted development rights, which allows it to be converted to residential use.</p><p>And the residential side continues to change. Institutional funds have found a conduit into the build-to-rent sector in an attempt to generate a decent return at a time when gilt-edged stock yields remain nominal, or in some cases negative, when adjusted for inflation. For the likes of east-Londonfocused builder Telford Homes (TEF) this capitallight model, whereby the build schemes are forward funded by the institutional landlord, has formed a growing part of the business model.</p><p>The Brexit poison even managed to permeate the healthcare sector, with the three quoted primary healthcare centre providers, Primary Health Properties (PHP), Assura (AGR) and MedicXFund (MXF), all losing ground on their share prices despite being one of the most defensive boltholes in the real estate market.</p><p>Brexit doesn't stop people getting older and seeking medical attention, and modern healthcare centres are a key factor in helping to take pressure offA&amp;E units. And the vast majority of the rental income generated is paid for indirectly by HM Treasury. Rent reviews are starting to show open-market rents moving higher, while other rents are linked to inflation. Student accommodation provided one of the bright spots as share prices in companies such as on Unite (UTG) finished up on the year, with demand for quality student digs expected to continue. JC_ FAANGs finally fumble We were perhaps hasty when we suggested investors should approach super hot US tech with caution ('Fear the FAANGs', March). For the first half of 2018, these five US giants - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - drivers of the longest bull run in history and widely heralded symbols of success in corporate America - looked unstoppable.</p><p>'Even with the recent share price fall, investors who buy shares in Amazon today are betting on eye-watering levels of multidecade growth in profits' Apple and Amazon smashed through the hotly anticipated $1 trillion market capitalisation barrier after reporting solid second-quarter earnings in August. At that point, Amazon's share price had risen more than 75 per cent since the start of the year, second only (among the five FAANGs) to Netflix, which was up 202 per cent.</p><p>Even Facebook and Alphabet, which had been targeted by European regulators for several months, were shrugging offconcerns. Between 27 March and 25 July - while Mark Zuckerberg was attempting to explain to global governments why the personal data of 50m Facebook users had been mined by Cambridge Analytica for political activity - his company's share price climbed 42 per cent.</p><p>But as the heat of the summer began to fade and global stock markets started to get the jitters, our March concerns were vindicated. By November, the share prices of all five of the FAANG companies had fallen more than 20 per cent from their peaks, losing the equivalent value of half the FTSE 100 index.</p><p>In the past few months, a shift in sentiment has made investors far less forgiving of mistakes. Netflix shares were hammered when the online streaming group missed expectations for subscriber growth over the summer. Facebook has finally succumbed to a negative regulatory outlook, which also seems to be hurting its daily user count. In mid October, Alphabet and Amazon - long-time stalwarts of impressive revenue growth - reported that they had failed to hit top-line expectations, and Apple's omission of sales volumes has been widely interpreted as a sign that the world has finally reached peak iPhone.</p><p>Macroeconomic volatility seems to have put an end to (or at least paused) a strong period of market growth. And if that is the case, the FAANG stocks simply look too expensive to keep attracting investment. Even with the recent share price fall, investors who buy shares in Amazon today are betting on eyewatering levels of multi-decade growth in profits. That feeds into the second fear flagged in our March feature: that big tech has been a major beneficiary of passive momentum. That's fine during the good times and further inflows are a given. But in indices weighted according to market value, the share of overvalued stocks is likely to decline if sentiment turns and the markets begin to fall. According to JPMorgan flows strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the worst recent sell-offs occurred when equity exchange traded funds (ETFs) suffered the biggest outflows. We're not at that stage yet, but it's worth being wary that the tide is turning on a wonderful few years of growth. Investors who looked at the FAANGs as stalwarts of growth and momentum should (still) proceed with caution. MB Banks held back by geopolitical tumult Earlier this year the valuation gap between shares in UK-listed banking giants and their challengers had narrowed considerably. After almost a decade of being punished by investors for a litany of provisions and impairments that culled profitability, share valuations for the big five major banks began rising. Meanwhile, those of alternative lenders - which had traditionally traded at a substantial premium thanks to a track record of delivering high returns on equity, solid loan book growth and decent dividend yields - began to be priced for lower growth. Against this backdrop ('The Banks Strike Back', April), we questioned whether this reversal in ratings was deserved and was likely to continue in the longer term.</p><p>In fact, geopolitical events and subsequent concerns around the outlook for the global economy have overtaken the underlying operating performance of both sets of lenders. For domestically focused lenders such as Lloyds (LLOY), Barclays (BARC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), fears of a Brexitinduced worsening in the UK economy and ensuing rise in loan defaults have left shares in all three trading at near-12-month lows. Alternative lenders such as OneSavings Bank (OSB) - which specialise in buy-to-let mortgages and asset finance - have not escaped that downturn in confidence. Meanwhile the ongoing US-China trade spat and slowdown in Chinese economic and credit growth have had a similar effect on the valuations of Standard Chartered (STAN) and HSBC (HSBA).</p><p>That bearishness is understandable given geopolitical uncertainty, but it belies a relatively solid performance by lenders big and small. RBS returned to paying dividends for the first time in a decade after settling with the US Department of Justice over alleged historic mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities, while improving returns on equity and regulatory capital levels meant Standard Chartered also recommenced dividend payments. There were also glimmers of hope for Barclays' investment banking operations, which had dragged down the group's return on equity. Pre-tax profits here were up 9 per cent during the first nine months of the year and the return on average allocated tangible equity rose to 9.6 per cent from 8.4 per cent in the prior year.</p><p>However, margin pressures remain across the sector. For larger banks, pain has come from an increasingly competitive mortgage market and the gradual run-offof higher-yielding back books. Meanwhile, alternative lenders have continued to limit the amount of asset and motor finance business they write. That has borne fruit for those with the biggest exposure to those markets - Close Brothers' (CBG) net interest margin has stabilised at 8 per cent, while Secure Trust's (STB) cost of risk (impairment losses as a percentage of the loan book) reduced to 1.9 per cent during the first half, from 2.5 per cent in the prior year. For now, impairment levels remain benign for both sets of lenders, but that could change if predictions of a slowdown in global growth prove well-founded. EP Speculative capital What happens when one throws all traditional investment criteria out of the window? We tested this approach ('Sink or swim', June), and tried to identify Alternative Investment Market (Aim) stocks with high-growth potential but which might have been eliminated via a normal vetting process.</p><p>We devised a new, counterintuitive form of analysis - looking for businesses with zero, or low, revenues; those for which analysts expected huge revenue growth; and those operating in particularly niche fields.</p><p>Then we considered the pros and cons of a number of stocks within these categories. Could they really achieve their anticipated heights? Given the enhanced risk arguably tied to these small-caps, we eschewed our typical 'buy', 'hold' and 'sell' stamps - instead employing the terms 'sink' and 'swim'.</p><p>Two of those companies highlighted the risks of a definitive call either way, and just how unpredictable 'all-or-nothing' investments can be.</p><p>Xeros (XSG), a developer of polymer beads and associated technologies for the commercial laundry and tannery industries, reducing the water and energy used in cleaning processes, was a case in point, and one stock we thought would swim. We recognised the company's lack of full commercialisation, and the possibility it might need more cash, but concluded that its market opportunity looked significant, especially amidst heightening global concerns around water shortages.</p><p>Xeros's half-year results to June revealed an 81 per cent rise in revenues to \u00a31.87m, helped by sales of commercial laundry machines in hotels and lodgings. Service income also more than doubled. Meanwhile, joint house broker Berenberg noted that domestic laundry is \"where the value is\", estimating that the addressable market here is worth over \u00a32.8bn in annual royalty fees worldwide. But the slide has been inexorable, and notwithstanding recent agreements signed, the shares are now down over 90 per cent in the year to date. Tuesday 27 November saw a major decline on the news of a proposed placing and open offer to raise around \u00a320m at a deeply discounted price.</p><p>Conversely, our doubts over OptiBiotix (OPTI) - a developer of compounds to modify the human microbiome's response to certain diseases - proved overly sceptical. At the time, we were concerned by house broker FinnCap's lack of future financial estimates, and analyst comments that the early-stage nature of OptiBiotix's contracts made it \"difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty\". However, the group successfully raised cash in May, implying shareholder enthusiasm. But we perceived the potential for diversification, with OptiBiotix having various specialist tech platforms. It had already floated SkinBioTherapeutics (SBTX) separately, retaining a stake.</p><p>'There are some signs that a previously super-hot US economy could slow in the coming year' Half a year on, and 2018 can be said to have been a success. OptiBiotix has signed 18 agreements this year, including a US manufacturing and supply deal with US Pharma Lab Inc - which the company says gives it strategic access to the world's largest probiotic market. It has also created another wholly owned subsidiary, ProBiotix, which could ultimately list. We're still wary about the absence of forecasts and, on that basis, wouldn't buy into OptiBiotix at this stage. But for current shareholders with high risk thresholds, it could be interesting to hang on as OptiBiotix pursues its transition from development to commercialisation. The shares are up around 30 per cent in the year to date. HC The contrarian take Did it pay to be hedged in the second half of 2018? Six months ago ('How to be a contrarian', June), we walked readers through several bearish investing strategies, all of which explored ways of reducing overall portfolio risk. It's early days, but the results have been encouraging thus far.</p><p>The first was a medium-term bet against US equities. Our thinking - that an already overvalued share market could suffer once the sugar rush of the Trump administration's massive tax cut faded - has not yet come to pass. But there are some signs that a previously super-hot US economy could slow in the coming year: capital spending is slowing, and projections for consumer spending are thinning. Some of these nerves were probably reflected in October's sell-off, which has left the S&amp;P 500 index slightly down since June.</p><p>Second, we argued that China's staggering debt levels could ultimately lead to pressure on the renminbi. Ultimately, an export-focused nation such as China is not averse to its currency weakening, but what matters to foreign exchange traders is the rate at which currencies move relative to one another. And for the renminbi, the currency that matters most is its chief competitor, the US dollar.</p><p>So far, the short yuan/long dollar trade we highlighted has worked, whether or not it is China's indebtedness that has moved the market, or the ever-strengthening greenback. In fact, the renminbi is 9 per cent down on the dollar since our feature.</p><p>The third call was a bullish long-term view on gold, which we highlighted for its strong track record as a hedge in a multi-polar multi-currency financial system. Over the past 25 years, gold has outperformed all major currencies, and it is that sort of timeframe we see as appropriate for the yellow metal, particularly in its raw commodity form. Since June, gold has held up in sterling terms, but drifted in its most-followed denomination - the US dollar - largely thanks to the availability of higher-yielding 'risk-free' assets.</p><p>A bullish call on grain prices has also gone sideways, although it's hard to imagine this remaining the case indefinitely. As a recent report by the InterAcademy Partnership made clear, the global food system looks set to struggle to mitigate the increasingly dire effects of climate change and water insecurity, and all that implies for crop yields.</p><p>In short, it is probably too early to say too much about most of our calls. But that doesn't mean contrarian takes need years to pay off. As part of the feature, we also compiled a list of London's 10 most-shorted stocks at the time, based on fund disclosures of any short position equivalent to at least 0.5 per cent of a company's market capitalisation. Although the bearish calls had been volatile in the year to June, the mini-portfolio has been largely vindicated in the months since.</p><p>On average, the stocks have shed 19 per cent of their value in the half-year since we wrote the piece, with Debenhams (DEB) and Restaurant Group (RTN) shedding 70 and 53 per cent, respectively. Only three of the companies - Marks and Spencer (MKS), Greencore (GNC) and Aggreko (AGK) - saw their share prices rise, and then only by single digits. Investors in construction firm Kier Group (KIE), now at the top of the most-shorted list, should take note. AN A reliable bet In May, the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), leaving it up to individual states to set their own rules on sports betting. Since writing about the ruling shortly after it was made ('Gambling's American dream', June), UK gambling companies have been eager to take advantage of the new frontier of US sports betting, teaming up with American operators rather than cracking the market individually. These opportunities have become ever more important for the UK bookies as gambling regulations in the UK have tightened. And just as we thought, the UK bookies clearly believe in the American dream.</p><p>For GVC (GVC) chief executive Kenny Alexander, the repeal of PASPA will make the US the world's biggest regulated market for gambling within five years. His company has wasted no time swooping in on the US market, signing a 50:50 joint venture with MGM resorts in August. The partnership will combine MGM's brand and multi-state licences with GVC's technology; each will invest an initial $100m (\u00a379.2m) to create an industry-leading sports betting and online gambling platform.</p><p>Not to be overshadowed, William Hill (WMH) signed a deal with casino group Eldorado Resorts for digital-and land-based sports betting and online gaming across Eldorado's 21 properties across 11 states. The partnership initially gives William Hill access to 23m US customers, a number that is likely to increase once Eldorado completes the acquisition of Tropicana Entertainment.</p><p>Paddy Power Betfair (PPB) has had a tougher time breaking into the US market. It completed the acquisition of US fantasy sports website FanDuel in July, but losses are now expected in the second half due to the seasonality of fantasy sports. Management had expected the deal to be immediately earnings accretive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK bookies are bracing for the impact of the stake cut on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. The cut comes into effect in April 2019, and is expected to shrink cash profits at GVC's UK retail division by around 15 per cent.</p><p>William Hill was forced to impair the value of its UK retail assets by a mammoth \u00a3883m as a result of the FOBT decision. It's estimated that total net gaming revenue could fall by between 35 per cent and 45 per cent, while adjusted operating profits could drop by anything between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m, and could prompt up to 900 shop closures.</p><p>And on top of the FOBT stake change, the bookies will also soon face an increase in offshore gaming duty. At the time of our feature, we speculated that this tax could be increased to make up for some of the lost taxes from FOBTs. Indeed, in the recent Budget Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an increase in the tax from 15 per cent to 21 per cent.</p><p>This continued crackdown on gambling in the UK is likely to push the bookies to focus any global expansion plans even more heavily on the US. The dealmaking does not look set to slow down anytime soon. JF Why Bitcoin is on life support Just over a year ago, we cautioned investors to be wary of bitcoin ('Bitcoin: gamble or gold mine?'). Our warning came in November, and for another month or so our advice appeared to go unheeded.</p><p>The first half of December 2017 was the peak time to be a 'HODLer', as holders of bitcoin are known. In the preceding 12 months, the leading cryptocurrency had climbed an astounding 2,000 per cent in dollar terms. The lessons of the 17th century Dutch tulip mania, when a rush towards an extraordinary spike in tulip bulb prices was followed by an almighty crash, were quickly being unlearned.</p><p>And then remembered. The price of bitcoin now sags 82 per cent beneath its December 2017 peak. The situation is dire for many trusting observers, who were sold this worthless thread of computer code in exchange for their life savings. At least the tulip bulbs had some substance.</p><p>Diehard cryptofans believe that the decentralisation of currency and the end of fiat money is still inevitable. Used for years in the darkest corners of the internet to pay for drugs, hitmen and worse, cryptocurrencies will pave the way towards the democratisation of finance. There's still a pulse to bitcoin. So, why is bitcoin on life support? Risk appetite has come down, according to Russ Mould, investment director at platform AJ Bell, owing to a tightening of monetary policies around the world and the subsequent reduction in liquidity levels.</p><p>This, he argues, has made investors more careful, and with \"less cheap cash around\", bitcoin took a dive. Bitcoin could rally next year, he added, \"if the markets push back sufficiently on the US Federal Reserve, and the Fed bottles it\".</p><p>As with most revolutions, factions emerged. In this case, thousands. Bitcoin, whose supply is capped at 21m, has been undermined by rival cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, which 'forked' off. Initial coin offerings (ICOs), which launch new cryptos, were banned in 2017 in China and South Korea. The Financial Conduct Authority, which doesn't regulate bitcoin but has authority over some cryptocurrency derivatives, has repeatedly issued warnings on scams.</p><p>Given the zeal of bitcoin's supporters, its decline and fall might have appeared funny to those watching from the sidelines. But reports of believers who sunk their life savings into bitcoin render it a tragedy. Neither should one ignore the huge energy output needed to extract bitcoin; coal mining and oil drilling are dirty businesses with terrible environmental consequences, but at least the end products provide fuel. Bitcoin appears to have fuelled little but manic speculation.</p><p>The arrogant techno-punks who pumped this garbage to the general public won't be held to account. A rally is possible, but unlikely, and given the lack of regulation, we hope bitcoin goes away. Gold bars would've been a better investment for the buyers. Bars of another kind would be more suitable for the salesmen.

We are completely different.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Revolut, headquartered in London, was only founded three years ago; it now has over 3 million customers in Europe, a number that has doubled over the past nine months.</p><p>The neobank is attracting 7000 new customers each day, and expects this will be 10,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In April it secured $US250 million in fresh venture capital funding for global expansion, at a valuation of $US1.7 billion. It's the fastest-growing unicorn tech company in Europe.</p><p>And according to its website, Revolut is about to land down under. Ominously for the major banks, without any advertising, 20,000 Australians have already signed up to its waiting list.</p><p>Revolut expects to have a prepaid debit card live in the Australian market by the end of the year. It will launch in the new year and is targeting 150,000 local users by the end of 2019. It's also taking on New Zealand, part of an ambitious plan to also capture Millennial customers in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p><p>Mr West reckons timing for the Australian launch is solid. The loss of trust in the big four banks on the back of the Hayne commission should help it lure customers away from the incumbents, he says.</p><p>\"When we launch in Australia, our main goal is to be an alternative to traditional banks. We are very anti-bank, and people have really resonated with that,\" Mr West says in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial Review from London, ahead of an appearance at the Intersekt Festival in Melbourne on October 29, where he is delivering a keynote address.</p><p>Revolut's arrival will also worry other budding neobanks in Australia, such as Volt, Xinja and 86 400, which are also trying to lure Millennials away from the big four. The rise of \"challenger banks\" will be discussed at this week's Sibos conference in Sydney.</p><p>Revolut has already secured the necessary licensing in Australia for its payments cards by piggybacking off an AFSL licence held by an existing bank that Mr West declined to name.</p><p>It plans to use the new start-up bank licensing regime established by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and become an \"authorised deposit-taking institution\" (ADI), which would allow it to take deposits.</p><p>Revolut built up its big customer numbers in Europe by providing an ultra-low-cost foreign exchange options for travellers. Its cards have no fees for overseas withdrawals and transfers, and exchange rates are the same banks get in wholesale markets. This will also be the case in Australia.</p><p>Revolut was also able to scale because its banking application was better than those offered by the British and European incumbents - something that will be harder in Australia, given the big tech investment by the majors on their banking applications.</p><p>Mr West agrees Australian banks \"are certainly better than UK banks and most European banks\". But he adds \"they are still nothing special\".</p><p>\"None of them are offering the real, in-depth analytics we are offering on spending, none are even close on the FX spreads, none of them have an app designed as beautifully as ours.\"</p><p>Revolut has aspirations to become the \"Amazon of finance\". Pressed to explain, Mr West says customers don't want half-a-dozen apps on their phone managing different elements of their financial life. \"They want to have everything centralised in one brand they know that they trust.</p><p>\"Customer are becoming lazy and expecting more from the services they use. I don't want my bank to bombard me with offers. I want to give my bank my criteria and to give me one solution right to me that matches my criteria.\"</p><p>The philosophy of Revolut is more tech than fin. \"We are a tech company first and foremost. We are redefining banking on a global scale,\" he says.</p><p>Like Netflix and Spotify, Revolut is pushing towards a subscription-based model: it has 150,000 customers paying \u00a36.99 a month; and 80,000 paying \u00a312.99 a month. These include all-you-can-eat insurance deals, personal concierges and cashback offers. Like Uber and Amazon, Revolut has no plans to become profitable any time soon.</p><p>Mr West says Revolut doesn't consider banks its main competition - rather, it will come from Facebook and Amazon \"when they inevitably break into finance\". Oozing confidence, he says \"with our capital, brand awareness and unique style marketing, we won't struggle to win the Australian market over\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc72f1wps3o9hasenphka</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ4-1F51-JD34-V2N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I am David Westin.  When Donald Trump was  first elected people said that the tech industry would not be one of the  beneficiaries but the market have said otherwise with the tech up over 17  percent since the election as this chart shows with us now is someone who  knows just a little bit about tech and about Washington.  Steve Case was  Co-founder and CEO of AOL and he now owns his venture capital firm on  Washington, D.C., it's called Revolution.  Also still with us is Shawn  Golhar of Barclays.  So Steve, welcome to -- back to Bloomberg.  Good to  have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASE:  Good to be with you, David.</p><p>WESTIN:  Which is it?  Is Donald Trump and more importantly his agenda  good for the tech industry or bad for the tech industry?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I guess it's a mixed bag and I think it's still early in  the process.  There are some things that are obviously have been welcome.   There has been a Trump rally, getting a sense of maybe a less regulation  would be helpful to the sector, a new proposed impact is maybe helpful to  the sector.  At the same time, there are some areas that have great concern  to tech industry and to me and including some of the issues around  immigration.</p><p>How do we make sure we continue to win what's now our global battle  for talent or there's too much focus I think on building walls and we need  to also focus on continuing to be a magnet for talent?  Things like the  startup these provision or the international entrepreneur where we'll need  to be part of that.  So I think it's a -- it's a mixed bag there.  There  has been no question, the Trump rally now it's, sort of -- trump reality  sets in where it's a little more difficult to get things done whether it's  health care or tax reform as he -- as he is acknowledging in recent weeks.</p><p>WESTIN:  Well, to pick up on tax reform for a while.  How important is  that in the tech industry?  Suppose there was a fairly substantial tech --  tax reform package that went through, how much would that affect your  business?</p><p>CASE:  It really depends on which side of the tech industry.  A lot of  the tax reform debate is on things like repatriation or done overall lower,  you know, tax rate and repatriation really is an issue for the big, you  know, global fortune 500 companies.  If you focus on the startup sector,  they care more about things, like, you know, capital gains incentives and  so one of the things that was introduced on a bipartisan way last year, the  Investing in Opportunity Act encouraged more venture capital to go to these  regions we call the rise of the rest regions to fund the entrepreneurs in  those other places.</p><p>Last year, 80 percent of venture capital went to just three states,  California, New York, and Massachusetts.  We need a level of playing field,  so everybody everywhere has a shot of the American Dream.  It should be  front and center, the Trump agenda because that's obviously part of the  reason you got elected.  A lot of people around the country do feel, sort  of, left out and left behind.  We need to back the entrepreneurs in those  places so the tax reform can just be focused on simple vacation or what the  big companies want.</p><p>It also needs to be focused on really encouraging, putting the right  incentives in place around startups which you drive the job growth and do  that all across the country and not just in a few places like Silicon  Valley.</p><p>WESTIN:  Shawn, I want to ask you, Shawn Golhar of Barclays.  To what  extent is the tech rally because of Donald Trump and what extent is it  despite Donald Trump because some people say it's gone up because it's one  of the sectors that's reasonably insulated from some of the Trump  initiatives.</p><p>GOLHAR:  Well, I think that repatriation play is really what's driving  a lot of this.  I think people are very excited.  Whenever you see the tech  entrepreneurs and leadership come meet with the president or meet with the  White House, this seems to be an agenda item high up on the list.  And  we're still learning this.  Like, you mentioned before, we're only in a  hundred days of the new administration.  The tax reform debate is just  starting.</p><p>We have a long way to go, so I think for technology companies they're  still pretty excited we can get some big corporate tax deals done.  The  immigration issue that he mentioned I think is exactly spot on.  I don't  think they're playing up as much in the market perception of it.  I don't  see investors asking as much about that in terms of supply of labor coming  in but I do think CEOs and tech founders are really worried about it.</p><p>WESTIN:  So Steve, what about that repatriation?  That looms large  with at least the big tech companies people like Apple.  We just saw the  report just say I think they have over $250 billion now on cash on their  balance sheet.  How critical is that?  How much of a difference would it  make to an Apple for example if they could just bring the cash home?  Do  they need it home?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think -- I think it does make sense to figure out some  way to get it home, but I think the repatriatism has to be tied with some  incentives to drive job creation and the last time there was repatriation  nearly two decades ago, that didn't really happen.  They are figuring out  ways to try to get that money back and get an investing and the next  generation of companies that are going to create jobs all across the  country, it should be a priority.  I'd also say some of tech rally has  been, some of these companies you mentioned, Apple, also Amazon, and others  have been reporting, you know, strong earnings and so the fundamentals of  these well, particularly the large tech companies have been pretty sound  and obviously that's driving a lot of the market as well.</p><p>FERRO:  Steve, if they want to tie in sense to bring it home.  What is  the actual incentive to bring it home in the following sense that they're  already using the money to buy back stock?  Apple announced the 50-billion  buyback just yesterday, so clearly they've got access to cash for the  government.  Is it about getting them to use that money to invest or a one- off payment to boost the books and pad things out a little bit?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think it's both.  I think there wouldn't be some, kind  of, one-time payment.  There would be necessary because there are a lot of  initiatives that obviously are funded and a lot of pay for is that people  are looking for as part of any, kind of, tax reform package but in addition  to that, I do think there needs to be the right mechanism and the right  incentives so some of that repatriated capital does go back into investing  in this next generation of startups.</p><p>Particularly in this Rise of the Rest cities and there are -- you  know, there's things like the investing and opportunity act is exactly the,  kind of, thing that needs to be looked at as part of an overall tax reform  package.  There is too much focus on tax reform in terms of what's  interested to the big companies.  We need to also focus on what the whole  startup sector which really is where the future is going to be, where this  whole third wave is going to be, you know, fought.</p><p>How do we back the next generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to  revolutionize health care, education, energy, food, agriculture, and doing  it not just in California and New York, but in Ohio and Kansas?  That has  to be a focus of the administration and it should be a focus of the whole  tax reform debate.  More than has been so far.</p><p>FERRO:  Shawn Golhar?</p><p>GOLHAR:  Yes, and I think that's -- it's really interested.  I think  the idea of using repatriated money to pay for buybacks or executive  compensation it's not really politically tenable in my view.  I think it's  a hot potato to go down that path.  I think what the congress will end up  thinking about at least wanting to do is something like a repatriation for  infrastructure.  Repatriation for a, you know, Create Jobs in America Act  or something.  You saw previous congress talk about this.  You're seeing  the current congress and administration, kind of, toy with that idea and I  think that's low hanging fruit to get a deal done.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes, but Shawn, low hanging fruit to get a deal done, is  anyone actually going to bring the money home to do that?</p><p>GOLHAR:  You could make it mandatory in a sense that you're going to  be taxed on this no matter what.</p><p>FERRO:  Oh.</p><p>GOLHAR:  And you can make it -- you know, I can see from a political  perspective.  You know, you're going into midterm elections, it's a really  good argument to go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Look, I went out  there and I brought back the $2 trillion that I promised to do in campaign  trail.</p><p>FERRO:  You're saying they can force companies to bring their money  home and tax it.</p><p>GOLHAR:  They could tax that amount and it's up to the company to do  whatever they want to do.  This is the one-time opportunity and they could  get it.  Congress can do a lot of things like this.</p><p>WESTIN:  It's a bold proposal, bold proposal.  So Steve, before I let  you go , I do have to ask you, one thing has been in the news, Twitter has  been in the news quite a bit because they've announced a series of  partnerships on videos, streaming video on their servicing including with  Bloomberg.  We're going to be part -- one of the partners providing to  them.  Obviously, mobile video is where it is right now in the tech  industry.  Is this, sort of, thing -- something that could really bring  back Twitter?  Is this the way to go?</p><p>CASE:  I think -- I think Twitter has done a great job of trying to  position for the future.  I mean, it's a great platform.

I am David Westin. When <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was first elected people said that the tech industry would not be one of the beneficiaries but the market have said otherwise with the tech up over 17 percent since the election as this chart shows with us now is someone who knows just a little bit about tech and about Washington. <person><nameText>Steve Case </nameText></person>was Co-founder and CEO of AOL and he now owns his venture capital firm on Washington, D.C., it's called Revolution. Also still with us is Shawn Golhar of Barclays. So Steve, welcome to -- back to Bloomberg. Good to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASE: Good to be with you, David.</p><p>WESTIN: Which is it? Is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and more importantly his agenda good for the tech industry or bad for the tech industry?</p><p>CASE: Well, I guess it's a mixed bag and I think it's still early in the process. There are some things that are obviously have been welcome. There has been a Trump rally, getting a sense of maybe a less regulation would be helpful to the sector, a new proposed impact is maybe helpful to the sector. At the same time, there are some areas that have great concern to tech industry and to me and including some of the issues around immigration.</p><p>How do we make sure we continue to win what's now our global battle for talent or there's too much focus I think on building walls and we need to also focus on continuing to be a magnet for talent? Things like the startup these provision or the international entrepreneur where we'll need to be part of that. So I think it's a -- it's a mixed bag there. There has been no question, the Trump rally now it's, sort of -- trump reality sets in where it's a little more difficult to get things done whether it's health care or tax reform as he -- as he is acknowledging in recent weeks.</p><p>WESTIN: Well, to pick up on tax reform for a while. How important is that in the tech industry? Suppose there was a fairly substantial tech -- tax reform package that went through, how much would that affect your business?</p><p>CASE: It really depends on which side of the tech industry. A lot of the tax reform debate is on things like repatriation or done overall lower, you know, tax rate and repatriation really is an issue for the big, you know, global fortune 500 companies. If you focus on the startup sector, they care more about things, like, you know, capital gains incentives and so one of the things that was introduced on a bipartisan way last year, the Investing in Opportunity Act encouraged more venture capital to go to these regions we call the rise of the rest regions to fund the entrepreneurs in those other places.</p><p>Last year, 80 percent of venture capital went to just three states, California, New York, and Massachusetts. We need a level of playing field, so everybody everywhere has a shot of the American Dream. It should be front and center, the Trump agenda because that's obviously part of the reason you got elected. A lot of people around the country do feel, sort of, left out and left behind. We need to back the entrepreneurs in those places so the tax reform can just be focused on simple vacation or what the big companies want.</p><p>It also needs to be focused on really encouraging, putting the right incentives in place around startups which you drive the job growth and do that all across the country and not just in a few places like Silicon Valley.</p><p>WESTIN: Shawn, I want to ask you, Shawn Golhar of Barclays. To what extent is the tech rally because of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and what extent is it despite <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>because some people say it's gone up because it's one of the sectors that's reasonably insulated from some of the Trump initiatives.</p><p>GOLHAR: Well, I think that repatriation play is really what's driving a lot of this. I think people are very excited. Whenever you see the tech entrepreneurs and leadership come meet with the president or meet with the White House, this seems to be an agenda item high up on the list. And we're still learning this. Like, you mentioned before, we're only in a hundred days of the new administration. The tax reform debate is just starting.</p><p>We have a long way to go, so I think for technology companies they're still pretty excited we can get some big corporate tax deals done. The immigration issue that he mentioned I think is exactly spot on. I don't think they're playing up as much in the market perception of it. I don't see investors asking as much about that in terms of supply of labor coming in but I do think CEOs and tech founders are really worried about it.</p><p>WESTIN: So Steve, what about that repatriation? That looms large with at least the big tech companies people like Apple. We just saw the report just say I think they have over $250 billion now on cash on their balance sheet. How critical is that? How much of a difference would it make to an Apple for example if they could just bring the cash home? Do they need it home?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think -- I think it does make sense to figure out some way to get it home, but I think the repatriatism has to be tied with some incentives to drive job creation and the last time there was repatriation nearly two decades ago, that didn't really happen. They are figuring out ways to try to get that money back and get an investing and the next generation of companies that are going to create jobs all across the country, it should be a priority. I'd also say some of tech rally has been, some of these companies you mentioned, Apple, also Amazon, and others have been reporting, you know, strong earnings and so the fundamentals of these well, particularly the large tech companies have been pretty sound and obviously that's driving a lot of the market as well.</p><p>FERRO: Steve, if they want to tie in sense to bring it home. What is the actual incentive to bring it home in the following sense that they're already using the money to buy back stock? Apple announced the 50-billion buyback just yesterday, so clearly they've got access to cash for the government. Is it about getting them to use that money to invest or a one- off payment to boost the books and pad things out a little bit?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think it's both. I think there wouldn't be some, kind of, one-time payment. There would be necessary because there are a lot of initiatives that obviously are funded and a lot of pay for is that people are looking for as part of any, kind of, tax reform package but in addition to that, I do think there needs to be the right mechanism and the right incentives so some of that repatriated capital does go back into investing in this next generation of startups.</p><p>Particularly in this Rise of the Rest cities and there are -- you know, there's things like the investing and opportunity act is exactly the, kind of, thing that needs to be looked at as part of an overall tax reform package. There is too much focus on tax reform in terms of what's interested to the big companies. We need to also focus on what the whole startup sector which really is where the future is going to be, where this whole third wave is going to be, you know, fought.</p><p>How do we back the next generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to revolutionize health care, education, energy, food, agriculture, and doing it not just in California and New York, but in Ohio and Kansas? That has to be a focus of the administration and it should be a focus of the whole tax reform debate. More than has been so far.</p><p>FERRO: Shawn Golhar?</p><p>GOLHAR: Yes, and I think that's -- it's really interested. I think the idea of using repatriated money to pay for buybacks or executive compensation it's not really politically tenable in my view. I think it's a hot potato to go down that path. I think what the congress will end up thinking about at least wanting to do is something like a repatriation for infrastructure. Repatriation for a, you know, Create Jobs in America Act or something. You saw previous congress talk about this. You're seeing the current congress and administration, kind of, toy with that idea and I think that's low hanging fruit to get a deal done.</p><p>FERRO: Yes, but Shawn, low hanging fruit to get a deal done, is anyone actually going to bring the money home to do that?</p><p>GOLHAR: You could make it mandatory in a sense that you're going to be taxed on this no matter what.</p><p>FERRO: Oh.</p><p>GOLHAR: And you can make it -- you know, I can see from a political perspective. You know, you're going into midterm elections, it's a really good argument to go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Look, I went out there and I brought back the $2 trillion that I promised to do in campaign trail.</p><p>FERRO: You're saying they can force companies to bring their money home and tax it.</p><p>GOLHAR: They could tax that amount and it's up to the company to do whatever they want to do. This is the one-time opportunity and they could get it. Congress can do a lot of things like this.</p><p>WESTIN: It's a bold proposal, bold proposal. So Steve, before I let you go , I do have to ask you, one thing has been in the news, Twitter has been in the news quite a bit because they've announced a series of partnerships on videos, streaming video on their servicing including with Bloomberg. We're going to be part -- one of the partners providing to them. Obviously, mobile video is where it is right now in the tech industry. Is this, sort of, thing -- something that could really bring back Twitter? Is this the way to go?</p><p>CASE: I think -- I think Twitter has done a great job of trying to position for the future. I mean, it's a great platform. Obviously it didn't exist at all 10 years ago, has really become a major media distribution, you know, platform and people are now relying on people they follow to, sort, of curate the news for them. It started as, sort of, a social service and has become much more of a news distribution service and adding partnerships with Bloomberg and adding more video content, more real-time E-news is absolutely the kind of thing they should be focusing on.</p><p>WESTIN: <person><nameText>Steve Case, </nameText></person>the Revolution, you can see it down there, Bloomberg Breakaway. That's what that sign is behind in there. Steve, thank you so much for joining us and also Shawn Golhar of Barclays.

I am David Westin. When <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was first elected people said that the tech industry would not be one of the beneficiaries but the market have said otherwise with the tech up over 17 percent since the election as this chart shows with us now is someone who knows just a little bit about tech and about Washington. <person><nameText>Steve Case </nameText></person>was Co-founder and CEO of AOL and he now owns his venture capital firm on Washington, D.C., it's called Revolution. Also still with us is Shawn Golhar of Barclays. So Steve, welcome to -- back to Bloomberg. Good to have you here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASE: Good to be with you, David.</p><p>WESTIN: Which is it? Is <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and more importantly his agenda good for the tech industry or bad for the tech industry?</p><p>CASE: Well, I guess it's a mixed bag and I think it's still early in the process. There are some things that are obviously have been welcome. There has been a Trump rally, getting a sense of maybe a less regulation would be helpful to the sector, a new proposed impact is maybe helpful to the sector. At the same time, there are some areas that have great concern to tech industry and to me and including some of the issues around immigration.</p><p>How do we make sure we continue to win what's now our global battle for talent or there's too much focus I think on building walls and we need to also focus on continuing to be a magnet for talent? Things like the startup these provision or the international entrepreneur where we'll need to be part of that. So I think it's a -- it's a mixed bag there. There has been no question, the Trump rally now it's, sort of -- trump reality sets in where it's a little more difficult to get things done whether it's health care or tax reform as he -- as he is acknowledging in recent weeks.</p><p>WESTIN: Well, to pick up on tax reform for a while. How important is that in the tech industry? Suppose there was a fairly substantial tech -- tax reform package that went through, how much would that affect your business?</p><p>CASE: It really depends on which side of the tech industry. A lot of the tax reform debate is on things like repatriation or done overall lower, you know, tax rate and repatriation really is an issue for the big, you know, global fortune 500 companies. If you focus on the startup sector, they care more about things, like, you know, capital gains incentives and so one of the things that was introduced on a bipartisan way last year, the Investing in Opportunity Act encouraged more venture capital to go to these regions we call the rise of the rest regions to fund the entrepreneurs in those other places.</p><p>Last year, 80 percent of venture capital went to just three states, California, New York, and Massachusetts. We need a level of playing field, so everybody everywhere has a shot of the American Dream. It should be front and center, the Trump agenda because that's obviously part of the reason you got elected. A lot of people around the country do feel, sort of, left out and left behind. We need to back the entrepreneurs in those places so the tax reform can just be focused on simple vacation or what the big companies want.</p><p>It also needs to be focused on really encouraging, putting the right incentives in place around startups which you drive the job growth and do that all across the country and not just in a few places like Silicon Valley.</p><p>WESTIN: Shawn, I want to ask you, Shawn Golhar of Barclays. To what extent is the tech rally because of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and what extent is it despite <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>because some people say it's gone up because it's one of the sectors that's reasonably insulated from some of the Trump initiatives.</p><p>GOLHAR: Well, I think that repatriation play is really what's driving a lot of this. I think people are very excited. Whenever you see the tech entrepreneurs and leadership come meet with the president or meet with the White House, this seems to be an agenda item high up on the list. And we're still learning this. Like, you mentioned before, we're only in a hundred days of the new administration. The tax reform debate is just starting.</p><p>We have a long way to go, so I think for technology companies they're still pretty excited we can get some big corporate tax deals done. The immigration issue that he mentioned I think is exactly spot on. I don't think they're playing up as much in the market perception of it. I don't see investors asking as much about that in terms of supply of labor coming in but I do think CEOs and tech founders are really worried about it.</p><p>WESTIN: So Steve, what about that repatriation? That looms large with at least the big tech companies people like Apple. We just saw the report just say I think they have over $250 billion now on cash on their balance sheet. How critical is that? How much of a difference would it make to an Apple for example if they could just bring the cash home? Do they need it home?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think -- I think it does make sense to figure out some way to get it home, but I think the repatriatism has to be tied with some incentives to drive job creation and the last time there was repatriation nearly two decades ago, that didn't really happen. They are figuring out ways to try to get that money back and get an investing and the next generation of companies that are going to create jobs all across the country, it should be a priority. I'd also say some of tech rally has been, some of these companies you mentioned, Apple, also Amazon, and others have been reporting, you know, strong earnings and so the fundamentals of these well, particularly the large tech companies have been pretty sound and obviously that's driving a lot of the market as well.</p><p>FERRO: Steve, if they want to tie in sense to bring it home. What is the actual incentive to bring it home in the following sense that they're already using the money to buy back stock? Apple announced the 50-billion buyback just yesterday, so clearly they've got access to cash for the government. Is it about getting them to use that money to invest or a one- off payment to boost the books and pad things out a little bit?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think it's both. I think there wouldn't be some, kind of, one-time payment. There would be necessary because there are a lot of initiatives that obviously are funded and a lot of pay for is that people are looking for as part of any, kind of, tax reform package but in addition to that, I do think there needs to be the right mechanism and the right incentives so some of that repatriated capital does go back into investing in this next generation of startups.</p><p>Particularly in this Rise of the Rest cities and there are -- you know, there's things like the investing and opportunity act is exactly the, kind of, thing that needs to be looked at as part of an overall tax reform package. There is too much focus on tax reform in terms of what's interested to the big companies. We need to also focus on what the whole startup sector which really is where the future is going to be, where this whole third wave is going to be, you know, fought.</p><p>How do we back the next generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to revolutionize health care, education, energy, food, agriculture, and doing it not just in California and New York, but in Ohio and Kansas? That has to be a focus of the administration and it should be a focus of the whole tax reform debate. More than has been so far.</p><p>FERRO: Shawn Golhar?</p><p>GOLHAR: Yes, and I think that's -- it's really interested. I think the idea of using repatriated money to pay for buybacks or executive compensation it's not really politically tenable in my view. I think it's a hot potato to go down that path. I think what the congress will end up thinking about at least wanting to do is something like a repatriation for infrastructure. Repatriation for a, you know, Create Jobs in America Act or something. You saw previous congress talk about this. You're seeing the current congress and administration, kind of, toy with that idea and I think that's low hanging fruit to get a deal done.</p><p>FERRO: Yes, but Shawn, low hanging fruit to get a deal done, is anyone actually going to bring the money home to do that?</p><p>GOLHAR: You could make it mandatory in a sense that you're going to be taxed on this no matter what.</p><p>FERRO: Oh.</p><p>GOLHAR: And you can make it -- you know, I can see from a political perspective. You know, you're going into midterm elections, it's a really good argument to go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Look, I went out there and I brought back the $2 trillion that I promised to do in campaign trail.</p><p>FERRO: You're saying they can force companies to bring their money home and tax it.</p><p>GOLHAR: They could tax that amount and it's up to the company to do whatever they want to do. This is the one-time opportunity and they could get it. Congress can do a lot of things like this.</p><p>WESTIN: It's a bold proposal, bold proposal. So Steve, before I let you go , I do have to ask you, one thing has been in the news, Twitter has been in the news quite a bit because they've announced a series of partnerships on videos, streaming video on their servicing including with Bloomberg. We're going to be part -- one of the partners providing to them. Obviously, mobile video is where it is right now in the tech industry. Is this, sort of, thing -- something that could really bring back Twitter? Is this the way to go?</p><p>CASE: I think -- I think Twitter has done a great job of trying to position for the future. I mean, it's a great platform. Obviously it didn't exist at all 10 years ago, has really become a major media distribution, you know, platform and people are now relying on people they follow to, sort, of curate the news for them. It started as, sort of, a social service and has become much more of a news distribution service and adding partnerships with Bloomberg and adding more video content, more real-time E-news is absolutely the kind of thing they should be focusing on.</p><p>WESTIN: <person><nameText>Steve Case, </nameText></person>the Revolution, you can see it down there, Bloomberg Breakaway. That's what that sign is behind in there. Steve, thank you so much for joining us and also Shawn Golhar of Barclays.

It should be  front and center, the Trump agenda because that's obviously part of the  reason you got elected.  A lot of people around the country do feel, sort  of, left out and left behind.  We need to back the entrepreneurs in those  places so the tax reform can just be focused on simple vacation or what the  big companies want.</p><p>  It also needs to be focused on really encouraging, putting the right  incentives in place around startups which you drive the job growth and do  that all across the country and not just in a few places like Silicon  Valley.</p><p>  WESTIN:  Shawn, I want to ask you, Shawn Golhar of Barclays.  To what  extent is the tech rally because of Donald Trump and what extent is it  despite Donald Trump because some people say it's gone up because it's one  of the sectors that's reasonably insulated from some of the Trump  initiatives.</p><p>  GOLHAR:  Well, I think that repatriation play is really what's driving  a lot of this.  I think people are very excited.  Whenever you see the tech  entrepreneurs and leadership come meet with the president or meet with the  White House, this seems to be an agenda item high up on the list.  And  we're still learning this.  Like, you mentioned before, we're only in a  hundred days of the new administration.  The tax reform debate is just  starting.</p><p>  We have a long way to go, so I think for technology companies they're  still pretty excited we can get some big corporate tax deals done.  The  immigration issue that he mentioned I think is exactly spot on.  I don't  think they're playing up as much in the market perception of it.  I don't  see investors asking as much about that in terms of supply of labor coming  in but I do think CEOs and tech founders are really worried about it.</p><p>  WESTIN:  So Steve, what about that repatriation?  That looms large  with at least the big tech companies people like Apple.  We just saw the  report just say I think they have over $250 billion now on cash on their  balance sheet.  How critical is that?  How much of a difference would it  make to an Apple for example if they could just bring the cash home?  Do  they need it home?</p><p>  CASE:  Well, I think -- I think it does make sense to figure out some  way to get it home, but I think the repatriatism has to be tied with some  incentives to drive job creation and the last time there was repatriation  nearly two decades ago, that didn't really happen.  They are figuring out  ways to try to get that money back and get an investing and the next  generation of companies that are going to create jobs all across the  country, it should be a priority.  I'd also say some of tech rally has  been, some of these companies you mentioned, Apple, also Amazon, and others  have been reporting, you know, strong earnings and so the fundamentals of  these well, particularly the large tech companies have been pretty sound  and obviously that's driving a lot of the market as well.</p><p>  FERRO:  Steve, if they want to tie in sense to bring it home.  What is  the actual incentive to bring it home in the following sense that they're  already using the money to buy back stock?  Apple announced the 50-billion  buyback just yesterday, so clearly they've got access to cash for the  government.  Is it about getting them to use that money to invest or a one- off payment to boost the books and pad things out a little bit?</p><p>  CASE:  Well, I think it's both.  I think there wouldn't be some, kind  of, one-time payment.  There would be necessary because there are a lot of  initiatives that obviously are funded and a lot of pay for is that people  are looking for as part of any, kind of, tax reform package but in addition  to that, I do think there needs to be the right mechanism and the right  incentives so some of that repatriated capital does go back into investing  in this next generation of startups.</p><p>  Particularly in this Rise of the Rest cities and there are -- you  know, there's things like the investing and opportunity act is exactly the,  kind of, thing that needs to be looked at as part of an overall tax reform  package.  There is too much focus on tax reform in terms of what's  interested to the big companies.  We need to also focus on what the whole  startup sector which really is where the future is going to be, where this  whole third wave is going to be, you know, fought.</p><p>  How do we back the next generation of entrepreneurs that are trying to  revolutionize health care, education, energy, food, agriculture, and doing  it not just in California and New York, but in Ohio and Kansas?  That has  to be a focus of the administration and it should be a focus of the whole  tax reform debate.  More than has been so far.</p><p>  FERRO:  Shawn Golhar?</p><p>  GOLHAR:  Yes, and I think that's -- it's really interested.  I think  the idea of using repatriated money to pay for buybacks or executive  compensation it's not really politically tenable in my view.  I think it's  a hot potato to go down that path.  I think what the congress will end up  thinking about at least wanting to do is something like a repatriation for  infrastructure.  Repatriation for a, you know, Create Jobs in America Act  or something.  You saw previous congress talk about this.  You're seeing  the current congress and administration, kind of, toy with that idea and I  think that's low hanging fruit to get a deal done.</p><p>  FERRO:  Yes, but Shawn, low hanging fruit to get a deal done, is  anyone actually going to bring the money home to do that?</p><p>  GOLHAR:  You could make it mandatory in a sense that you're going to  be taxed on this no matter what.</p><p>  FERRO:  Oh.</p><p>  GOLHAR:  And you can make it -- you know, I can see from a political  perspective.  You know, you're going into midterm elections, it's a really  good argument to go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Look, I went out  there and I brought back the $2 trillion that I promised to do in campaign  trail.</p><p>  FERRO:  You're saying they can force companies to bring their money  home and tax it.</p><p>  GOLHAR:  They could tax that amount and it's up to the company to do  whatever they want to do.  This is the one-time opportunity and they could  get it.  Congress can do a lot of things like this.</p><p>  WESTIN:  It's a bold proposal, bold proposal.  So Steve, before I let  you go , I do have to ask you, one thing has been in the news, Twitter has  been in the news quite a bit because they've announced a series of  partnerships on videos, streaming video on their servicing including with  Bloomberg.  We're going to be part -- one of the partners providing to  them.  Obviously, mobile video is where it is right now in the tech  industry.  Is this, sort of, thing -- something that could really bring  back Twitter?  Is this the way to go?</p><p>  CASE:  I think -- I think Twitter has done a great job of trying to  position for the future.  I mean, it's a great platform.  Obviously it  didn't exist at all 10 years ago, has really become a major media  distribution, you know, platform and people are now relying on people they  follow to, sort, of curate the news for them.  It started as, sort of, a  social service and has become much more of a news distribution service and  adding partnerships with Bloomberg and adding more video content, more  real-time E-news is absolutely the kind of thing they should be focusing  on.</p><p>  WESTIN:  Steve Case, the Revolution, you can see it down there,  Bloomberg Breakaway.  That's what that sign is behind in there.  Steve,  thank you so much for joining us and also Shawn Golhar of Barclays.

Nowhere i...</p><p>It has been the fate of many regulatory agencies to find their harshest critics are those who were once their strongest champions. </p><p>Nowhere is this more true than for the European Banking Authority \u2014 and it has taken another serious hit over the departure of its executive director, Adam Farkas, to one of Europe\u2019s most powerful bank lobby groups.</p><p>The European Ombudsman Emily O\u2019Reilly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/835bba98-8af3-444b-87fd-4b14ba822783\"> ruled </url>on Monday that the EBA should have vetoed Mr Farkas\u2019s move this year to the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). O\u2019Reilly \u2014 who also found that the agency was slow to shut off Mr Farkas\u2019s access to confidential information \u2014 delivered her finding with a stinging broader critique.</p><p>\u201cThe EBA was created from the ashes of the 2008 financial crash \u2014 a crisis, in part, defined by regulatory failure and so-called \u2018regulatory capture\u2019 by the financial industry,\u201d said O\u2019Reilly, an independent authority tasked with probing complaints against the EU. \u201cIn allowing its former Executive Director to join a major financial lobby association, the EBA risked perpetuating one of the core regulatory problems it was created to fix.\u201d</p><p>It was a deeply uncomfortable moment for an agency spawned to be custodian of a single rule book for banks, stringent overseer of stress tests and watchdog of the watchdogs, with powers to overrule ineffective national regulators.</p><p>The Paris-based EBA said it would take Ms O\u2019Reilly\u2019s criticisms on board. It also defended its approach, saying it had imposed \u201ccommensurate and proportionate\u201d restrictions on Mr Farkas to limit potential conflicts of interest.<br/><br/>But Ms\u00a0O\u2019Reilly is far from alone in her critique of the agency. For all the diligent regulatory work it has done behind the scenes, it has drawn heavy criticism during several high-profile moments of public scrutiny.</p><p>The EBA\u2019s handling of the Farkas case drew the ire of the same campaign groups and civil society organisations that had placed trust in it to keep the banks in check. The European Parliament, one of its strongest supporters, called this year for Mr Farkas to be barred from meeting with EU officials for two years. MEPs also rejected the agency\u2019s proposed candidate to replace Mr Farkas, because he too had worked for AFME. <br/><br/>The gloss wore off the EBA quickly after its creation in 2011, when the first bank stress tests it organised were derided <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f638a80-ef6a-11e0-bc88-00144feab49a\"> as far too lenient</url>. Franco-Belgian bank Dexia emerged officially as one of the soundest financial institutions in Europe \u2014 only to collapse less than three months later.</p><p>When it emerged last year that the EBA had shelved a report that found breaches of union law in the poor supervision of Danske Bank, Brussels <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/377f4b60-698f-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\"> was livid</url>.<br/><br/>EU officials note that many of the problems stem from the EBA\u2019s governance. It is run by a supervisory board made up of the same national banking watchdogs it is supposed to oversee.<br/><br/>Attempts by Brussels to reform the agency and reinforce its full-time executive leadership have also been stymied by the same national governments who complain of its shortcomings.<br/><br/>A moment of truth looms. Valdis Dombrovskis, one of the EU commission\u2019s executive vice-presidents, opened consultations last week on whether the EBA or a new institution should take on centralised responsibilities for tackling money laundering in Europe.<br/><br/>Should the EU opt to go with the EBA, \u201csubstantial changes would be needed\u201d, Mr Dombrovskis       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27baed85-5b71-4744-8b68-67e7ae6f2825\"> told the Financial Times</url> last week.<br/><br/>\u201cWe consider that the weaknesses by and large stem from the current system of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need more effective governance, more effective decision-making mechanisms.\u201d<br/><br/>Few would argue with that.</p><p> ;\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/jimbrunsden\"> @jimbrunsden</url></p><p>Chart du jour: Russia\u2019s death toll</p><p><br/>Russia\u2019s national death toll from coronavirus could be 70 per cent higher than what the government\u2019s official data show, as the Kremlin struggles to curb the spread of Covid-19 despite a seven-week long lockdown.

In the United States, two agencies within the executive branch have the power to seek to break up a company: The Federal Trade Commission[2] (FTC), and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division[3]. That is why it is important that we research any entanglements undermining the FTC and DOJ Antitrust's commitment to serving the public interest[4]. For decades[5], these agencies have mostly sat back and allowed the American economy to consolidate[6], consolidate[7], consolidate[8]. But that might be changing. In June[9], reports swirled that the FTC and DOJ had begun investigating the so-called Big Four technology companies, with FTC looking into Amazon and Facebook while DoJ probes Apple and Google. The case for breaking up big tech has been growing for years. </p><p>Many onlookers compare the likes of Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Cook to Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, and Carnegie \u2014 barons of the Second Gilded Age. But just because there's a good case for action[10] never means that the federal government will take it, especially when Silicon Valley has built[11] an influence-peddling operation in Washington that may even surpass Wall Street's.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to bring an antitrust case comes down to a few key individuals across the two agencies. In the FTC, the final call will come from the Commissioners. There are five of them, three Republicans and two Democrats, who all assumed office within the last year. Amazon and Facebook will almost certainly try to directly influence the thinking of these Commissioners. Therefore, the public needs to know whether these decision-makers have taken meetings with either of these companies, in order to accurately judge each Commissioners' performance and interpret their ultimate vote. In the DOJ, only one man will make the final call on whether to bring cases against Apple or Google: Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. Notably, Delrahim has a history[12] with one of his subjects. In 2007, he helped shepherd Google's purchase of DoubleClick through the regulatory eyes of the FTC and DoJ, meaning he previously worked as exactly the sort of influencer who may now attempt to skew his own decision-making. DoubleClick was a particularly important acquisition for Google \u2014 it gave the company tools to expand into banner ads[13], and crucially, had developed some of the earliest behavioral advertising technology[14]. This was the foundation for today's targeted ads, which have helped Google to single-handedly control 38% of the online advertising market[15]. Delrahim's history with Google raises eyebrows. But he has been trying to counter any inference of a conflict of interest by adopting a public facing posture of independence, saying[16] 'We already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies. US antitrust law is flexible enough to be applied to markets old and new.' Still, just like the FTC Commissioners, it is important for the public to understand how Apple and Google may be attempting to sway Delrahim. That's why the Revolving Door Project has sent Freedom of Information Act requests for the administrative calendars of both Delrahim and each of the FTC Commissioners, starting from when each official assumed office. We'll also be using FOIA, as always, to follow how money and corruption grease the wheels of the American economy for industry's benefit. That's why we're requesting a list of attorneys and staffers who've departed the FTC over the last five years. We're curious how many ex-FTC attorneys have taken jobs working for the corporations they used to oversee. We've already identified one such case: Laura Berger, the former senior attorney at the FTC's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, who now works as LinkedIn's Head of Privacy for the Americas. That's why we're requesting copies of her official email correspondence with LinkedIn while she was on the FTC's payroll. And that's just the beginning \u2014 we will be filing several more FOIA in the coming weeks as we seek to uncover how and why corporate consolidation has reached current levels. If you have ideas for additional FOIA or other research topics, please do not hesitate to reach out at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. The public deserves to understand how Silicon Valley's influence machine impacts the policy choices that affect all of our digital lives. Whether or not the FTC or DOJ ultimately bring cases against any of these companies, simply seeing who these officials are meeting with will help onlookers assess their decisions. The voices in the ears of our top regulators inevitably affect their decision-making -- we at least deserve to know who those voices are.

It's amorphous or chameleon-like.\"</p><p>Sonnenreich also noted the way some tech platforms function reflects that the real commodity, for the companies, is the data that's gathered about the individual users.</p><p>\"Most of these services are either free or nominally priced in terms of cash,\" Sonnenreich said. \"It makes it hard for consumers to evaluate product A versus product B, when the cost is zero.</p><p>\"We all value our privacy ... but have to recognize that privacy is, in many ways, compromised by the digital world in which we live.\"</p><p>While state agencies ponder individual or collective next steps, federal law and rules enforcers are laying the groundwork for moving antitrust actions forward.</p><p>Under an agreement recently struck between the U.S. Department of Justice and the FTC, the agencies split potential investigative duties aimed at big tech platforms. Per the agreement, the DOJ now has authority over any potential antitrust investigation into Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple, while the FTC has oversight of Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Close behind that bifurcation, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee linked arms with Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Wednesday in announcing a July hearing at which a Senate subcommittee will have the opportunity to learn more about any pending, or active federal investigative actions targeting big tech on antitrust issues.</p><p>Lee noted concerns that splitting responsibilities between two agencies may not be the most efficient path forward.</p><p>\"As the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division are apparently poised to begin investigations into possible antitrust violations by the tech industry, I am interested to learn more about the conduct the agencies will examine and the resources they will require to carry out this mission,\" Lee said in a statement.</p><p>\"I also intend to explore how and why the agencies are splitting the review of these tech firms between the two agencies.</p><p>\"Given the similarity in competition issues involved, divvying up these investigations is sure to waste resources, split valuable expertise across the agencies, and likely result in divergent antitrust enforcement,\" Lee said.</p><p>Conn Carroll, Lee's spokesman, said his boss also stands behind state-level efforts to probe potential antitrust issues as they relate to big tech.</p><p>\"Sen. Lee believes state (attorneys general) should investigate all antitrust concerns but they should only prosecute meritorious cases,\" Carroll said.</p><p>Klobuchar underscored that her antitrust concerns go beyond big tech platforms.</p><p>\"In the wake of multiple reports that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission may finally be initiating antitrust investigations into the largest tech firms, it's critical that we and the American people have a good sense of what the agencies are actually doing to protect competition in this important part of our economy,\" Klobuchar said.</p><p>\"But it's not just about the tech industry. Protecting competition is vital to the future of every sector in our economy in every state across our country. The state lawsuit challenging the merger of two of the four nationwide cellphone carriers shows that.</p><p>\"We need antitrust enforcement that meets the demands of the 21st century economy and enforcement agencies that have the resources and the will to undertake aggressive enforcement whenever and wherever competition is under threat. I look forward to discussing these matters with agency leadership on July 23,\" she said.</p><p>Jason Oxman, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a tech advocacy group, responded Wednesday urging policymakers to \"avoid harmful unintended consequences\" as they consider antitrust questions.</p><p>\"Consumers have access to numerous tools to improve their lives, work, and society because of technology. The entrepreneurs that make up the tech industry are constantly innovating to promote the well-being of their customers and maintain the ability to create the technologies that individuals, businesses, and governments demand.</p><p>\"As policymakers and government officials explore the current state of competition in U.S. markets, it is critical that they recognize that antitrust law protects competition, not competitors, and avoid harmful unintended consequences, especially those that could hurt the American economy, stifle American companies' ability to innovate, and cede U.S. technological leadership.\"</p><p>The Information Technology Industry Council counts Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google among its member companies.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p><p>Twitter: DNTechHive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-44069991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB6-V4Y1-DY6J-M00Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] 2019 saw the S&amp;P register a 30% total return. In isolation, this looks like a banner year, and it sure was; however, when we take a step back and look at the market's two-year stack the reality is far more normal. Thus is the nature of markets: moves happen in lumps and one must zoom out to find some semblance of an orderly trend. Instead of thinking about the 30% return, we can look at the annualized return since the start of Q4 in 2018. From that lens, the S&amp;P has returned an annualized 10.82% since the first day of Q4 2018. This level of return is consistent with the long-term price trend of the index. </p><p>All that truly changed along the way was sentiment. Markets across the world looked awful heading into 2019, despite a brief reprieve that commenced promptly on Christmas Eve 2018. At one point, the S&amp;P was within one fifth of one percent of a #8216;Bear Market.#8217; Alas, those who live on proclamations such as #8216;this is the longest bull market in history#8217; can still make the claim because of a mere twenty basis points.[1] This is the second time in the Bull Market that started in March of 2009 where the S&amp;P came within one percent of hitting #8216;Bear Market#8217; territory (the first having been 2011's -19.4% peak to trough move). Just imagine how different today's narratives would be had things moved slightly further in the wrong direction one random afternoon. Labels, as such, are great for selling headlines but have little value for us investors[2]. Does the longevity of the Bull Market mean anything in and of itself? Had we registered a 20% correction in 2018 instead of a 19.8% correction would prognosticators bemoan the #8216;maturity#8217; of this Bull Market? Another common refrain is about how expensive stocks[3] look today. We concluded our end of 2018 introductory section with the following point that is worth repeating today: In the end, 2018 marks one of the biggest one-year declines in the forward P/E in the past few decades fueled by a combination of strong realized earnings growth and a decline in the stock market. Some of the earnings growth was the sugar rush from tax cuts, though a healthy amount was realized via higher revenue growth. While one might call the early 2018 levels #8216;the upper end of fair value,#8217; today is on the lower end of the fair value range. Yes, we have been below these levels, but they were in far different environments. This makes now a compelling time for long-term investors to put money to work.[2] While last year ended at the low-end of the valuation range, 2019 saw the pendulum swing back to the high side when looking just at the market's P/E (what we have lovingly called #8216;Mr. Market's mood indicator#8217; in the past). Even looking at P/Es can be a little misleading however, given the following visual which is especially helpful in contextualizing where things stand: <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-1.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-1.png</url> [3] Yes, when we look at traditional valuation metrics (like P/E), stocks do appear expensive on an absolute basis. However, pay attention to the bottom two lines in the above table for the one relative (in contrast to absolute) valuation metric: stocks are on the historically cheap end of the spectrum relative to the 10-year Treasury yield. Importantly, stocks are exactly in the middle of the long-term range with respect to #8216;free cash flow yield.#8217; The contrast between P/E ratios checking in at the 88th percentile and free cash flow yield at the 53rd percentile is one of the most interesting realities of markets today. This contrast speaks far more to the nature of today's leading businesses and the composition of earnings than it does what the market itself is doing. Over the past decade, companies like Circuit Cities, Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers, RadioShack and KB Home have been replaced in the S&amp;P by the likes of MasterCard, Intuitive Surgical, Salesforce, Booking and Blackrock. Is it any wonder that while earnings might appear lower on a per share basis overall that cash flows are much better? The S&amp;P is built to evolve with the times. As older industries struggle, shrink and inevitably perish they get replaced by the younger upstarts, with better growth dynamics and different business models. These compositional changes tend to happen gradually; however, the financial crisis accelerated the pace of change. Today we are witnessing the consequences.New Business Models, New OpportunitiesThe last time we called out a group of companies who shared similar traits was in our January 2016 commentary entitled #8216;Robust Networks for the Long Term.#8217;[4] We see something similar developing today. On the one hand, the market has been enthusiastic about new business models, rewarding them with rich valuations, while on the other hand, a certain subset of companies with distinct properties[4] seem neglected. Two kinds of companies stand out for stellar performance last year: Companies with no earnings and rapid growth. Companies with low growth, high free cash flow and high repurchase yield alongside perceived #8216;safety.#8217; In the middle is a third type of company that got left in the dust. In some respects, the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index holds many companies evincing these traits. In 2019, the composite as represented by the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (FDN) returned 19%, well less than the market's 30% returns. This index includes 40 holdings listed below:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-2.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-2.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-3.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-3.png</url> [5] Some of these companies have unique problems, while others are strong. By and large, the traits that bind these companies together beyond the #8216;internet#8217; being core to their business model are as follows: Descent though not other-worldly growth rates (think high single digits up to 20%) High and growing operating margins (&gt;15%) High free cash flow yield (the consolidated index boasts a 4.5% free cash flow yield, greater than the S&amp;P at 4.1%)[6] Over-capitalized balance sheets Taken all together, you have an index with faster growth than the market and lower valuations, operating in the new economy, yet with somewhat extreme underperformance. Clearly this space looks like fertile hunting grounds for investors with a growth at a reasonable price (GARP) bias. Several companies in the FDN ETF have been in our portfolios for years, though we added a few more of these kinds of companies in the last quarter (most are in the actual holdings list above, the exception we are adding boasts all of the same traits but cannot be included due to its low float). Here are the companies in alphabetical order: Alphabet (GOOGL) ANGI Homeservices (ANGI) Dropbox (DBX) eBay (EBAY) Grubhub (GRUB) PayPal (PYPL) Twitter (TWTR) For the remainder of this letter we will dive into four of these positions, two of which because they are new to our portfolio and two because they suffered especially poor returns in the fourth quarter, deserving some attention and reflection. ANGI: The House Isn't The Only Thing Getting Fixed Barry Diller and IAC have an incredible history of nurturing and growing companies who are digitizing the offline world including stalwarts like Ticketmaster, Match.com, and Expedia.[7] In 2004, IAC acquired[5] ServiceMagic before rebranding the company to HomeAdvisors in 2012. In May 2017, HomeAdvisor acquired Angie's List and the company (#8216;ANGI#8217;) was listed publicly with IAC retaining ownership of over 80% of the combined company. ANGI provides digital marketplaces for home services. It connects service providers (#8216;SP#8217;s) with homeowners in need of service requests (#8216;SR#8217;s). Each marketplace match performed by ANGI throughout the years has provided a datapoint for a price on a specific job in a specific geography. ANGI currently has the largest database for job pricing in the United States. Although ANGI was not initially sure what the benefits of this database would be, the company is now deploying this information to offer transparency and in some cases, a fixed, fair price for projects in 133 specific verticals in certain zip codes, leveraging a strong data moat into a unique offering for homeowners. ANGI's CEO William Ridenour explains: So one of the opportunities I see, and this is a huge area of concern for homeowners and consumers, be \u2014 the fear of not getting a fair price. And the difficult part is nobody knows what a fair price is. So we think that there's an opportunity to actually, as a brand and as a service, become this reference point for home services pricing, with the idea that before you buy, check to make sure you're getting a fair price, an easy, fast, digital way to see what you can get that service for.[8] This strategy is a key building block for ANGI's efforts to increase mobile app usage, create a fixed price booking platform, and ultimately increase the number of service requests per customer. As the product improves, customer loyalty improves, adding to ANGI's already lush cash flow generating capabilities. ANGI is currently investing significant cash flow into customer acquisition and earning slightly above a 10% free cash flow margin despite these considerable investments. If ANGI can use improved loyalty to migrate customers onto the mobile app and away from the rising toll Google charges for traffic, the company could generate considerable leverage on the over 50% of revenue it invests in sales in marketing (40% of that S&amp;M expense goes directly to customer acquisition). In addition to customer acquisition, sales and marketing investments are funding the growth of the SP network. As ANGI evolves from lead generation, to a managed marketplace, to a fixed price platform, the importance of growing SP supply only increases. ANGI currently has the largest supply of SPs in the market which creates a challenging barrier for competitors to overcome. A fixed price platform with price transparency should catalyze SP engagement since it would lower barriers for SPs to land jobs in a cost-effective, time-saving way. Platforms provide network effects as they grow, and network effects would grow margins meaningfully. Even if margins only expand by 200 basis points per year and sales growth is less than half of what management expects over the next five years, ANGI should be valued at $12.60 a share based on a DCF, 60% above the price at which we made ANGI a position in our portfolio independent of our holding in IAC. ANGI is at least a couple years away from an adoption inflection in the fixed price platform given the early stages of implementation. As such, the exciting benefits of the fixed price platform were not baked into the base case and left as an asymmetric source of upside. In our base case DCF for ANGI, we use a 16% CAGR on the top line for 6 years (well below the company's 20-25% target range) and a terminal EBITDA margin of 26% (decently below the company's 35% long-term target). These assumptions result in a value for ANGI of $16.00 per share, over twice the price we initiated the position at. Dropbox-Storing Files and Saving Time We have long admired Dropbox for how it facilitated the operations side of our business at RGAIA. As many of you have experienced, we can securely share files, with HIPAA/HITECH compliant encryption, password protection and links that expire, without ever attaching sensitive documents to an actual email. Many people were first exposed to Dropbox through the free, limited space offering that spread virally amongst certain peer groups. Through virality alone, Dropbox has built up a universe of 600 million users, 360 million of whom are #8216;potentially monetizable#8217; in either their personal or business capacities. The virality of the product affords Dropbox a major advantage in customer acquisition. Dropbox is a classic example of a company that stayed private for too long only to come public when growth was slowing and questions about competition intensifying. Some contend that the cloud storage space has been commoditized by Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon offering competing services to Dropbox, bundled into broader suites and as such, #8216;free#8217; to the customer. Although there is some merit, especially in the retail photo-sharing and saving market, these concerns miss how valuable Dropbox' suite of services with greater power and flexibility have become in the workflow of small and mid-size businesses. We have often expressed an affinity for pure-plays against large, well-capitalized competitors due to the contrast of having a product be one's essence versus one's unit. This further helps Dropbox vis--vis the technology giants as the company's engineering-centric culture further iterates and improves its product suite while competitors rely on free being #8216;good enough#8217; for the customers who use it. In the storage market, there is room for both. There is a misperception due to the viral origins of the product that most users are individuals, when in fact 80% of Dropbox users deploy the product primarily for work, with the remainder personal. On the surface, competing with free looks like a losing battle; however, in reality,Dropbox' suite ends up priced as a tiny cost in a typical business' operating budget and its better UI/UX as a product saves time in quantifiable ways. Its robust tools for control are crucial to businesses in regulated industries and its fluidity in sharing is a true differentiator from mere #8216;storage#8217; in collaborative industries like architecture, sales, engineering and inventory management. In the third quarter, Dropbox reported that the average user paid $123.15. While this number is clearly more expensive than free, it can be contextualized as follows: according to the BLS, the average worker in the US earns $28.32 per hour of work, while the average information worker earns $42.34 an hour.[9] If the advantages of Dropbox over the competition save the average worker 4.3 hours in an entire year or the average information worker 2.9 hours in a year, Dropbox pays for itself. With a better product suite, the bar is not too high for Dropbox to deliver a demonstrable benefit over the large scale, unfocused challengers. The greatest evidence that Dropbox is meeting the needs of its customers stems from both its ability to raise prices as a growth lever alongside declining churn in aggregate. Dropbox recently raised the price of its Plus plan by 20% and while the company suggested it might slow net new customer additions for the next several quarters, there has only been a modest uptick in churn.[10] Customers already onboard clearly recognize the value. To make the price increase more palatable, they executed the price hike intelligently, along with doubling storage capacity and adding functionality like restoring folders and/or files to past dates. Dropbox benefits from multiple growth levers, including the aforementioned pricing power, along with opportunities to lower churn, improved conversion of free to paid and more products like Paper and New Dropbox. With net revenue retention in the mid-90s and customer retention in the mid-to-upper 80s (probably higher but think mid-90s less mid single digits ARPU lift), at today's $6.6 billion enterprise value, assuming a 7 year average customer lifespan, you are buying the value of the existing customer base with any growth essentially free on top. If that lifespan drops to five years, there would be 15% downside; however, given that the company will have grown its user base in the low teens in 2019 and users will grow base case in the high single digits in 2020, we see a margin of safety in the churn assumption. Dropbox is a Rule of 40 SaaS company[11], with a commitment to the market of expanding margins as growth moderates. If growth reaccelerates, they will be able to maintain margin. When adjusting free cash flow for duplicative headquarter expenses that will end in 2020, the trailing free cash flow yield here is over 5.4%. Rarely does one find companies growing so much faster than the market with a higher free cash flow yield. Founder Drew Huston showed what he thinks of the stock this fall, buying $10 million worth on the open market.With an over-capitalized balance sheet and some clear frustration with the stock's performance, perhaps the company considers commencing a largescale repurchase program in the coming year.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-4.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-4.png</url> Grubhub-Eat or be Eaten, The Story of an Upset Stomach We revisited our thesis on Grubhub in our Q1 2019 commentary and events have not played out as hoped. We want to take this as an opportunity to share some lessons learned and our reassessment of the thesis from here. We simplified our thesis in Grubhub with an intense focus on #8216;economic parity#8217; which we explained as follows: #8216; Grubhub could reach what they call #8216;economic parity#8217; between marketplace and delivery orders as measured by EBITDA per order, leaving the platform agnostic, the diner indifferent and the restaurant empowered to choose the model that best fit its own needs.#8217; Unfortunately while Grubhub did achieve a number nearing economic parity in Q3 2019, the level of parity was well below where the marketplace had been trending largely a consequence of growth slowing well below management's and our expectation. Such is the nature of businesses with serious operating leverage. In the future, we will focus our simplification efforts on situations where there is a distinct qualitative tie-in to the customer relationship. This means we will either isolate on a revenue driver (as we did with engagement on PayPal) or a margin item with a direct customer nexus.[12] Alongside the disappointing results, management issued a unique shareholder letter analyzing the history of the nascent online delivery industry and the competitive landscape today, blaming increasingly #8216;promiscuous#8217; behavior from diners due to promotional activity at competitors for the problems. In response, management made the case to shareholders for pursuing a #8216;scorched Earth#8217; strategy whereby Grubhub would spend (invest?) its own cash flows just at the moment when competitors like UberEats and Doordash were attempting to delivery on promises to its current and prospective investors for a path to profitability. It is difficult to determine whether the Grubhub move is offensive or defensive in nature. It is offensive insofar as the company is attempting aggressively to win diners; however, it is defensive for how it aims to keep competitors in a grinding battle defending their core markets instead of spending more aggressively to fight Grub on its own turf. Essentially the battleground in this delivery war has been primarily second and third tier cities\u2014the new frontiers of growth\u2014while marketshares in the Northeast have remained largely stable for Grubhub.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-6.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-6.png</url> [13] Upon hitting #8216;send#8217; on this letter, whether they knew it or not, management commenced a tectonic shift in the food delivery landscape. In Europe and around the world, a wave of consolidation is taking place in the industry, while the US has thus far been mostly immune (Doordash taking over Caviar aside). With the sharp reset in Grubhub's stock price, the economic accretion available to those with larger market caps in the industry looks increasingly attractive. Taking a glance at the city-by-city breakdown shows the clearest opportunity in Grubhub's stock today: With 67% of New York City marketshare (with an over-representation to Manhattan itself), whoever acquires Grubhub between Uber and Doordash will own 80% of the single most valuable delivery marketplace in the country. 80% is a magic number first noted by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in what is now known as the #8216;Pareto Principle.#8217; If one player achieves 80% share in NYC they will likely generate over 100% of the EBITDA in that one key geography. At the October 30th closing price of $34/share, Grubhub was trading for a discount to the standalone NYC value. NYC alone generates upwards of $250m in EBITDA which gets reinvested within the company to other growth initiatives. What choice do those with broad aspirations in the sector have but to give an acquisition a look? The list of potential acquirers is deeper than just the two main US competitors. Prosus, a Naspers carve-out with a focus on the food delivery space has large, global ambitions.[14] Strategic acquirers range from big tech companies to super market companies. Most logically we think someone already in the industry, who is bleeding cash but wants to grow, will find the ridiculously high cash flow margins of the core marketplace business a crucial piece in achieving their own aspirations for profitable, cash flowing growth. While the recent path in this stock has been turbulent, we still remain sanguine on a constructive outcome. Twitter: Will this bird finally set sail? In many respects, Q3 2019 should have been cause for a chest-thumping victory lap at TWTR. Account growth, as measured by year-over-year monetizable daily active usage (mDAUs) slowed to the single digits in the second-half of 2018. In Q3 2019 this number registered 17% year-over-year growth, the fastest rate of mDAU growth in at least three years. With pure inertia it will end the year closer to 20%. Notably, this acceleration happened without any major events or catalysts to spark engagement, on top of a tough comp with the World Cup having occurred in the same quarter, last year. Historically, the stock has moved based on the trend in mDAUs; however, this past quarter's report came with a new problem. Twitter was inappropriately using data for personalization on accounts who had opted out of data collection and Twitter shared data with mobile application promotion (MAP) advertisers it should not have shared.[15] These problems collectively stem from a lack of investment in revenue product while the company was laser-focused on enhancing the user experience. MAP in particular is a big revenue product in Japan, which is Twitter's second largest market after the US. ARPU in Japan was thus down meaningfully, dampening the impact of the mDAU acceleration. Our analysis shows that while the US ARPU will actually be up somewhere around 5% in 2019, International will be down 3.4% and Japan in particular will be down over 12%. In a loose sense, it might be fair to suggest these problems are isolated and they open up intriguing possibilities. Improving the demand response product is a major opportunity that will now get the attention it deserves: But what can we do around direct response and bringing more advertisers to the service? So our MAP work should lead to more direct response-type opportunities over time. And in terms of bringing more advertisers to the service, we have a nice business where we help smaller advertisers in reaching their customers on Twitter, but that's not an area that we have prioritized improvements around in the recent past. It's a place where we know that there's millions of small businesses throughout the service, where we could help them more in reaching their customers on Twitter. But we've got to do the engineering work and make the case to them better than we are today. And right now we've chosen to prioritize other things first.[16] Twitter has a fair reason for putting off the redevelopment of direct response revenue products. The platform is well-established for brand building and product launches; however, that might have been at risk had the company not achieved measurable progress on safety and user growth first. If they put demand response ahead of user experience as a priority, they might have lost this crucial support (and budget) in the advertising community and considerable revenue, which would have rendered any progress futile. Now that the company has a growing user-base story once again, we think it is only a matter of time for revenue to follow. From a valuation perspective, the Twitter only needs modest ARPU growth in order to support today's prices. We like backing into the market's implied expectations and using 2.7% ARPU up-lift per year, for eight years (well below the trend of the last three years) Twitter's user growth would need to track the yellow line in the following chart in order to justify today's market cap:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-7.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/RGA-Investment-Advisors-4Q19-7.png</url> Importantly, the yellow line today is in the process of accelerating and it is rare that these things so swiftly reverse. This is especially so with 2020 being an Olympic and a US election year. Meanwhile, the opportunity on ARPU remains relatively untapped. We think one of the single biggest opportunities for Twitter is launching paid feeds whereby instead of merely #8216;following#8217; another user, someone could #8216;subscribe#8217; to a feed and Twitter could take their cut for building the infrastructure to make it all work. There are companies who do this over Twitter's rails, like Premo Social, for an all-in take rate of about 13%.[17] This would be an intriguing revenue opportunity considering most Internet revenue at the giant Internet companies comes from advertising. A subscription-based take rate would be far less volatile, far more consistent and open the door to all kinds of serendipity for the platform. The hurdle for success on the existing business here is set very low. Should the acceleration in mDAUs persist, the stock would be worth upwards of $60 without any ARPU recovery. If ARPU recovers its swoon and returns to a 5% growth trend, this is upwards of a $70 stock. New paths to monetization are pure optionality. Taken as a whole, Twitter is one of the most compelling risk/reward opportunities we have seen.Where it all goes from here:It is impossible to know what the market will do from year-to-year and what kinds of stocks the market will take a liking to. What is knowable is that over the long run, stocks are worth the discount of their future cash flows. These companies we discussed today all share many common traits that lend themselves to good future returns including: 1) low starting valuation; 2) high margins and 3) good growth tailwinds. While these companies in many respects share a lot of similarities, importantly, the key drivers of their revenues are all unique. ANGI connects homeowners and service professionals, Dropbox is a service for small and mid-sized businesses, Grubhub connects diners and restaurants and Twitter is the modern associated press and interest network for the masses. In other words, none of these companies will be reliant on the same macro forces to drive their profitability, while all are in advantaged areas ready to move key offline processes to the digital world. These companies also share another important trait with respect to their institutional imperative. Companies with no profits and rapid growth are incentivized to pull the growth lever and gear their organizations accordingly. In effect, one can say the objective of such companies is to grow. These companies we are highlighting do exhibit growth; however, their institutional imperative is far more balanced: they are incentivized to deliver both growth and profitability. Companies that understand the tradeoff between growth and profitability gear their organizations towards achieving profitable growth. Growth then becomes about scaling proven unit economics instead of goosing the top line at all costs. It is important for management teams to effectively communicate how they think about these tradeoffs to their shareholder base. One reason Grubhub has been so volatile is how poorly the company has managed communication with a shareholder base focused on margin, in a competitive landscape dominated by companies whose owners are pushing for growth at all costs. Grubhub's institutional mandate put the company at odds with the demands of its industry; however, the company's profitability in core markets provides the financial lifeline necessary to know life will persist even when the regime shifts. Market regimes will inevitably shift the extent to which they reward growth and that will be painful for companies who have not yet created pathways to profitability with talent and staff who understand the precise balance between the underlying levers that drive the tradeoff. Growth-at-all-cost companies can prove their ability to grow, though they cannot explain, nor can investors determine whether they are merely growing, or scaling proven unit economics. When companies exhibit both growth and profitability, there is implicit evidence the unit economics do work and that scale can deliver more profit long-term. Further, profitable growth companies have the added financial flexibility and runway necessary to experiment with ways to improve their offerings and accelerate their growth in out-years while profitless growth companies will spend their time figuring out how to turn $1 of revenue into some degree of margin.

Yet, unlike existing venture capital or private equity firms, RHL has an interesting structure. Its three partners hold jobs outside the firm: Rachel Lau is vice-president with Heitman Investment Management; Raja Hamzah Abidin is the head of business development in Rasma Corp.; and Lionel Leong is the director of operations of Mah Sing Group, the largest non-GLC (government-linked corporation) property developer in Malaysia. The firm's name was the easy part-with 'R' from Rachel, H for Hamzah and L for Leong. So, how does the fund operate and what is its corpus?</p><p> \"We're like a multi-family, multi-strategy PE fund. There is no fixed tenure because it is essentially family money at this point and the idea is to make good investments along the way... We got a size in our heads which the three of us are very happy ponying up at this point, but there's no one size per se because we're happy to do it in multiple ways right? The first layer is me, Hamzah and Leong. The second layer is our families coming in to back and there are also friends that we pull in,\" said Rachel in a recent interview. RHL made its first ever investment of an undisclosed amount in Singapore-based customer engagement and loyalty solutions provider Perx Technologies, which counts Singapore-based VC firm Golden Gate Ventures and investors like Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin among its investors.</p><p>Investment theme</p><p>Against the trend of local VCs often looking for quick exits, Lau said the Kuala Lumpur- based firm was looking to stay invested in its portfolio firms for about 5-7 years, while adding that the firm would reach out to tap the expertise of friends and industry experts process deals across sectors. RHL also claimed to possess in-house expertise on certain sectors such as real estate, riding on Lionel Leong's experience in this space. According to Raja Hamzah, while the firm was sector-agnostic, there were a few areas where it looked to make investments based on the strength of its promoters, including financial services, property, health and wellness and health care. \"For the start-up, we can help bridge the gap between starting out and reaching the next step-we feel that our networks are important to them, whether it is market testing or just talking to different people with different opinions because they need all the help they can get,\" he added. His reply also leads to an interesting question that is related to a point that is often mentioned by every VC-using their networks and expertise to help their portfolio companies. Could RHL's three promoters lend their expertise and help their portfolio companies, even as they retained their current jobs with their respective companies? Rachel points out that the three of them had been making investments in their individual capacities for about a decade and had decided to join hands as it involved \"far too much work to handle alone\". \"Because we were looking at individual investments, and often times we were looking at the same investments, so we decided to pull our money together, resources, build a team that way. Obviously, there's a possibility for us to move into this full-time-the transition time hasn't been announced because we're still working our current jobs. At this point, Hamzah will be running RHL more or less full time....He's got his other stuff, but I think he's the main guy.\" In addition to being open to looking at deals across sectors, the duo also said RHL was country-agnostic. \"We have a regional focus, but we've been looking deals across SEA...we've been looking deals in Europe and America where we want to bring them into SEA. So we're quite flexible, we use SEA as a strategic place. We want to be able to add the strategic value to the company,\" said Hamzah. Lau adds, \"So when we bring someone from the US, it's because there's a specific thing we want to bring them here (in SEA) for...and that's when you come in and say that we add strategic value. We will lay out the specific reason why we want you to come to SEA, and we will open doors for you here.\" According to Lau, there are no plans to consolidate their individual investments or existing portfolio of companies into RHL.</p><p>Outside tech, external advisers</p><p>In addition to being sector agnostic, RHL is also looking beyond the technology space. Hamzah even pointed out that even traditional sectors that were now using digital means to sell their products were being classified as 'tech', when in reality, these businesses were only using online platforms 'as an enabler'. Hamzah argues that the advent of crowdfunding platforms in Malaysia-which took the lead in being the first country to roll out legislation and legalize crowdfunding- would help non-tech start-ups attract funding from a diverse range of investors. In addition, he argues that most enterprises outside the tech space have more balanced valuations. Most VCs in South-East Asia claim to offer \"special expertise and introduction to their networks\", but many start-up founders in the portfolios of such firms often privately admit that such VCs bring little to the table apart from money. Lau counters this view, claiming that RHL has advisers with \"unmatched industry experience\". According to the company, its advisers include Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai, chairman and founder of Top Glove Corp., reportedly the world's largest glove manufacturer with 25% of the global market. Other advisers claimed by the company include Tan Sri Dato' Sri Leong Hoy Kum, founder of Mah Sing Group and Datuk Seri Utama Raja Nong Chik, chairman of Rasma Corp., a mechanical and electrical contractor. Other advisers are Marlon Sanchez from Deutsche Bank and Francesco Barrai from DE Shaw. Lau says: \"So, we've got a very strong board that either mentors or comes in with us. I wouldn't say that we mentor a start-up-we come in as partners, if you're looking for someone to guide you, we are not the ones to guide you-this is your business and we are investors. The only reason we use the term strategic is that we have the backgrounds to enable us to get you the extra knowledge and we do open up doors,\" . Adds Hamzah, \"At the execution level is where we feel like we can assist, but we don't micromanage the investee companies... we have full faith in the management team and how they execute. Just getting the extra steps will enable them to grow revenue 5x, 10x in a year. To get the extra push and I think that's where I think we can add in a lot of value into our investee company.\" The duo also said RHL is not in the seed space, but preferred to put capital into companies that had traction and had been operational for a bit. \"So when you talk about Series A and B, we want to be a long-term investor and we have the ability to do that as well. So we want to be able to go through the cycle, whether its 3, 5 or 7 years and exit together with the company, whether it's a trade sale or IPO and so on,\" said Hamzah.</p><p>Exit events</p><p>Discussing exits, both Lau and Hamzah did not rule out listings as a possible option in the region, despite the fact that markets in the region have remained sluggish for an extended period. While the firm is of the view that encouraging companies to explore public markets remains part of its investment process, the duo also admitted that very few tech companies in the region were actually ready for a listing now, and pointed out that an IPO route usually required 5-7 years of operations. Lau also highlighted that most successful tech start-ups in Asean were under four years old, but remained confident that the tide would turn and that exchanges like that of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) would see more listings in the next 5-10 years. Yet, Singapore will still have challenges. \"While I have spoken to a few exchanges, the NYSE, the SGX, my perspective is they're making it way too difficult and expensive for a start-up to list in Singapore, and that is why a lot of these companies are (it's too expensive) and that's why people go to Australia (ASX). There's a legacy behind ASX right? It's because the mining companies needed quick cash at one point, so they were happy to go up to be traded as a micro-stock or penny stock.\" She adds, \"Now, because mining is no longer in favour, they allow the listing of tech companies, where there is potential for growth-this is a new mining for Australia. I believe that the Singapore and Kuala Lumpur exchanges are looking at reducing some regulations to either match the ASX or to better it.\" Hamzah says that Malaysia could be the first market in the region to witness listings of tech start-ups, highlighting that institutional investors-including state funds such as Malaysia's EPF, and pension fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan KWAP-have begun investing in mature technology start-ups. \"KWAP, which just made a $30 million investment in Uber, it was their first big tech investment. Following the cue of KWAP, Khanzah and EPF will likely explore more investments in the tech space. EPF especially has never done anything in this space; so, if they do, and they allocate 0.5% if their fund to this space, it moves market in a significant way,\" he adds. According to many start-up professionals, VC firm executives and industry observers, the pain point for South-East Asia is the Series B investment round. Alternatively, it is those companies seeking to raise between $15 million to $50 million. This space has few players, aside from firms such as Singapore- based Vertex Ventures and Malaysia's Khazanah, to an extent. According to Lau, a possible reason why most regional VCs focus on the seed stage could be the small size of funds in the region, \"If you pump in $50 million into a fund in this region, you become the biggest LP (limited partner). A lot of institutional guys don't want to take that risk, they don't want to be the largest LP or the largest investor in the fund. But as fund sizes here grows, we'll see the attitude changing, and I think there will be people who will want to commit bigger amounts.\"</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from MintAsia.

Verdi shares insight with Investorideas.com on the year ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an exclusive Q&amp;A, Mr. Verdi discusses recent ventures including new movie deals and\u00a0his investments in\u00a0game-changing\u00a0technologies,\u00a0including Apple and\u00a0biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (OTCQB: NXTD) (OTCBB: NXTD),\u00a0which\u00a0is currently\u00a0preparing\u00a0to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket(TM), (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wocketwallet.com\">http://www.wocketwallet.com</url>) with advance orders starting May 28th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com</p><p>This past year has already seen\u00a0you reach\u00a0some key milestones;\u00a0making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less\u00a0than a\u00a0year. What\u00a0are you most excited about for the balance of this year?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A.\u00a0Verdi</p><p>Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am\u00a0the\u00a0most excited about NXTD right now,\u00a0only because they are about to launch the Wocket(TM)\u00a0this month.\u00a0Wocket(TM)\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0smart wallet\u00a0with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics.</p><p>I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide.\u00a0Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps\u00a0like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it.\u00a0I think Wocket(TM)\u00a0has the right approach; separate from\u00a0your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens\u00a0if\u00a0they\u00a0lose\u00a0their phone or it gets stolen\u00a0-\u00a0what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket(TM),\u00a0it's\u00a0not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info\u00a0are\u00a0safe!</p><p>It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the\u00a0payment sector that I thought it would!\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com</p><p>In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and\u00a0Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks\u00a0and invest in smaller\u00a0companies with emerging technology like\u00a0NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A. Verdi</p><p>I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like\u00a0I\u00a0have with\u00a0NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works.</p><p>Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but\u00a0it's\u00a0hard to know if the vision will stay intact. \u00a0NXTD\u00a0is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that.\u00a0</p><p>In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and\u00a0currently\u00a0needs. The Wocket(TM)\u00a0can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's\u00a0never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product;\u00a0the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my\u00a0second-largest\u00a0holding.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com</p><p>The company stated that they will launch the Wocket(TM)\u00a0May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking\u00a0advance orders\u00a0for the\u00a0Wocket(TM)\u00a0once the event is done.\u00a0Will you be attending and will you be buying one\u00a0once advance orders are opened up?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad\u00a0A. Verdi</p><p>For sure I will be there\u00a0supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket(TM)\u00a0is embraced.\u00a0And of course,\u00a0I will be buying many, many\u00a0Wockets(TM)!\u00a0I will be giving\u00a0them out\u00a0to all\u00a0of\u00a0my actor and\u00a0celebrity\u00a0friends in Hollywood.\u00a0Soon, you\u00a0may see a Wocket(TM)\u00a0in a\u00a0very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com</p><p>Speaking about Hollywood and movies,\u00a0you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB\u00a0you have signed on\u00a0Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you\u00a0have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films.\u00a0It seems like you are on fire!\u00a0How did this all come about?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad A. Verdi\u00a0</p><p>Yes, it's just\u00a0nuts, crazy nuts!\u00a0It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his\u00a0producing\u00a0partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,'\u00a0Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and\u00a0they invited us to the premiere\u00a0of 'The Wolf\u00a0of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called\u00a0'Bad Hurt'\u00a0that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated\u00a0to\u00a0where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, \u00a0'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza.</p><p>Q:\u00a0Investorideas.com</p><p>That is exciting and all\u00a0happening\u00a0very fast.\u00a0How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the\u00a0ten\u00a0picture deal with Screen Media?</p><p>A:\u00a0Chad A. Verdi\u00a0</p><p>That's\u00a0what's\u00a0amazing. Eighteen\u00a0months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for\u00a0This\u00a0and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later\u00a0than\u00a0fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December\u00a02014. Then\u00a0we\u00a0begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is\u00a0to\u00a0meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to\u00a0facilitate\u00a0this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this\u00a0gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with.</p><p>About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company:\u00a0Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/,http://www.verdifilms.com/\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/,http://www.verdifilms.com/</url></p><p>About Chad Verdi</p><p>Chad A.

I'm Heidi Collins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TONY HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Tony Harris. The second hour in THE NEWSROOM this morning, to stay informed. Here's what's on the rundown. Washington's top diplomat pressing Asian allies to make North Korean sanctions really bite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COLLINS: Heartland voters in a sour mood. Our guests look at the campaign issues that matter to them three weeks now before the midterms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARRIS: And stocks playing with history. The Dow passing the 12,000 mark for the first time on this Wednesday, October 18th. You are in THE NEWSROOM.</p><p>COLLINS: We've been hearing about, oh, for the past seven days or so, the Dow breaking records, but today the biggest record yet, the 12,000 mark. Susan Lisovicz standing by (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ: Good morning, Heidi. Well, it is an historical day here at the New York Stock (INAUDIBLE) -- Dow Jones Industrial Average easily topping 12,000 for the first time in history, and it came easy. It came quick, 34 seconds into the new trading session we went over that milestone easily.</p><p>And you know, we were talking two days ago about the oomph factor, because the Dow couldn't get -- it got within three points of Dow 12,000, couldn't quite make it. We got the oomph an hour before the trading day today when we got the Consumer Price Index. Inflation at the consumer level came in lower than expected. Inflation is public enemy number one for the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The Fed meets next week to decide on interest rates and there's a big sigh of relief on this factor. Yes, that the economy is cooling and that one of the things that is helpful there is that inflation is moderating. We're also in the midst of earning season. We got a lot of help from IBM. Big blue shares up six percent on its quarterly profits. It jumped more than fifty percent. IBM is a member of the Dow 30 and so is Intel, another big chip -- another big tech company. It's shares up about three percent. Its profits actually dropped in the quarter by more than one-third, but it was better than Wall Street's estimates and its shares are up about three percent.</p><p>So a lot of help in the early going from both the inflation report and some of the big companies that are reporting quarterly earnings. Heidi?</p><p>COLLINS: And Susan it took us awhile to get there. I think, if I remember correctly, when we went from the 10,000 to 11,000 mark it was something like 24 days. But 11,000 to 12,000, took some time.</p><p>LISOVICZ: yes, and, I mean, you have to think about what -- what the market, what investors, what we all have been through in the last few years, not only a bear market and the dot-com bust, 9/11, war in Iraq. I mean, a lot of things that shook investor sentiment. October is historically not a kind month for the stock markets, when we saw the 1929 crash and the 1987 crash. But this market has been resilient.</p><p>One of the things that helped the economy in the last few years has been the housing market. That's pretty much gone away. But in recent months, Heidi, as you well know, energy prices have come down, and the Federal Reserve has paused on interest rates. And both of those are big reasons why the stock market has come back so much. So the Dow is at all-time highs. I should mention that the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 not close to that, but still at 5 1/2-year highs.</p><p>COLLINS: All right. Susan Lisovicz with the good news of the day. We like it. Thanks, Susan.</p><p>LISOVICZ: You're welcome, Heidi.</p><p>HARRIS: The North Korea threat. Here's what we know. This hour, <person><nameText>Secretary of State Condoleezza </nameText></person>Rice is in Japan, the first stop of her Asian travels. She's trying to shore up support for the United Nations sanctions against North Korea and its defiant nuclear test. Her visit comes with new concerns. We're told activity suggests North Korea could be preparing for a second nuclear test. Tomorrow Rice travels to South Korea and then it is on to China and Russia.</p><p>Let's get the latest on this developing story from CNN's Aneesh Raman.</p><p>ANEESH RAMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: U.S.<person><nameText>Secretary of State Condoleezza </nameText></person>Rice starting off her four-day, four-nation tour in Asia in friendly territory, here in Japan. She met today with the Japanese foreign minister and defense minister.</p><p>Tomorrow she'll meet with Japan's prime minister. Japan and the U.S. see virtually eye to eye on imposing those sanctions levied against North Korea by Japan. Japan, of course, slammed its own sanctions on North Korea even before the U.N. took action. The key to her trip here was voicing a sense of commitment to Japan, to the defensive alliance between the U.S. and Japan. Here's what she had to say at that press conference.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>CONDOLEEZZA RICE, </nameText></person>U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Japan has answered this question. The prime minister has answered the question. The foreign minister has answered the question. The role of the United States is to make certain that everybody, including the North Koreans, know very well that the United States will fully recognize and act upon its obligations under the mutual defense treaty and in defense of our Japanese ally. And I have reconfirmed that that is the American view and the American position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAMAN: That is key because the U.S. is essentially the biggest part of the Japanese defense strategy. Some 30,000 U.S. troops are here in Japan, growing increasingly tense amid the growing signs of aggression out of Pyongyang. Now another part of this trip for the secretary of state is getting not really Japan, but South Korea and China, to impose all of those sanctions put against North Korea by the U.N. She spoke to the need and the complexity that will come in her later visits, as well, at the press conference earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICE: The resolution was passed very quickly, in record time for the United Nations, and so it's not surprising that there are a number of details to be worked out. But I'd just like to make a couple of points clear. First of all, the United States has no desire to escalate this crisis. In fact, we would like to see it de-escalate.</p><p>And the resolution 1718's principal aim is to do two things. First of all, to deal with the potential effects of North Korea trying to transfer materials or to obtain materials. That's why there is an embargo, as there is also an embargo on certain kinds of arms. And it's the obligation of states under 1718 to make certain to use the tools that they have that that is not -- that transfer is not happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAMAN: Details to be worked out, she said, not divisions really between the U.S. and South Korea and China. But, of course, that is where she will face the true diplomatic test, getting those countries, who are wary of destabilizing the regime in Pyongyang and creating perhaps a humanitarian crisis, to check, for example, all cargo going into and out of North Korea. She heads to Seoul tomorrow. Then onward from there to Beijing.</p><p>Aneesh Raman, CNN, Tokyo.</p><p>COLLINS: Eyes in the skies. The Bush administration keeping a close eye on any signs North Korea could be preparing for a second nuclear test. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the North Korean capital Pyongyang, a lavish celebration of the communist regime's accomplishments over the past 80 years was broadcast to the world. But intelligence analysts were looking at different images. Images that were picked up from a remote area far outside the capital and showed what could be preparations for a second underground nuclear test. DONALD RUMSFELD, DEFENSE SECRETARY: There is speculation that they may want to do something additional. There's also speculation they may not. So only time will tell.</p><p>STARR: According to intelligence and military officials, U.S. spy satellites have seen signs of activity again at several North Korean sites that could be used for nuclear tests. The Bush administration isn't sure what it all means. At two of the sites, small structures have been put up, perhaps to keep the preparations hidden. U.S. officials say what worries them most is that the new activity is very similar to what happened just before the first test.</p><p>The U.S. is also closely monitoring statements by senior North Korean officials and military leaders for any sign that additional nuclear tests are in the works. One thing that got analysts attention was a statement on North Korean television that the U.N. sanctions are, quote, a declaration of war. Intelligence analysts note that kind of rhetoric has been increasing anxiety in China in recent days. There are worries additional tests would further destabilize the region.</p><p>The U.S. believes a defiant Kim Jong-il might soon pursue a second test because the first test seems to have partially failed, and he may want to prove he has a nuclear weapon that works.</p><p>JAMES LILLEY, FMR. U.S. AMB. TO SOUTH KOREA: He's thumbing his nose at the world. He's going to do this and get his people mobilized. He's going to appeal to all of his third world friends in Iran, Venezuela, Castro in Cuba, Shahir (ph) in Sudan. These are his people. He is saying, I can stand up. This is my nuke. It's a show.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: Barbara Starr joining us now live from the Pentagon. Barbara, what's the latest this morning now with these missile sites?</p><p>STARR: Well, on the missile sites, on the ballistic missile sites, you'll recall Heidi, of course, we saw a number of launches from North Korea on July 4th. Analysts say the latest intelligence now shows those missile sites remain at a very high state of readiness. The North Koreans could use them in the next several days, for example. No one is saying they will, but those sites do appear very ready.</p><p>On the underground test, different than the missile sites, underground nuclear detonation tests, the analysts say that the latest U.S. understanding is that the North Koreans have told China they are prepared to do as many as three additional tests as part of their overall test program. Again, no one can say for sure, so nobody is making any predictions, but there's plenty of worry Heidi.</p><p>COLLINS: But still no talk of military reaction, if, indeed, there is a second test.</p><p>STARR: Right. By all indications, really, the Bush administration plans to stick with the diplomatic front through the United Nations, through its allies in the region, where the secretary of state is now traveling, work the sanctions as hard as they can. But if there are additional tests, who knows. It could open the door to another review. Still at this point, diplomacy is the road the White House appears to be very determined to stick to.</p><p>COLLINS: Understood. Barbara Starr from the Pentagon this morning. Thank you Barbara.</p><p>HARRIS: The U.S. death toll in Iraq rising at a fast clip this month. Ten more troops killed in bombings and in battle.</p><p>Live now to CNN's Arwa Damon in Baghdad. Arwa, you have -- there was a lot going on, a lot of activity in the northern city of Balad. And i understand you have some pictures to help tell us exactly what is going on there.</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Tony. Now, if we just take a few steps back, though, as to what happened in Balad, sectarian violence flared there. And it began on Friday when the bodies of 19 Shia construction workers were found in one of the mainly Sunni areas. Now Balad is an area that is predominantly Shia. The population is centered in the core of the city around a holy Shia shrine. Just outside lies the Sunni population.</p><p>On Friday they found the bodies of 19 Shia workers in one of these Sunni towns outside. The following day, they found the bodies of 38 Sunni workers, this time believed to be an attack in retaliation. Sectarian violence there flared. The Iraqi and U.S. troops flooded the city in an area to try to bring it all under control. And finally, we are hearing that now senior tribal leaders, both from the Sunni and Shia tribes in that area, have come together to try to bring an end to the sectarian violence, Tony.</p><p>HARRIS: Oh man, these pictures are -- OK. Arwa, moving on. We haven't talked much about the Saddam Hussein trial recently. What's the latest there?</p><p>DAMON: Well, Tony, the trial does continue. We heard more witness testimony today. The interesting thing to point out though is that for the last two days of court, Saddam Hussein, though still slightly defiant, has been, compared to what we have seen in the past, relatively subdued. If you remember back on September 20th, the court appointed a new chief judge. Since that new chief judge took over court, we have seen fierce exchanges between him and Saddam Hussein. Most of which have ended in Saddam Hussein being removed from court.</p><p>What we saw today and what we saw yesterday is a still slightly defiant, but relatively subdued, Saddam Hussein, allowing the court proceedings to proceed in a relatively, remembering here that when it does come to the Saddam Hussein trial it is all relatively proper mannered, Tony.</p><p>HARRIS: OK, Arwa Damon for us in Baghdad. Arwa thank you.</p><p>He says he was abused by a priest. Now ex-Congressman Mark Foley says he's ready to reveal his alleged abuser. Details in THE NEWSROOM.</p><p>COLLINS: Middle class issues in middle America, a look at politics in the heartland less than three weeks now from election day -- midterm elections rather.</p><p>HARRIS: And wanted for a kidnapping and a killing. The search is on for a Kentucky mother and her baby. An update straight ahead.</p><p>HARRIS: The Capitol e-mail scandal emerging today with the Catholic priest abuse scandal. Ex-Congressman Mark Foley says he's ready to reveal the name of a priest who allegedly molested him years ago. Foley made the claim after he resigned over explicit computer messages to congressional pages.</p><p>National correspondent Susan Candiotti live from Miami with this developing story. Susan, what is the Archdiocese of Miami saying about these latest developments?</p><p>SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we haven't heard anything about them yet, but of course the Archdiocese would like to get the name so it can take further action. But this morning, both of the lawyers for ex-Congressman Foley will be meeting with the Congressman, ex-Congressman by telephone. And at that time, the civil lawyer will find out for the first time the name of the priest who allegedly molested Mr. Foley when he was a teenager.</p><p>Now Foley's attorney says that he hopes to have a meeting soon with the Miami Archdiocese to turn over that name and that he furthermore hopes that the Archdiocese will take what he calls appropriate action. A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Miami says that the name of the alleged child molester will be released to the public at some point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY ROSS AGOSTA, CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE OF MIAMI: And one of the elements of the policy is that you identify the priest and then you make the offer of pastoral counseling to the alleged victim, as well as the alleged abuser and then also ask if anyone else has been a victim of sexual abuse by this priest to please come forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CANDIOTTI: Now, both the Palm Beach state attorney's office, as well as the lawyer for Mr. Foley, says that no criminal charges will be filed because the case is way too old.

President Hamid Karzai tells the Associated Press Mullah Omar, the Taliban supreme leader, is hiding in Quetta (ph), Pakistan. He also blames Pakistan for surging Taliban violence in Afghanistan and calls on the Pakistani leader to do more to crack down on militants. From Pakistan's government, a blunt rejection of Karzai's claims.</p><p>And blunt assessment on Afghanistan now. It comes from the former commander of British forces in that country. Brigadier Ed Butler says international troops may have to stay in Afghanistan for the next 20 years. In the short term, he warns the Taliban may regroup over the winter and come back even stronger next year. Butler says British forces are having to make up for time lost to the Iraq war instead of concentrating on Afghanistan. Butler has just returned home to Britain after giving up his command in Afghanistan.</p><p>HARRIS: Playground clampdown. Tag banned at one elementary school. What do you think of that?

Look at that. Oh, well we're down just an itty, bitty bit, but we have already cross that inter-day high and the record mark of 12,000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Man, it is up, up, up.</p><p>So we're going to go to Susan Lisovicz. She's on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange live in just a few minutes to get a little bit more reaction as to what's going on there today.</p><p>HARRIS: Yes, we want to get to Fredricka Whitfield right now. She's following this really horrible, disturbing story out of Kentucky for us. An amber alert. The search is on for this 10-month-old baby boy. Fred, what's the latest? FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Well, the search is intensifying for that baby boy after the 67-year-old social worker that was caring for the child was found dead in Henderson, Kentucky. But now police are hoping that they can get some kind of break out of a development that now has them focusing on Smithboro, Illinois. And the reason why is because a videotape, shot at a gas station, shows that in Smithboro, Illinois, 33-year-old -- or rather 23-year-old Christopher Latrelle (ph), possibly may be the one getting out of this vehicle here and using a credit card to pay for gasoline.</p><p>It's believed that Latrelle is with 33-year-old Rene Tarrell (ph), who is the mother of the 9-month-old boy. And it's believed that the two of them had something to do with the beating death of the 67-year-old social worker, before then taking the 9-month-old baby away. The only problem with that videotape, while it gives them some sort of possible identification of one of the people in that couple, it doesn't show the license plate. No video of the license plate of that vehicle. So police are still hoping that that videotape may help lead them to the whereabouts of these two people.</p><p>Now there is a description being released of Rene Tarrell, described as 5'5, 240 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. She wears glasses. Christopher Wayne Latrelle is 6'2, 150 pounds with blue eyes and tattoos. And the state's Amber Alert website is also releasing a description of the 9-month-old boy, which may be helpful for anyone who sees any of these people. Described as developmentally disabled with a scratch on the right side of his face and a rug burn on the back of the neck.</p><p>Now you are looking at the crime scene taking place in Henderson, Kentucky. But again, now police are also focusing on Illinois. And they say the couple may have family in Evansville, Kentucky, as well as Fort Wayne, Indiana. So, an Amber Alert for the baby and they are asking folks in all of those neighboring states to keep an eye out for this couple and the 9-month-old baby.</p><p>HARRIS: And Fredricka, we've been following this for a couple of days. Do we have a phone number for folks who -- because we need help on this, obviously. Is there a phone number that we can find, maybe we can get it when we come back to you again for an update?</p><p>WHITFIELD: I think I'm going to try and get that phone number for you and then bring it to you. Right now all I have is some information that, you know, folks want to get any more information, they can perhaps go to our website, CNN.com and get more information on the case. And in the meantime, I'm going to try to get a phone number for you. So that next time that I'm able to give you some information that might be a lot more helpful as well.</p><p>HARRIS: We need to solve this. OK, Fred, appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>COLLINS: China may be the key to reigning in North Korea, but how far is Beijing willing to go? CNN's Kathleen Koch has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China, the world's most populous country and North Korea's ally against the U.S. in the Korean War -- but since North Korea's economy collapsed, China has provided most of its food and energy.</p><p>Foreign policy experts say that gives it powerful leverage it has used before, and could now, though the rest of the world may never know about it.</p><p>BATES GILL, FREEMAN CHAIR IN CHINA STUDIES, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: In the past, China has been willing to shut off some of its energy shipments to North Korea for short periods to express their unhappiness with Pyongyang. So, they are capable of doing these things, but they will do it in a very quiet and nonpublic way.</p><p>KOCH: Hence, say longtime diplomats, China's initial declaration after the sanctions vote that it wouldn't check cargo bound for North Korea, followed the next day by quietly beginning inspections at a major border crossing, a face-saving gesture for its neighbor.</p><p>GOV. BILL RICHARDSON (D), NEW MEXICO: By nature, foreign policy- wise, China is a very cautious country. So, this is why, on the sanctions, they are kind of being coy.</p><p>KOCH: So, what does China want? To keep Kim Jong Il, a known quantity, in power.</p><p>PETER BROOKES, SENIOR FELLOW, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: The stability in North Korea, despite as bad as their behavior, is better than a failed state, than civil war, than chaos, then refugee flows into China.</p><p>KOCH: Chaos in the forms of millions of refugees pouring into China and uncertainty over who is in control of North Korea's nuclear weapons.</p><p>With Kim Jong Il, China maintains some influence on a peninsula where the U.S. and its 50,000 troops are already a powerful presence. Its relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and key to its future in the global community, is another factor in China's actions.</p><p>BROOKES: It is very important, because the United States is a country that probably could get in the way -- in the way, the most, of China's ambitions.</p><p>GILL: It's a delicate balancing act for them. And they don't want the United States to take unilateral action, or to try and achieve a solution on the Korean Peninsula that would be principally in American interests.</p><p>KOCH (on camera): So, experts predict China will continue walking a tightrope in the North Korean nuclear crisis...</p><p>(voice-over): ... tightening the screws on its neighbor enough, but not too much, and working closely with the United States and other nations as a team player in the six-party talks, while, all the while, advancing and protecting its own interests first.</p><p>Kathleen Koch, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: You can see more of Kathleen Koch's reports on \"PAULA ZAHN NOW,\" weeknights at 8:00 Eastern, 5:00 Pacific.</p><p>HARRIS: Middle class issues in middle America.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR: The people who are really doing well in this country are the very wealthy people, and not the working middle class. That's slipping.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: In a new CNN poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation, a majority of the Americans say the American dream has become the impossible dream for most people. Those with no college degree have lost faith in the American dream. College graduates still believe, but only about 30 percent of Americans have finished college. There's a lot of middle class frustration out there, and it's focused on Washington. Even Republicans are running against Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN CAMPAIGN AD)</p><p>JOHN STEELE, (R-MD) CANDIDATE FOR SENATE: I know what you're feeling, Washington has no clue what's going on in your life.</p><p>(END CAMPAIGN AD)</p><p>SCHNEIDER: About three-quarters of the public sees Congress as out of touch with average Americans. About the same as in 1994, the last time voters overthrew the majority in Congress. But it's not just Congress. Nearly 80 percent of Americans feel big business has too much influence over the Bush administration. Democrats are nearly unanimous in that sentiment.</p><p>(BEGIN CAMPAIGN AD)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: In Washington, we have a White House that has rolled over for the oil companies.</p><p>(END CAMPAIGN AD)</p><p>SCHNEIDER: As it happens, most Republicans also feel that way, a rare instance of bipartisan agreement.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: The economy, scandals in Washington, trouble overseas. Let's talk more about issues important to voters in the heartland. We have guests from neighboring states this morning. Missouri, a red state that went to President Bush in the last election. Illinois went blue for the Democrats.</p><p>And joining us from St. Louis now, Kenneth Warren. He's a professor of political science at St. Louis University. And joining us from \"The Chicago Tribune\" newsroom, editorial page editor Bruce Dold.</p><p>Bruce, I want to begin with you, if I could. What do people care about in the heartland?</p><p>BRUCE DOLD, \"CHICAGO TRIBUNE\": You know what they care about, they care about the Chicago Bears and Barack Obama.</p><p>COLLINS: OK, Barack Obama.</p><p>DOLD: Bears are 6-0, and Barack is getting a lot of steam going, a lot of people lining up to buy his new back and ask him to run for president. Things are kind of dispiriting beyond that. But he's kind of the one figure that both parties, a lot of people in Illinois are really excited about.</p><p>COLLINS: But they may be excited, Democrats, but what about the Republicans who -- the group of them that may be very discouraged about this upcoming election, and may be sort of thinking about voting Democrat. Do you think Barack Obama is a person that can get that vote to the Democratic side?</p><p>DOLD: We recently asked readers to define what is it to be a liberal or to be a conservative, and we were surprised at how many people on both sides defined it in terms of good and evil. They don't just disagree with the other side, they see the other side as bad people. And Obama does seem to be the one person that's bringing both sides together. They find a lot of hope in him, a lot of spirituality, and -- but beyond that, you see Denny Hastert, the speaker of the House, in a safe seat running radio ads on immigration. He may be getting nervous about his own race. He's certainly worried about losing Henry Hyde's seat to the Democrats. A lot of concern for Republicans here.</p><p>COLLINS: Okay, Kenneth, I want to get to you. Your opinion on what matters in the heartland of America.</p><p>KENNETH WARREN, ST. LOUIS UNIV.: Well, the same thing that's mattering elsewhere in the United States. Missourians are not exactly happy with Bush. Bush's approval ratings are only about 37 percent. And so Missourians are worrying about the war on terrorism. They're worrying about the outcome of Iraq and our commitment to Iraq. And they're also worrying about, despite, by the way, the 12,000 mark for the Dow, they're worrying about their jobs, they are worrying about outsourcing that have cost Missourians jobs. And they are worrying about losing benefits and so forth.</p><p>So what's plaguing Missourians right now is the political climate that -- where they see the oil companies reporting great profits, but they don't see their own economic future very bright.</p><p>COLLINS: And some would argue the oil business is a business like anything else. But I do want to ask you about something you normally have said, and I think it's interesting -- you say that when the Midwest votes Democratic, then the Dems win. When the Midwest votes Republicans, the Republicans win.</p><p>WARREN: Well, that's because Missouri is really your best barometer state. Many studies have shown that. It's gone with the winners in political elections every single time except 1956 for Adlai Stevenson.</p><p>So, by the way, you refer to Missouri as a red state. Well, it was a red state last time, but it was a blue state in 1992; it was a blue state in 1996. When the political climate is Republican, Missouri will vote Republican. When the climate is Democrat, the Missourians will vote Democrat.</p><p>And I think this year, what you're going to see is probably Missouri voting for McHaskell (ph), for instance. She's ahead slightly in the polls. I think she probably will win, because it's not because Talent has been a bad senator. I think he's served Missouri very well. The problem is, though, he's going to be a victim of circumstances, and that circumstance is a very poor Republican climate.</p><p>COLLINS: All right, Bruce, I want to get back to you. How much of this, though is really about getting the vote out? I mean, isn't it true that something like 40 percent to 60 percent of Americans are not voting? Are people going to go and vote this time around?</p><p>DOLD: I think in these parts it's going to be very, very difficult year to get much of a turnout, because it's such a dispiriting election. And Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S. attorney, is all over city hall in Chicago, all over Cook County, and there's scandal in the state legislature in Springfield. And yet the cesspool in Washington seems to be trumping the cesspool in Chicago. And people look all around that, and they don't see many alternatives. So we could see an historic low turnout, even in Chicago where the Democratic machine is used to being able to get out a pretty good vote.</p><p>COLLINS: It's interesting. To me it seems if people are dissatisfied seemingly with both sides as a whole, that that would really get the vote out. But then you've to have somebody on the ballot that can do that.</p><p>Your thoughts, Ken, on who that person could be.</p><p>WARREN: Well, the fact is, is that polls have shown the Democrats are more motivated this year to turnout, just like Republicans were in 1994. But polls are also showing that Republicans are not as motivated to turnout, because they're not excited about what has happened with the Bush administration. So this will definitely benefit Democrats this year, just like the Republicans were benefited in 1994 when the fortunes for the Democrats were not very bright.</p><p>And I think this will suppress the vote among Republicans, and this is the big worry, not that the Republicans will vote Democrat, because of the disillusion with the Bush administration and elsewhere in the Midwest, but it's just that the Republicans decide not to come out and vote.</p><p>COLLINS: All right, we're going to have to end it there for now. Midterm elections about three weeks away, gentlemen. We appreciate your time here.</p><p>Kenneth Warren, St. Louis University, and Bruce Dold from \"The Chicago Tribune,\" Thank you so much.</p><p>Housing, health care, education and out-of-touch politicians.

That's next in the NEWSROOM.</p><p>HARRIS: Nine soldiers, one Marine, the latest Americans killed in Iraq this deadly October. The military announced today four of the soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing west of Baghdad Tuesday. Less than three hours after that attack, another soldier died when his patrol was hit with small-arms fire in northern Baghdad.</p><p>Later, a sixth soldier died in a roadside bombing north of the capital. Meanwhile in Diyala province, three Task Force Lightning soldiers died as a result of enemy action during operations there. And in Anbar province, a Marine died from wounds due to enemy action. That makes 65 U.S. troops killed this month, putting October on track to become one of the deadliest months for American forces since the start of the war. So is this civil war or not?</p><p>CNN's Tom Foreman looks at all sides of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As coalition forces have handed more control to the Iraqi military, insurgents have tested their strength. Violence has spiked. And so have the voices of international affair analysts, saying, now, a civil war is under way.</p><p>The Shia, the largest group of Iraqis, control the east and south. And they are fighting with the minority Sunnis, who control the west, and used to run everything under Saddam. And the Kurds are holding on in the north.</p><p>MAJOR GENERAL DONALD SHEPPERD (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Just, some of it is ethnic hatred, if you will. But it's clearly, in my mind, some type of civil war. We're just afraid to say it.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, the -- I hear a lot of talk about civil war. I -- I'm concerned about that, of course.</p><p>FOREMAN: The administration hesitates to call it civil war, because coalition troops, while under constant fire, are keeping the Iraqi factions from massing soldiers, from gathering large quantities of arms, and launching broad offensives against each other, hallmarks of a classic civil war.</p><p>And, of course, there are political and security considerations.</p><p>(on camera): If full-scale, open civil war erupts, and fractures this fledgling democracy, it will certainly be seen a major defeat for the United States. And Iraq could well turn into a prime, long-term staging ground for terrorism.</p><p>(voice-over): So, why do some Iraqis seem hell-bent on rushing towards civil war? Besides centuries of conflict, there is a modern cause: oil.</p><p>If Iraq can ever stabilize and start pumping its oil at full capacity, it could become a wealthy nation. And no faction wants to see another one grab too much control of that asset.</p><p>SHEPPERD: The problem is, you have got oil in the north. You have got oil in the south. You have no oil in the west, where the Sunnis are.</p><p>FOREMAN: So, as coalition countries seem to be growing weary of the fighting, many Iraqis seem increasingly poised for a showdown on their country's future, whether that's called a civil war or not.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: A little bit lighter story now.

Now they want to make money off it.\u201d But many questions were left unanswered. Among them: How many apps are collecting this data, and what are they doing with it?  Facebook screen\u201cWhile Zuckerberg claimed that even he is not fully aware of everything that happens in the Facebook digital economy, the evidence suggests that health-care information may lead to the next major data-related crisis,\u201d Ostherr wrote. </p><p> \u201cIn early April, MSNBC reported that Facebook recently launched a project based in its secretive \u2018Building 8\u2019 group to get hospitals to share anonymized patient data with them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe project was reportedly put on hold in the wake of the current scandal, but the stated plan was to match hospitals\u2019 patient data on diagnoses and prescription information with Facebook so the company could combine that data with its own to construct digital profiles of patients.  \u201cZuckerberg admitted in his congressional testimony last week that Facebook does collect some medical data from users. Considering the large number of patient-support groups on Facebook that use the site for peer-to-peer health care and social support, there is plenty of medically relevant data to be mined. Membership in some patient groups numbers in the tens of thousands, with average daily posts of several hundred or more.\u201d  Ostherr said a sampling of the types of data that users post include \u201ctests, treatments, surgeries, sex drive, and relationships\u201d on a breast cancer support site. Other data include location and personal profile information such as age, race, sex, educational background, employment and even cellphone numbers. In addition, many posts include photos that can be subjected to facial recognition software.  \u201cIt is not surprising that Facebook wants to move into the digital health market: So do Amazon.com , Google, Apple, Uber and all of the other big tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cThese businesses see an opportunity to profit from users\u2019 personal health data because, unlike narrowly defined medical data, health and wellness data are not considered protected health information and therefore are not protected by privacy laws.  \u201cThese activities could simply be understood as advertising in the age of big data, a practice our society has so far agreed to accept,\u201d Ostherr said. \u201cBut the unique risks from health- and medical-data mining and digital profiling of patients suggest greater stakes worthy of regulatory attention.\u201d  To read Ostherr\u2019s full op-ed, go here.  Ostherr, who is also the Gladys Louise Fox Professor of English at Rice, has a forthcoming book on health and big data, \u201cQuantified Health: Learning From Patient Stories in the Age of Big Data.\u201d  For more information or to schedule an interview with Ostherr, contact David Ruth, director of national media relations at Rice, at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david@rice.edu\">david@rice.edu</email> or 713-348-6327.

The roles will be filled in the autumn, though it is not clear exactly when Arnold will take on his position.\u00a0</p><p>Arnold tells Managing IP: \u201cI am delighted to be appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His departure, however, while prompting lawyers to look back at his time on the High Court benches, leaves a void in the IP division \u2013 which observers have regularly described as being under resourced.</p><p>Pushing the law forward</p><p>Andy Bowler, partner at London firm Bristows, says: \u201cThere is hardly an area of IP for which he hasn\u2019t provided a definitive go-to judgment.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He adds that on supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), Arnold \u201chas strained every sinew\u201d to seek clarity from the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) on a complex area of law.</p><p>As Managing IP reported this month, the High Court \u2013 and in particular Arnold \u2013 has referred more cases on the SPC Regulation to the CJEU than any other European country.</p><p>John Linneker, partner at international firm Fieldfisher, says Arnold is one of the cleverest judges on the bench for IP work.</p><p>He adds: \u201cHe has a reputation for providing quick judgments but also for long and thorough judgments which are of great assistance. All the judgments go through the law and the reasoning for the decision very clearly.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Arnold\u2019s rulings have regularly stretched to more than 100 paragraphs; but, rather than bemoan their length, lawyers have praised the judge for providing a forensic analysis of the issues at play and existing case law.\u00a0</p><p>Simon Baggs, partner at IP firm Wiggin, says he has taken several cases to court where Arnold was the presiding judge.\u00a0</p><p>Most notable of these, he says, included the Cartier v British Telecommunications and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and others v Newzbin cases, which established website blocking as a remedy for trademark and copyright owners respectively.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Baggs says Arnold showed bravery in his decision making and pushed the law forward.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt may seem easier to say today, when there is greater public and political engagement in favour of challenging big tech, but when Arnold was judging the cases there is no doubt that the prevailing view was very different.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen he was judging whether ISPs could be required to do more to protect rights online, he was literally dealing with arguments that the internet would be broken if he decided in favour of rights holders. He saw through these arguments as total nonsense. Not easy and not without controversy, but I respect him hugely for having done so,\u201d Baggs adds.\u00a0</p><p>In an interview with Managing IP last month Arnold said it fell on him by chance to pioneer and develop the remedy of website blocking in the UK.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had no notion that that was what I was going to be doing until it was brought before me. I found myself not so much developing an area of law as creating it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another lawyer says Arnold leaves a rich legacy of first instance decisions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn general, if you want an accurate summary of what the law is, and how it came to be, in any given area of patent law in particular then his judgments are a pretty good place to start,\u201d they say.</p><p>Who takes over?\u00a0</p><p>With Arnold\u2019s promotion there is a vacancy in the High Court for an IP specialist judge. A future promotion for Colin Birss \u2013 another High Court judge \u2013 has also been suggested, meaning another new role could be created.\u00a0</p><p>The lack of IP specialists has been highlighted repeatedly by lawyers as a growing concern in the judiciary and many want to ensure an adequate replacement is found.</p><p>One name that multiple sources suggest is His Honour Richard Hacon, who currently heads the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC).</p><p>Alan Johnson, also of Bristows\u2019 London office, says: \u201cHaving served his time as IPEC judge since Colin Birss was elevated to the Patents Court, and having done such a good job there, surely Hacon is the natural replacement? He has, after all, been sitting regularly as a deputy in any event.\u201d</p><p>Other sources say potential candidates are QCs Richard Meade, Douglas Campbell and Daniel Alexander.\u00a0</p><p>Circuit Judge Melissa Clarke, a former solicitor, has also been named as a potential successor.\u00a0</p><p>The judiciary has yet to respond to a request for comment on the timetable for appointing a successor.</p><p>Baggs adds of Arnold: \u201cHe will leave very big shoes to fill as he moves up to the Court of Appeal \u2013 whoever replaces him needs to be equally willing to be brave. These are tough times online and the law has a huge role to play in shaping protection that is scalable.\u201d</p><p>Arnold, one of the go-to first instance judges for IP, clearly departs with a positive legacy. The challenge will be making sure the void is filled by an equally capable replacement.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>CREDIT: Max Walters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABI-2274890931</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">30314 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVH-60V1-JBWT-B2SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Jul 18, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Managing Intellectual Property</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 09605002</issn><aggregationName>ABI/INFORM</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other (Trade Journals)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002IHB</classCode><className>TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS512110 MOTION PICTURE &amp;

We have created nearly 1,000 jobs in the last three years and have another 120 roles to fill right now.</p><p>We have launched schemes like our SBG CoLab programme - an incubator for tech businesses in the area. And this year we will open our graduate scheme for the fourth year running, helping build up the skills of local young people considering careers in technology.</p><p>So any increase in Remote Gaming Duty is a tax on hi-tech Yorkshire jobs and will clearly have an impact on our plans to create new roles in the North of England in the years to come.</p><p>Because we are based on on-shore here in Yorkshire, our tax burden is already high. Higher indeed than most of our competitors and higher than what we make in profit. Last year we paid \u00a3153m in taxes and made \u00a3146m in profit. </p><p>It is right that we did this - we are a UK-based business and proud of the contribution we make to Yorkshire and the wider UK economy. A contribution by the way, that was worth \u00a3300m in GVA to the regional economy.</p><p>But it can't be right to increase our tax burden even further to pay for a change in regulations that are unrelated to us. Especially when there are other, more equitable ways the government could raise any revenue it may need to cover this shortfall.</p><p>Rather than punishing a UK based job creator, the Government should focus on getting a fairer tax contribution from other tech companies who, unlike us, don't already pay sufficient taxes on their UK activities.</p><p>In the gambling industry the Government levies a tax on the profits we make from our UK based consumers. We have to identify where our customers are based, and if they are in the UK, tax them accordingly. Why can't the Government look to extend this type of taxation to the big tech companies? Surely Google, Facebook and others know where their users are, know where their ads are viewed, and could pay taxes accordingly?</p><p>Or if the Government wants to look only within the gambling industry, then what about closing the loophole that means companies based offshore don't pay VAT on their marketing and other costs? This tax cost Sky Betting &amp; Gaming around \u00a330m last year so extending it to other companies could easily address any shortfall the reduction in FOBT stakes might lead to.</p><p>At Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, we are committed to providing safer gambling, and recognise that regulation plays an important part in ensuring people can gamble safely. We welcome the Government's wider proposals around online safety and the importance of using data to ensure gamblers are protected. We already invest tens of millions of pounds in people, systems and the industry's first ever safer gambling advertising campaign designed to reduce problem gambling in our customer base and we plan to increase this spend.</p><p>To this end, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming has already put forward a four point plan to industry. This includes harnessing technology so we can use customer data to understand player behaviour, and monitor for signs of harm. </p><p>We want to make a concerted effort to interact with customers who show signs of harm, discuss their gambling behaviour with them, and present details of their behaviour clearly. Finally, we will want to increase our interventions with customers to stop them harming themselves in the most extreme cases.</p><p>We look forward to working with the Government and industry going forward to continue to build a safer more responsible gambling industry fit for the 21st century. However, Ministers need to think through the implications of further tax increases online, or risk unintended consequences which would damage our local economy. </p><p>Otherwise this will be another measure from Government that makes people think twice about their support for the Northern Powerhouse in general, and Yorkshire in particular. </p><p>Richard Flint is chief executive of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YOPOST-D8556A0BB5F14CBEAA383C075C708750ASH99654237NLYP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YOPOST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBW-WSV1-F15K-22BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">250237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yorkshire Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 18, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Columnists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economy business and finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economic sector</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>tourism and leisure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>casino and gambling</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>regions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yorkshire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>towns and cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Leeds</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

We have created nearly 1,000 jobs in the last three years and have another 120 roles to fill right now.</p><p>We have launched schemes like our SBG CoLab programme - an incubator for tech businesses in the area. And this year we will open our graduate scheme for the fourth year running, helping build up the skills of local young people considering careers in technology.</p><p>So any increase in Remote Gaming Duty is a tax on hi-tech Yorkshire jobs and will clearly have an impact on our plans to create new roles in the North of England in the years to come.</p><p>Because we are based on on-shore here in Yorkshire, our tax burden is already high. Higher indeed than most of our competitors and higher than what we make in profit. Last year we paid \u00a3153m in taxes and made \u00a3146m in profit. </p><p>It is right that we did this - we are a UK-based business and proud of the contribution we make to Yorkshire and the wider UK economy. A contribution by the way, that was worth \u00a3300m in GVA to the regional economy.</p><p>But it can't be right to increase our tax burden even further to pay for a change in regulations that are unrelated to us. Especially when there are other, more equitable ways the government could raise any revenue it may need to cover this shortfall.</p><p>Rather than punishing a UK based job creator, the Government should focus on getting a fairer tax contribution from other tech companies who, unlike us, don't already pay sufficient taxes on their UK activities.</p><p>In the gambling industry the Government levies a tax on the profits we make from our UK based consumers. We have to identify where our customers are based, and if they are in the UK, tax them accordingly. Why can't the Government look to extend this type of taxation to the big tech companies? Surely Google, Facebook and others know where their users are, know where their ads are viewed, and could pay taxes accordingly?</p><p>Or if the Government wants to look only within the gambling industry, then what about closing the loophole that means companies based offshore don't pay VAT on their marketing and other costs? This tax cost Sky Betting &amp; Gaming around \u00a330m last year so extending it to other companies could easily address any shortfall the reduction in FOBT stakes might lead to.</p><p>At Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, we are committed to providing safer gambling, and recognise that regulation plays an important part in ensuring people can gamble safely. We welcome the Government's wider proposals around online safety and the importance of using data to ensure gamblers are protected. We already invest tens of millions of pounds in people, systems and the industry's first ever safer gambling advertising campaign designed to reduce problem gambling in our customer base and we plan to increase this spend.</p><p>To this end, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming has already put forward a four point plan to industry. This includes harnessing technology so we can use customer data to understand player behaviour, and monitor for signs of harm. </p><p>We want to make a concerted effort to interact with customers who show signs of harm, discuss their gambling behaviour with them, and present details of their behaviour clearly. Finally, we will want to increase our interventions with customers to stop them harming themselves in the most extreme cases.</p><p>We look forward to working with the Government and industry going forward to continue to build a safer more responsible gambling industry fit for the 21st century. However, Ministers need to think through the implications of further tax increases online, or risk unintended consequences which would damage our local economy. </p><p>Otherwise this will be another measure from Government that makes people think twice about their support for the Northern Powerhouse in general, and Yorkshire in particular. </p><p>Richard Flint is chief executive of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YEPST-D8556A0BB5F14CBEAA383C075C708750ASH99654237NLEP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YEPST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBW-WSV1-F15K-2272-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252816</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yorkshire Evening Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61414\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 18, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Columnists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economy business and finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economic sector</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>tourism and leisure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>casino and gambling</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>regions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yorkshire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>towns and cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Leeds</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Also  with us for the hour, he is Erik Nielsen and he is Unicredit Group Chief  Economist.</p><p> So, Erik, thank you so much.  Stay there, because we'll get to you in a  second.</p><p> Richard, when it comes to the tech selloff -- </p><p> RICHARD WINDSOR, FOUNDER, RADIO FREE MOBILE:  Good morning.</p><p> LACQUA:  -- what exactly -- good morning to you -- what exactly freaked the  markets?  Is it that, you know, had a trajectory, where a lot of these  stocks were going when you were driverless cars could go now next and now  it's all hanging up in the air?</p><p> WINDSOR:  No, I think you got a number of factors.  I mean you've had the  really large -- the really tech companies that have had, you know, one of  the greatest runs they've ever had.  You've got the prospect of increasing  interest rates.</p><p> And then also, if you look at the stocks that are dependent on monetization  of user data like Google and Facebook and Twitter, these are the ones that  have most impacted.  So I suspect it's more about these factors, combined  with increasing fear of regulation in terms of what people can and cannot  do with data that has been given to them by users that are causing the  problems.</p><p> LACQUA:  Yes, we also heard that the E.U. was probably considering a  digital tax as a trade to this few (ph) kind of rages on.  What would that  look like?</p><p> WINDSOR:  Great question.  Very difficult to tell, I mean, I guess what  they would look to do would be to impose a tax on revenues that have been  derived in the region.  That would be the simplest way of doing it as I  presume.</p><p> But overall, I mean, my personal opinion is hold data issue is it will  eventually blow over.  And the reason why it will blow over is because  there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my opinion in terms of how the  internet works and users seem to have the opinion that the internet is  free, isn't and never has been.  What you're actually doing is just paying  for service with personal data.</p><p> Once users get more accustomed to that, then I think that there will be an  easier situation where you can choose.  You pay the cash or you pay with  personal data, and that's how I think it's going to evolve going forward.</p><p> GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Do you value these companies though at the  same level if that is the case?  Because, as you say, at the moment, there  is this misapprehension that the service is free.  But basically these are  data monetization companies.</p><p> WINDSOR:  Exactly.  And actually, I think it is.  As a matter of fact, the  research that Radio Free Mobile has done over the last five years actually  (INAUDIBLE) this out, which is that, you know, you have a choice.  Let's  just take for example, Google.  Google has a choice.  You could basically  come to Google and say yes, you can use my personal data and I will use --  get your services for free or I don't want you to use my personal data,  I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $5 a month for the service.</p><p> Now, obviously, these companies would set the pricing of that service at  the level at which there should be no real impact on revenue overall.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Do you think there's a breakup risk here, Richard?</p><p> WINDSOR:  In terms of?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Are these companies too big, too powerful, somebody pointed out  to me earlier on, they spend a huge amount of money in terms of lobbying in  Washington.  They control huge sways (ph) of the technology sector across  the United States and across the world.  We've seen it in history, when  companies and sectors become too big, there is a regulatory impetus that  starts but ultimately ends up leading to breakup.</p><p> WINDSOR:  I think it's this possibility, but it's a very distinct  possibility.  If you look at Google, your first question want to ask is,  well, what am I going to break it up into?  Because, you know, and there is  a reasonable argument in this level of Google that it is a one-trick pony,  but it does search and everything else is fairly minor.</p><p> As a result of that, you would have great difficulty breaking that up into  its constituent parts.  In the same, you could level exactly the same  accusation at Facebook.  Facebook generates almost all of its revenue off  its social network, so the question is, what would you break it up into?</p><p> LACQUA:  Let's also bring Erik Nielsen of Unicredit into the conversation.   Erik, I know you don't look at this thing day out, but you must have a view  on driverless cars and automation and even the end of cash, and the impact  it has on the economy in 5, 10, 15 years.  Does anything that happens in  the last, you know, the last couple of days change that deal?</p><p> ERIK NIELSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT GROUP:  I'm getting more and more  nervous.  I think we had maybe an overshot in terms of globalization after  the crisis and through the crisis sort of extent and I see a lot of winding  back of this.  And I think what you're referring to and what we just talked  about on the -- in the I.T. industry and the tech industries.  I share sort  of guy sort of skepticism here.</p><p> I mean, to some extent, these companies have been broken up in the sense  that they're not free to operate in China and Russia, for example, right?   There are positive words that we don't want this, right, and all the  Europeans are saying a little bit, I don't really think you pay enough  taxes because you shoveling through islands, so maybe, so we should say  exactly as Richard said, maybe we should tax the pays with the revenues  come in.</p><p> But this whole thing is not a smooth process, right?  So you have to worry  a little about this sort of how that impacts the economy in a negative way.</p><p> JOHNSON:  But we find ourselves in a situation where the Chinese, as long  as you got -- they two sort of two buckets of tech stocks around the world  at the moment, you got the kind of the U.S. bucket and you got the Asian  bucket, which is largely the Chinese buckets.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Europe doesn't have much.</p><p> NIELSEN:  No.</p><p> JOHNSON:  So it kind of falls into one of those two.  The Chinese bucket is  going to be made up of companies that are going to get bigger and,  therefore, potentially stronger, whereas there is increasingly this  regulatory taxation burden that is likely to be put on the U.S. once.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p> JOHNSON:  So are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage -- are we heading  down the road of a kind of trade war their tech versus our tech?  Are we  putting ourselves at a disadvantage?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I don't know if we -- yes, from a very sort of liberal kind of  world view we are, in a sense, but I think what we have seen is some of the  backlash to what's this in the (INAUDIBLE) of things and (INAUDIBLE) now  where these companies seems to be if the reporting is correct, meddling  with the political process.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  So then I think most people will think, well, then there has to  be some measures to take this back, right?  So I -- and that's what I meant  by what I said before.  I don't think that taking it, but I think  politically, it's understandable and probably desirable, but it's not  smooth for the economy as this happens.</p><p> LACQUA:  And, Richard, what are you watching out for in the next 74 hours?   Will it be testimonies to kind of exactly understand where a lot of these  big companies go from here?</p><p> WINDSOR:  My personal suspicion is that things are -- that, you know, you  had a bit of fuzz.  People start to get worried about the use of data.   Obviously, actually and if you look at the data leak, there is piece of  happen where at 50, I think it was 50 million accountable data and 50  million of Facebook accounts made it into a private data analysis firm.</p><p> If you actually look at Facebook has actually changed its policy so you can  no longer do that.  So what I suspect will actually happen is there's going  to be talk, a bit of softness, but I, you know, I think at the end of the  day, we're coming into earnings season.  Quite possibly, we're going to  have another reason a good season from the big tech companies.</p><p> So as a result of that, I suspect a small correction, but then, you know,  continuation of business as normal, at least for another quarter or so.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, Richard, thank you so much.  Richard Windsor there,  founder of Radio Free Mobile and Erik Nielsen of Unicredit stays with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Erik Nielsen still with us from Unicredit.  Erik, where's the  tipping point in this story?  The Chinese and we've -- we saw this sort of  18 months ago with the Davos speech that was delivered by the Chinese  premier, have tried to play sort of the calm, rational actor in this story,  but you just kind of wonder where they are being pushed to and at what  point they start to retaliate, because that's when the game really starts.   Where do you think that point is?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I don't know, but I think there are a couple of things going on,  right?  The one part is that it's I think it's an irony that China is now  the defender of free trade, right?  At the end of the day, they have a lot  of subsidized industries -- </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  -- and all the rest of it, and so the real tragedy for me here is  that these are the protector of the (INAUDIBLE) lateral world have decided  that they don't want to be, as the U.S., they don't want to really be the  free trade champion anymore.</p><p> So, now, we are in this back room and ironically somebody getting sort of - - </p><p> JOHNSON:  They fills it.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Job filling in, exactly, in a peculiar way.  But where do this --  where do they draw the lines?  It's impossible to say, because it's a big  political decision for them at the end of the day.  They have to do  something, but I suspect they will retaliate very modestly, because they  don't want I say the exactly -- </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  -- they don't want the trade war.</p><p> JOHNSON:  In some ways, this feels very much like how we used to think  about the cold war, escalation theory, deterrence.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  That kind of the language.  Is that the direction we're going in,  and is that a useful sort of way of thinking about this?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Well, I think July (ph) -- I mean, let me start by saying, I  think you could -- we haven't named it yet, but I think we already are in  Cold War II, but more with Russia, right it's in a sense.  And politically,  this is completely cold war stuff we're going through now, and it can -- I  don't see the breaking point there to where we stop this sort of escalation  on the political side between.  But this time around, compared to the  original cold war, we have now China being a major player and the leading  western (ph) power not being a leading player.  So this is confusing,  right.</p><p> LACQUA:  But Erik, you have American businessmen who basically yesterday  said, look, $60 billion it will also hurt the U.S. economy.  How can you  quantify that?  Do we know by how much?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Not at the top of my head.  It's very, very little, I mean, if  you're -- I mean, look, if you're doing the trade tariffs and you do sort  of the steel and aluminum and you do a $60 billion on top of that, it is a  decimal point on GDP at most, right.  But the question is, if the Chinese  retaliate and it comes back and forth a couple of times, well, then  suddenly it could be.</p><p> There was a study by Obstfeld the IMF Chief Economist some years ago that  estimates it that if you planted 20% tax -- import tax in America I think  it was, on all Chinese imports, you could have something like half a  percent cut to U.S. GDP by the exchange rate.</p><p> LACQUA:  How would China retaliate?  So even if they don't, you know, throw  the fire on the other side, can they retaliate in measures that we don't  really notice, but put investment in Europe?  Is there actually -- can  Europe benefit from this?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, I mean, it's all I was going to say, if the (INAUDIBLE) of  course, how can they retaliate?  I hope they retaliate just like they try  to smooth Trump by maybe revoking some of the licenses for his daughters  back in China or something, very symbolic, very sort of tell him you don't  like what we do.</p><p> But the most serious question you ask, yes, I'm sure Europe can benefit  instead and I think already, as I understand the conversations between  particular Berlin and Beijing are in full flow on this.  How can we at  least prevent that we get down on the slippery slope to watch each other?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Does the Trump camp see that as being Europe ending up in China's  camp?  Europe is trying to figure out how it gets around the aluminum and  steel tariffs.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  If the White House perceives that the negotiations are in full  flow and the Chinese and the Europeans are negotiating.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Does that isolate Washington even further?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, it does.  I mean, it's the -- I forget who coined it, I  mean, from America first (INAUDIBLE) alone, right.  I mean, that idea then  it's the problem is I don't know, but I -- my suspect that Trump and Ross  (ph) and these people are don't really see things the same way we see them.   They say, well, people are just being confused.  The \"F.T.\" is up yesterday  is saying that it's very -- calling some Europeans, it's very difficult,  because he's so unpredictable Trump.  I suspect if Trump reads the \"F.T.\"  which should probably doesn't, he would say, that's good, that's what I'm  messing around with them, right?  And -- but this is strange.  It's not  good for the economy</p><p> LACQUA:  I mean, it could be seen as a win for the (INAUDIBLE).  I know  whether he reads the \"F.T.\", but I know he's watching, so I'm sure he's  listening right now.</p><p> We'll get back to Erik shortly.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  Well, still with us is Erik Nielsen of Unicredit.  Erik, how does  this translate into your world?  Do you have the currency angle?  Of you  course you haven't said your angle, angle.  Do you worry a little bit less  about Saudi Arabia in terms of finances than you maybe did six, eight  months ago because of the old price?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, for sure.  Right.  I mean there's -- I worry over less about  them for two reasons.  The oil price as you said and the fact that it feels  like they're to reform and becoming closer to the west and reform the  economy, which haven't been done.  Whether they would be successful, I  would -- I don't know, right.  One has to be skipped but certainly a high  oil price and this sort of stabilization is good.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  What does that mean?  I mean the oil price, what is the  metric when you look at the oil price inflation?  Does it feed through  inflation in the U.S.?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, yes, it does and that's best, right.  I mean that's best and  very clear.  By you can say we've been asking for more inflation in America  and Europe for a long time.  We don't want inflation as cost push right.  I  mean, because oil prices go up.</p><p> That's bad inflation.  Its -- we want inflation because the output closes  and therefore demand push inflation higher, right.  That's the -- that's  what we really want.  But what I meant by good news is that also in it for  the west, you need a stable Middle East.  And forever stay in Middle East  you need oil prices and solar (ph) maybe this (INAUDIBLE) at least north of  50 probably.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Talking inflation, we just had U.K. CPI drop and maybe the wrong  kind of inflation, because it's been driven by what's been happening with  the pound.  The data just came out a few minutes ago.  The pound popping  around a little bit on it.</p><p> I'm just going to my (INAUDIBLE) screen.  The number going through at 2.7.   Previously it was 3.0.  It was surveyed to come through at 2.8.  It's now  come down to 2.7.</p><p> We do have a bank of England decision coming up in a few days' time.  It's  going to be interesting to see ultimately whether or not actually the  markets price in the bank right in terms of the, A, the inflation  expectations, and B, whether or not that isn't likely to lead to an ongoing  rate hiking cycle.  We'll see.  We'll find out later on this week.  Marconi  is going to tell us.</p><p> LACQUA:  Yes.  And Erik would you bring over to my chart.  Now this is  basically, we're looking at DWI (ph) repeat function, we're also looking at  traders and how much they feel the BOE can act.  Do you feel like they can?   So this is basically showing at least one of BOE rate hikes this year.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> LACQUA:  Can they afford to even hike once?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I wouldn't if I were them.  I think -- but I think they will.  I  mean I think is the -- yes, I think the U.K. economy is too weak, and they  should look through the inflation at this stage.  That would be my view.  I  think its -- but I think they have set themselves in motion that they have  -- they've had the inflation numbers obviously and they've set themselves  in most of it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  No.  No.  The U.K. economy is running at -- it was running  at 17 miles an hour without shaking, right?  The kind of the outputs and it  now running at 60 miles an hour without shaking.  But if we run the economy  60 miles an hour, it starts to shake.  We don't have the same potential  growth rate we used to have.  So the inflation story is a bigger risk  therefore the banks should act earlier, shouldn't it?</p><p> NIELSEN:  If you're running at 60 miles an hour without shaking, maybe so.   I'm looking more at maybe 30 and a lot of shaking.</p><p> JOHNSON:  OK.  (INAUDIBLE) and you're making the point.</p><p> NIELSEN:  But it's -- so I would -- yes, I don't see why you hurry.  I mean  the risk that it faces our control here is not very high.  So I -- Look  lets also (INAUDIBLE) whether the hike ones or not in a year makes no  difference to the economy.  That's just -- I mean the market gets very  excited this thing.</p><p> JOHNSON:  You know --</p><p> NIELSEN:  In real life, 25 basis points at one is not important.</p><p> LACQUA:  You're breaking our heart, Erik.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Oh sorry.</p><p> LACQUA:  Erik Nielsen with Unicredit staying with us.  We'll talk a little  bit more about what the market cares and doesn't care about.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Erik, what are we -- what is (INAUDIBLE) the impact of a cliff  edge on the European E.U. economy after the U.K. leaves if we don't have  the same ago aggregation of financial services in London, the access to  those bit markets, those capital markets, ceases to be there for European  companies.  What is the downsize for Europe?  I'm just trying to understand  how strong a card the U.K. where place it ultimately has to play here.</p><p> NIELSEN:  It's very weak one, right, because it -- the U.K. is small in  this context.  I think there's days from day one, it believes that you  cannot have most of sort of the settlements and the bit --</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  -- on the financial outside the E.U.  So there will be some  pushback on this one.  And there is on this specific issue a degree of also  there's a benefit for us if you will.  I mean there is a -- you can see how  Frankfurt and Paris and Dublin, all other countries and other cities that  sort of stopping to sort of the competing to get the financial industries  in there.  So I -- look, if Brexit is anything but a very soft one, it's a  negative for all of us, little (INAUDIBLE) into my mind about that but more  so for the U.K., right?</p><p> JOHNSON:  So, I agree.  I just wanting about if I run a company (INAUDIBLE)  right funding or sell a bond or whatever it is I need to do.  One of the  things this happen is the financial crisis is that the U.S. capital markets  have become bigger.  One of the things that happened is the financial  crisis is that the European capital markets have become smaller.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Now one of the things that happened after the financial crisis  was that Europe said what we need to do is get deeper capital markets here.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p> JOHNSON:  One of the critical factors for our economy if we're going to  take it forward from here.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  The most obvious thing to do is to use one of the global  financial centers within the time zone to generate that process.  Yet we're  about to see the cliff edge where for removes that for being a possibility.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  But in powered up you have the banking union and the  capitalize (ph) union under construction, if you will.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.  Slow construction.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, yes, exactly.  But its -- I mean, the banking union has -- I  mean from their point of view it's not been slow, but it's, you know, like  a war right now.  But the capitalize union is underway, right?  And the  credit will take some years for sure.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Erik Nielsen of Unicredit sitting alongside us here on the desk.   Erik, so we're just having a little of a chat in the break, and we were  talking about whether or not the fed is going to raise three or four and it  kind of went, and I'm a bit worried about next year.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Should the fed be cutting rates at this point?</p><p> NIELSEN:  No, probably not.  I wouldn't cut rates, but I think if I were a  betting man, I think I would bet on a rate cut towards the end of next  year.  I mean, so people are thinking, how far do they keep going, and  nobody is talking about the cost because I think there's a measure of  probability that next year sees a significant slowdown.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Recession?</p><p> NIELSEN:  You won't get probably a recession like two quarters of negative  growth within 2019, I think.  But when we come into early 2020, very likely  probability (INAUDIBLE) say that's a very high probability and that means  growth will slow almost a year before.  So that sort of a year now  certainly.  And that's when the fed typically stop hiking and then at one  states down the line towards the end of next year, I could easily see them  cut.</p><p> JOHNSON:  So the fed is going to be cutting as the ECB is exiting.  It's  going to be an interesting middle conundrum (INAUDIBLE), isn't it?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.  I think its -- yes, exactly.  And that's why you have  to think Euro-dollar moves higher.</p><p> LACQUA:  But Erik why would you just not hike as much instead of then --  you know, you use credibility.  We've seen it here in Europe about 15 years  ago.  If you hike and then cut, the markets freak out.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  Well, you hike until you don't hike anymore, and then you  wait for maybe six, nine months, and then you cut in the normal scenario,  right?  But I think the probability of -- I mean, and so this is my view of  next year that at least that it's a high probability.  But its -- if I were  the fed, I would also hike now, but I would not say four hikes this year.   I mean, I think what's in it for that?</p><p> LACQUA:  The growth is good.  What would happen in 18 months from now?</p><p> NIELSEN:  So my -- there are two issues.  Pure macro, half of the increase  in private consumption in America has been funded for two years now by a  drawdown in household savings, and they seems to its down 2.5%.  So this is  vulnerable.  This is 70% of GDP in America, right?</p><p> Then you have the risks of policies, the trade stuff, and the fiscal  expansion.  And what does the fiscal expansion do for insurance and they'll  buy to the 10-year?  So, my view would be that there's certainly a risk  that sudden this thing falls off quite measurable at sometime down the  line.</p><p> LACQUA:  What does it mean for -- so who would be hit, is it that?  But  this is regardless of tariffs and trade, or is it?</p><p> NIELSEN:  So the underlying fundamentals would suggest to me that sometime  next year you have a slowdown.  Tariffs and trade raises the risk that it  happens more abruptly and earlier.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Do you think the Euro goes up on this?  I'm sorry, I'm trying to  consider the other argument out, which is --</p><p> LACQUA:  I'm shocked.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- as the fed is -- yes.  Sorry.  And as the fed has been hiking  rates and the interest rate differential on the 10 years go wider and wider  and wider, the dollar has gone down.  So I'm just going to throw it out  there.  Does the dollar go up when the fed starts?</p><p> NIELSEN:  No.  No.  No.  Your --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  But Euro dollar has gone up when the fed is hiking.  They got  this huge interest rate --</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- differential, so --</p><p> NIELSEN:  I don't think that's as powerful as the fiscal expansion.  I  mean, so --</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  -- we had a -- we have a nice -- my colleague (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NIELSEN:  -- has a great chart on the U.S. budget deficit adjusted for the  cyclicals and need (INAUDIBLE) chart --</p><p> JOHNSON:  The Euro has gone up because of the U.S. twin deficit?</p><p> NIELSEN:  No, the dollar has gone down, right?</p><p> JOHNSON:  OK.</p><p> NIELSEN:  And that's probably the --</p><p> JOHNSON:  No.  No.  But its --</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  No.  No.  No.  Because the dollar weakness more than as a  Euro spends dollar.  That's important too.</p><p> LACQUA:  That's not how Draghi is feeling it.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  Yes, yes, exactly and rightly so.  I mean look at the trade  where the Euro has got up by roughly half of what your dollar has right.   So its dollar is dramatic.  But -- </p><p> JOHNSON:  The trade (INAUDIBLE) Euro is down because the (INAUDIBLE) hasn't  moved or --</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  It's been helping that's right, that's right.  I mean, and  I mean the other trading partner we have the sterling, right, and then we  have the central Europeans and all the rest of it, so its, yes, but there  then maybe it's a very big part of the story, right.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right.  This is trade where the Euro, I caught it up in time.</p><p> NIELSEN:  With --</p><p> LACQUA:  I'm so happy.  There it is.  It's there on the left.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p> LACQUA:  Between the --</p><p> NIELSEN:  That's between the Euro Bank.</p><p> LACQUA:  So that --</p><p> NIELSEN:  So what's the problem, right?</p><p> LACQUA:  What do we do from here?</p><p> NIELSEN:  So that's put to my point is first for the ECB what's the  problem, right?</p><p> JOHNSON:  It's gone sideways.  Those on the thin on radio it's gone  sideways.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  So, I think from where does it go from here?  I think it  will -- we will edge higher.  Over this year if I have to -- I mean if I  were basically a betting man, I would say maybe 5% or thereabouts.  Nothing  too dramatic.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Somebody is already complaining about it now.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p> LACQUA:  Explain this.</p><p> NIELSEN:  I mean, yes, they are and yet their export numbers are still  growing faster than global trade and global GDP.  So they're still getting  market shares around the world.  But of course it's nicer too -- if you're  an exporter to have a weaker currency.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Who's at the other day one of the ECB --</p><p> NIELSEN:  And I'll prefer they didn't have, right.

Also with us for the hour, he is Erik Nielsen and he is Unicredit Group Chief Economist.</p><p>So, Erik, thank you so much. Stay there, because we'll get to you in a second.</p><p>Richard, when it comes to the tech selloff --</p><p>RICHARD WINDSOR, FOUNDER, RADIO FREE MOBILE: Good morning.</p><p>LACQUA: -- what exactly -- good morning to you -- what exactly freaked the markets? Is it that, you know, had a trajectory, where a lot of these stocks were going when you were driverless cars could go now next and now it's all hanging up in the air?</p><p>WINDSOR: No, I think you got a number of factors. I mean you've had the really large -- the really tech companies that have had, you know, one of the greatest runs they've ever had. You've got the prospect of increasing interest rates.</p><p>And then also, if you look at the stocks that are dependent on monetization of user data like Google and Facebook and Twitter, these are the ones that have most impacted. So I suspect it's more about these factors, combined with increasing fear of regulation in terms of what people can and cannot do with data that has been given to them by users that are causing the problems.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes, we also heard that the E.U. was probably considering a digital tax as a trade to this few (ph) kind of rages on. What would that look like?</p><p>WINDSOR: Great question. Very difficult to tell, I mean, I guess what they would look to do would be to impose a tax on revenues that have been derived in the region. That would be the simplest way of doing it as I presume.</p><p>But overall, I mean, my personal opinion is hold data issue is it will eventually blow over. And the reason why it will blow over is because there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my opinion in terms of how the internet works and users seem to have the opinion that the internet is free, isn't and never has been. What you're actually doing is just paying for service with personal data.</p><p>Once users get more accustomed to that, then I think that there will be an easier situation where you can choose. You pay the cash or you pay with personal data, and that's how I think it's going to evolve going forward.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Do you value these companies though at the same level if that is the case? Because, as you say, at the moment, there is this misapprehension that the service is free. But basically these are data monetization companies.</p><p>WINDSOR: Exactly. And actually, I think it is. As a matter of fact, the research that Radio Free Mobile has done over the last five years actually (INAUDIBLE) this out, which is that, you know, you have a choice. Let's just take for example, Google. Google has a choice. You could basically come to Google and say yes, you can use my personal data and I will use -- get your services for free or I don't want you to use my personal data, I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $5 a month for the service.</p><p>Now, obviously, these companies would set the pricing of that service at the level at which there should be no real impact on revenue overall.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you think there's a breakup risk here, Richard?</p><p>WINDSOR: In terms of?</p><p>JOHNSON: Are these companies too big, too powerful, somebody pointed out to me earlier on, they spend a huge amount of money in terms of lobbying in Washington. They control huge sways (ph) of the technology sector across the United States and across the world. We've seen it in history, when companies and sectors become too big, there is a regulatory impetus that starts but ultimately ends up leading to breakup.</p><p>WINDSOR: I think it's this possibility, but it's a very distinct possibility. If you look at Google, your first question want to ask is, well, what am I going to break it up into? Because, you know, and there is a reasonable argument in this level of Google that it is a one-trick pony, but it does search and everything else is fairly minor.</p><p>As a result of that, you would have great difficulty breaking that up into its constituent parts. In the same, you could level exactly the same accusation at Facebook. Facebook generates almost all of its revenue off its social network, so the question is, what would you break it up into?</p><p>LACQUA: Let's also bring Erik Nielsen of Unicredit into the conversation. Erik, I know you don't look at this thing day out, but you must have a view on driverless cars and automation and even the end of cash, and the impact it has on the economy in 5, 10, 15 years. Does anything that happens in the last, you know, the last couple of days change that deal?</p><p>ERIK NIELSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT GROUP: I'm getting more and more nervous. I think we had maybe an overshot in terms of globalization after the crisis and through the crisis sort of extent and I see a lot of winding back of this. And I think what you're referring to and what we just talked about on the -- in the I.T. industry and the tech industries. I share sort of guy sort of skepticism here.</p><p>I mean, to some extent, these companies have been broken up in the sense that they're not free to operate in China and Russia, for example, right? There are positive words that we don't want this, right, and all the Europeans are saying a little bit, I don't really think you pay enough taxes because you shoveling through islands, so maybe, so we should say exactly as Richard said, maybe we should tax the pays with the revenues come in.</p><p>But this whole thing is not a smooth process, right? So you have to worry a little about this sort of how that impacts the economy in a negative way.</p><p>JOHNSON: But we find ourselves in a situation where the Chinese, as long as you got -- they two sort of two buckets of tech stocks around the world at the moment, you got the kind of the U.S. bucket and you got the Asian bucket, which is largely the Chinese buckets.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Europe doesn't have much.</p><p>NIELSEN: No.</p><p>JOHNSON: So it kind of falls into one of those two. The Chinese bucket is going to be made up of companies that are going to get bigger and, therefore, potentially stronger, whereas there is increasingly this regulatory taxation burden that is likely to be put on the U.S. once.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: So are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage -- are we heading down the road of a kind of trade war their tech versus our tech? Are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage?</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't know if we -- yes, from a very sort of liberal kind of world view we are, in a sense, but I think what we have seen is some of the backlash to what's this in the (INAUDIBLE) of things and (INAUDIBLE) now where these companies seems to be if the reporting is correct, meddling with the political process.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: So then I think most people will think, well, then there has to be some measures to take this back, right? So I -- and that's what I meant by what I said before. I don't think that taking it, but I think politically, it's understandable and probably desirable, but it's not smooth for the economy as this happens.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Richard, what are you watching out for in the next 74 hours? Will it be testimonies to kind of exactly understand where a lot of these big companies go from here?</p><p>WINDSOR: My personal suspicion is that things are -- that, you know, you had a bit of fuzz. People start to get worried about the use of data. Obviously, actually and if you look at the data leak, there is piece of happen where at 50, I think it was 50 million accountable data and 50 million of Facebook accounts made it into a private data analysis firm.</p><p>If you actually look at Facebook has actually changed its policy so you can no longer do that. So what I suspect will actually happen is there's going to be talk, a bit of softness, but I, you know, I think at the end of the day, we're coming into earnings season. Quite possibly, we're going to have another reason a good season from the big tech companies.</p><p>So as a result of that, I suspect a small correction, but then, you know, continuation of business as normal, at least for another quarter or so.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Richard, thank you so much. Richard Windsor there, founder of Radio Free Mobile and Erik Nielsen of Unicredit stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik Nielsen still with us from Unicredit. Erik, where's the tipping point in this story? The Chinese and we've -- we saw this sort of 18 months ago with the Davos speech that was delivered by the Chinese premier, have tried to play sort of the calm, rational actor in this story, but you just kind of wonder where they are being pushed to and at what point they start to retaliate, because that's when the game really starts. Where do you think that point is?</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't know, but I think there are a couple of things going on, right? The one part is that it's I think it's an irony that China is now the defender of free trade, right? At the end of the day, they have a lot of subsidized industries --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- and all the rest of it, and so the real tragedy for me here is that these are the protector of the (INAUDIBLE) lateral world have decided that they don't want to be, as the U.S., they don't want to really be the free trade champion anymore.</p><p>So, now, we are in this back room and ironically somebody getting sort of - -</p><p>JOHNSON: They fills it.</p><p>NIELSEN: Job filling in, exactly, in a peculiar way. But where do this -- where do they draw the lines? It's impossible to say, because it's a big political decision for them at the end of the day. They have to do something, but I suspect they will retaliate very modestly, because they don't want I say the exactly --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- they don't want the trade war.</p><p>JOHNSON: In some ways, this feels very much like how we used to think about the cold war, escalation theory, deterrence.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: That kind of the language. Is that the direction we're going in, and is that a useful sort of way of thinking about this?</p><p>NIELSEN: Well, I think July (ph) -- I mean, let me start by saying, I think you could -- we haven't named it yet, but I think we already are in Cold War II, but more with Russia, right it's in a sense. And politically, this is completely cold war stuff we're going through now, and it can -- I don't see the breaking point there to where we stop this sort of escalation on the political side between. But this time around, compared to the original cold war, we have now China being a major player and the leading western (ph) power not being a leading player. So this is confusing, right.</p><p>LACQUA: But Erik, you have American businessmen who basically yesterday said, look, $60 billion it will also hurt the U.S. economy. How can you quantify that? Do we know by how much?</p><p>NIELSEN: Not at the top of my head. It's very, very little, I mean, if you're -- I mean, look, if you're doing the trade tariffs and you do sort of the steel and aluminum and you do a $60 billion on top of that, it is a decimal point on GDP at most, right. But the question is, if the Chinese retaliate and it comes back and forth a couple of times, well, then suddenly it could be.</p><p>There was a study by Obstfeld the IMF Chief Economist some years ago that estimates it that if you planted 20% tax -- import tax in America I think it was, on all Chinese imports, you could have something like half a percent cut to U.S. GDP by the exchange rate.</p><p>LACQUA: How would China retaliate? So even if they don't, you know, throw the fire on the other side, can they retaliate in measures that we don't really notice, but put investment in Europe? Is there actually -- can Europe benefit from this?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, I mean, it's all I was going to say, if the (INAUDIBLE) of course, how can they retaliate? I hope they retaliate just like they try to smooth Trump by maybe revoking some of the licenses for his daughters back in China or something, very symbolic, very sort of tell him you don't like what we do.</p><p>But the most serious question you ask, yes, I'm sure Europe can benefit instead and I think already, as I understand the conversations between particular Berlin and Beijing are in full flow on this. How can we at least prevent that we get down on the slippery slope to watch each other?</p><p>JOHNSON: Does the Trump camp see that as being Europe ending up in China's camp? Europe is trying to figure out how it gets around the aluminum and steel tariffs.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: If the White House perceives that the negotiations are in full flow and the Chinese and the Europeans are negotiating.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Does that isolate Washington even further?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, it does. I mean, it's the -- I forget who coined it, I mean, from America first (INAUDIBLE) alone, right. I mean, that idea then it's the problem is I don't know, but I -- my suspect that Trump and Ross (ph) and these people are don't really see things the same way we see them. They say, well, people are just being confused. The \"F.T.\" is up yesterday is saying that it's very -- calling some Europeans, it's very difficult, because he's so unpredictable Trump. I suspect if Trump reads the \"F.T.\" which should probably doesn't, he would say, that's good, that's what I'm messing around with them, right? And -- but this is strange. It's not good for the economy</p><p>LACQUA: I mean, it could be seen as a win for the (INAUDIBLE). I know whether he reads the \"F.T.\", but I know he's watching, so I'm sure he's listening right now.</p><p>We'll get back to Erik shortly.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us is Erik Nielsen of Unicredit. Erik, how does this translate into your world? Do you have the currency angle? Of you course you haven't said your angle, angle. Do you worry a little bit less about Saudi Arabia in terms of finances than you maybe did six, eight months ago because of the old price?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, for sure. Right. I mean there's -- I worry over less about them for two reasons. The oil price as you said and the fact that it feels like they're to reform and becoming closer to the west and reform the economy, which haven't been done. Whether they would be successful, I would -- I don't know, right. One has to be skipped but certainly a high oil price and this sort of stabilization is good.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. What does that mean? I mean the oil price, what is the metric when you look at the oil price inflation? Does it feed through inflation in the U.S.?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes, it does and that's best, right. I mean that's best and very clear. By you can say we've been asking for more inflation in America and Europe for a long time. We don't want inflation as cost push right. I mean, because oil prices go up.</p><p>That's bad inflation. Its -- we want inflation because the output closes and therefore demand push inflation higher, right. That's the -- that's what we really want. But what I meant by good news is that also in it for the west, you need a stable Middle East. And forever stay in Middle East you need oil prices and solar (ph) maybe this (INAUDIBLE) at least north of 50 probably.</p><p>JOHNSON: Talking inflation, we just had U.K. CPI drop and maybe the wrong kind of inflation, because it's been driven by what's been happening with the pound. The data just came out a few minutes ago. The pound popping around a little bit on it.</p><p>I'm just going to my (INAUDIBLE) screen. The number going through at 2.7. Previously it was 3.0. It was surveyed to come through at 2.8. It's now come down to 2.7.</p><p>We do have a bank of England decision coming up in a few days' time. It's going to be interesting to see ultimately whether or not actually the markets price in the bank right in terms of the, A, the inflation expectations, and B, whether or not that isn't likely to lead to an ongoing rate hiking cycle. We'll see. We'll find out later on this week. Marconi is going to tell us.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And Erik would you bring over to my chart. Now this is basically, we're looking at DWI (ph) repeat function, we're also looking at traders and how much they feel the BOE can act. Do you feel like they can? So this is basically showing at least one of BOE rate hikes this year.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Can they afford to even hike once?</p><p>NIELSEN: I wouldn't if I were them. I think -- but I think they will. I mean I think is the -- yes, I think the U.K. economy is too weak, and they should look through the inflation at this stage. That would be my view. I think its -- but I think they have set themselves in motion that they have -- they've had the inflation numbers obviously and they've set themselves in most of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON: No. No. No. The U.K. economy is running at -- it was running at 17 miles an hour without shaking, right? The kind of the outputs and it now running at 60 miles an hour without shaking. But if we run the economy 60 miles an hour, it starts to shake. We don't have the same potential growth rate we used to have. So the inflation story is a bigger risk therefore the banks should act earlier, shouldn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN: If you're running at 60 miles an hour without shaking, maybe so. I'm looking more at maybe 30 and a lot of shaking.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. (INAUDIBLE) and you're making the point.</p><p>NIELSEN: But it's -- so I would -- yes, I don't see why you hurry. I mean the risk that it faces our control here is not very high. So I -- Look lets also (INAUDIBLE) whether the hike ones or not in a year makes no difference to the economy. That's just -- I mean the market gets very excited this thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: You know --</p><p>NIELSEN: In real life, 25 basis points at one is not important.</p><p>LACQUA: You're breaking our heart, Erik.</p><p>NIELSEN: Oh sorry.</p><p>LACQUA: Erik Nielsen with Unicredit staying with us. We'll talk a little bit more about what the market cares and doesn't care about.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik, what are we -- what is (INAUDIBLE) the impact of a cliff edge on the European E.U. economy after the U.K. leaves if we don't have the same ago aggregation of financial services in London, the access to those bit markets, those capital markets, ceases to be there for European companies. What is the downsize for Europe? I'm just trying to understand how strong a card the U.K. where place it ultimately has to play here.</p><p>NIELSEN: It's very weak one, right, because it -- the U.K. is small in this context. I think there's days from day one, it believes that you cannot have most of sort of the settlements and the bit --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- on the financial outside the E.U. So there will be some pushback on this one. And there is on this specific issue a degree of also there's a benefit for us if you will. I mean there is a -- you can see how Frankfurt and Paris and Dublin, all other countries and other cities that sort of stopping to sort of the competing to get the financial industries in there. So I -- look, if Brexit is anything but a very soft one, it's a negative for all of us, little (INAUDIBLE) into my mind about that but more so for the U.K., right?</p><p>JOHNSON: So, I agree. I just wanting about if I run a company (INAUDIBLE) right funding or sell a bond or whatever it is I need to do. One of the things this happen is the financial crisis is that the U.S. capital markets have become bigger. One of the things that happened is the financial crisis is that the European capital markets have become smaller.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: Now one of the things that happened after the financial crisis was that Europe said what we need to do is get deeper capital markets here.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: One of the critical factors for our economy if we're going to take it forward from here.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: The most obvious thing to do is to use one of the global financial centers within the time zone to generate that process. Yet we're about to see the cliff edge where for removes that for being a possibility.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. But in powered up you have the banking union and the capitalize (ph) union under construction, if you will.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. Slow construction.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes, exactly. But its -- I mean, the banking union has -- I mean from their point of view it's not been slow, but it's, you know, like a war right now. But the capitalize union is underway, right? And the credit will take some years for sure.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik Nielsen of Unicredit sitting alongside us here on the desk. Erik, so we're just having a little of a chat in the break, and we were talking about whether or not the fed is going to raise three or four and it kind of went, and I'm a bit worried about next year.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Should the fed be cutting rates at this point?</p><p>NIELSEN: No, probably not. I wouldn't cut rates, but I think if I were a betting man, I think I would bet on a rate cut towards the end of next year. I mean, so people are thinking, how far do they keep going, and nobody is talking about the cost because I think there's a measure of probability that next year sees a significant slowdown.</p><p>JOHNSON: Recession?</p><p>NIELSEN: You won't get probably a recession like two quarters of negative growth within 2019, I think. But when we come into early 2020, very likely probability (INAUDIBLE) say that's a very high probability and that means growth will slow almost a year before. So that sort of a year now certainly. And that's when the fed typically stop hiking and then at one states down the line towards the end of next year, I could easily see them cut.</p><p>JOHNSON: So the fed is going to be cutting as the ECB is exiting. It's going to be an interesting middle conundrum (INAUDIBLE), isn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes. I think its -- yes, exactly. And that's why you have to think Euro-dollar moves higher.</p><p>LACQUA: But Erik why would you just not hike as much instead of then -- you know, you use credibility. We've seen it here in Europe about 15 years ago. If you hike and then cut, the markets freak out.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. Well, you hike until you don't hike anymore, and then you wait for maybe six, nine months, and then you cut in the normal scenario, right? But I think the probability of -- I mean, and so this is my view of next year that at least that it's a high probability. But its -- if I were the fed, I would also hike now, but I would not say four hikes this year. I mean, I think what's in it for that?</p><p>LACQUA: The growth is good. What would happen in 18 months from now?</p><p>NIELSEN: So my -- there are two issues. Pure macro, half of the increase in private consumption in America has been funded for two years now by a drawdown in household savings, and they seems to its down 2.5%. So this is vulnerable. This is 70% of GDP in America, right?</p><p>Then you have the risks of policies, the trade stuff, and the fiscal expansion. And what does the fiscal expansion do for insurance and they'll buy to the 10-year? So, my view would be that there's certainly a risk that sudden this thing falls off quite measurable at sometime down the line.</p><p>LACQUA: What does it mean for -- so who would be hit, is it that? But this is regardless of tariffs and trade, or is it?</p><p>NIELSEN: So the underlying fundamentals would suggest to me that sometime next year you have a slowdown. Tariffs and trade raises the risk that it happens more abruptly and earlier.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you think the Euro goes up on this? I'm sorry, I'm trying to consider the other argument out, which is --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm shocked.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- as the fed is -- yes. Sorry. And as the fed has been hiking rates and the interest rate differential on the 10 years go wider and wider and wider, the dollar has gone down. So I'm just going to throw it out there. Does the dollar go up when the fed starts?</p><p>NIELSEN: No. No. No. Your --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON: But Euro dollar has gone up when the fed is hiking. They got this huge interest rate --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- differential, so --</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't think that's as powerful as the fiscal expansion. I mean, so --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- we had a -- we have a nice -- my colleague (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- has a great chart on the U.S. budget deficit adjusted for the cyclicals and need (INAUDIBLE) chart --</p><p>JOHNSON: The Euro has gone up because of the U.S. twin deficit?</p><p>NIELSEN: No, the dollar has gone down, right?</p><p>JOHNSON: OK.</p><p>NIELSEN: And that's probably the --</p><p>JOHNSON: No. No. But its --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. No. No. No. Because the dollar weakness more than as a Euro spends dollar. That's important too.</p><p>LACQUA: That's not how Draghi is feeling it.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. Yes, yes, exactly and rightly so. I mean look at the trade where the Euro has got up by roughly half of what your dollar has right. So its dollar is dramatic. But --</p><p>JOHNSON: The trade (INAUDIBLE) Euro is down because the (INAUDIBLE) hasn't moved or --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. It's been helping that's right, that's right. I mean, and I mean the other trading partner we have the sterling, right, and then we have the central Europeans and all the rest of it, so its, yes, but there then maybe it's a very big part of the story, right.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. This is trade where the Euro, I caught it up in time.</p><p>NIELSEN: With --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm so happy. There it is. It's there on the left.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>LACQUA: Between the --</p><p>NIELSEN: That's between the Euro Bank.</p><p>LACQUA: So that --</p><p>NIELSEN: So what's the problem, right?</p><p>LACQUA: What do we do from here?</p><p>NIELSEN: So that's put to my point is first for the ECB what's the problem, right?</p><p>JOHNSON: It's gone sideways. Those on the thin on radio it's gone sideways.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. So, I think from where does it go from here? I think it will -- we will edge higher. Over this year if I have to -- I mean if I were basically a betting man, I would say maybe 5% or thereabouts. Nothing too dramatic.</p><p>JOHNSON: Somebody is already complaining about it now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Explain this.</p><p>NIELSEN: I mean, yes, they are and yet their export numbers are still growing faster than global trade and global GDP. So they're still getting market shares around the world. But of course it's nicer too -- if you're an exporter to have a weaker currency.</p><p>JOHNSON: Who's at the other day one of the ECB --</p><p>NIELSEN: And I'll prefer they didn't have, right. I mean --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. one of the ECB guys the other day was talking about the fact this is as good as it gets for the ECB better much on inflation restore coming through. The growth momentum story's been there, it's</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BLGSSH-2018032090cb556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLGSSH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXP-FT31-DXH2-6210-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">363236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg, LP All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Bloomberg: Surveillance Show</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Richard Windsor</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Erik Nielsen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tariffs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Data</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Currency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Inflation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Also  with us for the hour, he is Erik Nielsen and he is Unicredit Group Chief  Economist.</p><p>So, Erik, thank you so much.  Stay there, because we'll get to you in a  second.</p><p>Richard, when it comes to the tech selloff -- </p><p>RICHARD WINDSOR, FOUNDER, RADIO FREE MOBILE:  Good morning.</p><p>LACQUA:  -- what exactly -- good morning to you -- what exactly freaked the  markets?  Is it that, you know, had a trajectory, where a lot of these  stocks were going when you were driverless cars could go now next and now  it's all hanging up in the air?</p><p>WINDSOR:  No, I think you got a number of factors.  I mean you've had the  really large -- the really tech companies that have had, you know, one of  the greatest runs they've ever had.  You've got the prospect of increasing  interest rates.</p><p>And then also, if you look at the stocks that are dependent on monetization  of user data like Google and Facebook and Twitter, these are the ones that  have most impacted.  So I suspect it's more about these factors, combined  with increasing fear of regulation in terms of what people can and cannot  do with data that has been given to them by users that are causing the  problems.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes, we also heard that the E.U. was probably considering a  digital tax as a trade to this few (ph) kind of rages on.  What would that  look like?</p><p>WINDSOR:  Great question.  Very difficult to tell, I mean, I guess what  they would look to do would be to impose a tax on revenues that have been  derived in the region.  That would be the simplest way of doing it as I  presume.</p><p>But overall, I mean, my personal opinion is hold data issue is it will  eventually blow over.  And the reason why it will blow over is because  there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my opinion in terms of how the  internet works and users seem to have the opinion that the internet is  free, isn't and never has been.  What you're actually doing is just paying  for service with personal data.</p><p>Once users get more accustomed to that, then I think that there will be an  easier situation where you can choose.  You pay the cash or you pay with  personal data, and that's how I think it's going to evolve going forward.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Do you value these companies though at the  same level if that is the case?  Because, as you say, at the moment, there  is this misapprehension that the service is free.  But basically these are  data monetization companies.</p><p>WINDSOR:  Exactly.  And actually, I think it is.  As a matter of fact, the  research that Radio Free Mobile has done over the last five years actually  (INAUDIBLE) this out, which is that, you know, you have a choice.  Let's  just take for example, Google.  Google has a choice.  You could basically  come to Google and say yes, you can use my personal data and I will use --  get your services for free or I don't want you to use my personal data,  I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $5 a month for the service.</p><p>Now, obviously, these companies would set the pricing of that service at  the level at which there should be no real impact on revenue overall.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Do you think there's a breakup risk here, Richard?</p><p>WINDSOR:  In terms of?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Are these companies too big, too powerful, somebody pointed out  to me earlier on, they spend a huge amount of money in terms of lobbying in  Washington.  They control huge sways (ph) of the technology sector across  the United States and across the world.  We've seen it in history, when  companies and sectors become too big, there is a regulatory impetus that  starts but ultimately ends up leading to breakup.</p><p>WINDSOR:  I think it's this possibility, but it's a very distinct  possibility.  If you look at Google, your first question want to ask is,  well, what am I going to break it up into?  Because, you know, and there is  a reasonable argument in this level of Google that it is a one-trick pony,  but it does search and everything else is fairly minor.</p><p>As a result of that, you would have great difficulty breaking that up into  its constituent parts.  In the same, you could level exactly the same  accusation at Facebook.  Facebook generates almost all of its revenue off  its social network, so the question is, what would you break it up into?</p><p>LACQUA:  Let's also bring Erik Nielsen of Unicredit into the conversation.   Erik, I know you don't look at this thing day out, but you must have a view  on driverless cars and automation and even the end of cash, and the impact  it has on the economy in 5, 10, 15 years.  Does anything that happens in  the last, you know, the last couple of days change that deal?</p><p>ERIK NIELSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT GROUP:  I'm getting more and more  nervous.  I think we had maybe an overshot in terms of globalization after  the crisis and through the crisis sort of extent and I see a lot of winding  back of this.  And I think what you're referring to and what we just talked  about on the -- in the I.T. industry and the tech industries.  I share sort  of guy sort of skepticism here.</p><p>I mean, to some extent, these companies have been broken up in the sense  that they're not free to operate in China and Russia, for example, right?   There are positive words that we don't want this, right, and all the  Europeans are saying a little bit, I don't really think you pay enough  taxes because you shoveling through islands, so maybe, so we should say  exactly as Richard said, maybe we should tax the pays with the revenues  come in.</p><p>But this whole thing is not a smooth process, right?  So you have to worry  a little about this sort of how that impacts the economy in a negative way.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But we find ourselves in a situation where the Chinese, as long  as you got -- they two sort of two buckets of tech stocks around the world  at the moment, you got the kind of the U.S. bucket and you got the Asian  bucket, which is largely the Chinese buckets.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Europe doesn't have much.</p><p>NIELSEN:  No.</p><p>JOHNSON:  So it kind of falls into one of those two.  The Chinese bucket is  going to be made up of companies that are going to get bigger and,  therefore, potentially stronger, whereas there is increasingly this  regulatory taxation burden that is likely to be put on the U.S. once.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>JOHNSON:  So are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage -- are we heading  down the road of a kind of trade war their tech versus our tech?  Are we  putting ourselves at a disadvantage?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I don't know if we -- yes, from a very sort of liberal kind of  world view we are, in a sense, but I think what we have seen is some of the  backlash to what's this in the (INAUDIBLE) of things and (INAUDIBLE) now  where these companies seems to be if the reporting is correct, meddling  with the political process.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So then I think most people will think, well, then there has to  be some measures to take this back, right?  So I -- and that's what I meant  by what I said before.  I don't think that taking it, but I think  politically, it's understandable and probably desirable, but it's not  smooth for the economy as this happens.</p><p>LACQUA:  And, Richard, what are you watching out for in the next 74 hours?   Will it be testimonies to kind of exactly understand where a lot of these  big companies go from here?</p><p>WINDSOR:  My personal suspicion is that things are -- that, you know, you  had a bit of fuzz.  People start to get worried about the use of data.   Obviously, actually and if you look at the data leak, there is piece of  happen where at 50, I think it was 50 million accountable data and 50  million of Facebook accounts made it into a private data analysis firm.</p><p>If you actually look at Facebook has actually changed its policy so you can  no longer do that.  So what I suspect will actually happen is there's going  to be talk, a bit of softness, but I, you know, I think at the end of the  day, we're coming into earnings season.  Quite possibly, we're going to  have another reason a good season from the big tech companies.</p><p>So as a result of that, I suspect a small correction, but then, you know,  continuation of business as normal, at least for another quarter or so.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Richard, thank you so much.  Richard Windsor there,  founder of Radio Free Mobile and Erik Nielsen of Unicredit stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Erik Nielsen still with us from Unicredit.  Erik, where's the  tipping point in this story?  The Chinese and we've -- we saw this sort of  18 months ago with the Davos speech that was delivered by the Chinese  premier, have tried to play sort of the calm, rational actor in this story,  but you just kind of wonder where they are being pushed to and at what  point they start to retaliate, because that's when the game really starts.   Where do you think that point is?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I don't know, but I think there are a couple of things going on,  right?  The one part is that it's I think it's an irony that China is now  the defender of free trade, right?  At the end of the day, they have a lot  of subsidized industries -- </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  -- and all the rest of it, and so the real tragedy for me here is  that these are the protector of the (INAUDIBLE) lateral world have decided  that they don't want to be, as the U.S., they don't want to really be the  free trade champion anymore.</p><p>So, now, we are in this back room and ironically somebody getting sort of - - </p><p>JOHNSON:  They fills it.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Job filling in, exactly, in a peculiar way.  But where do this --  where do they draw the lines?  It's impossible to say, because it's a big  political decision for them at the end of the day.  They have to do  something, but I suspect they will retaliate very modestly, because they  don't want I say the exactly -- </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  -- they don't want the trade war.</p><p>JOHNSON:  In some ways, this feels very much like how we used to think  about the cold war, escalation theory, deterrence.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That kind of the language.  Is that the direction we're going in,  and is that a useful sort of way of thinking about this?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, I think July (ph) -- I mean, let me start by saying, I  think you could -- we haven't named it yet, but I think we already are in  Cold War II, but more with Russia, right it's in a sense.  And politically,  this is completely cold war stuff we're going through now, and it can -- I  don't see the breaking point there to where we stop this sort of escalation  on the political side between.  But this time around, compared to the  original cold war, we have now China being a major player and the leading  western (ph) power not being a leading player.  So this is confusing,  right.</p><p>LACQUA:  But Erik, you have American businessmen who basically yesterday  said, look, $60 billion it will also hurt the U.S. economy.  How can you  quantify that?  Do we know by how much?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Not at the top of my head.  It's very, very little, I mean, if  you're -- I mean, look, if you're doing the trade tariffs and you do sort  of the steel and aluminum and you do a $60 billion on top of that, it is a  decimal point on GDP at most, right.  But the question is, if the Chinese  retaliate and it comes back and forth a couple of times, well, then  suddenly it could be.</p><p>There was a study by Obstfeld the IMF Chief Economist some years ago that  estimates it that if you planted 20% tax -- import tax in America I think  it was, on all Chinese imports, you could have something like half a  percent cut to U.S. GDP by the exchange rate.</p><p>LACQUA:  How would China retaliate?  So even if they don't, you know, throw  the fire on the other side, can they retaliate in measures that we don't  really notice, but put investment in Europe?  Is there actually -- can  Europe benefit from this?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, I mean, it's all I was going to say, if the (INAUDIBLE) of  course, how can they retaliate?  I hope they retaliate just like they try  to smooth Trump by maybe revoking some of the licenses for his daughters  back in China or something, very symbolic, very sort of tell him you don't  like what we do.</p><p>But the most serious question you ask, yes, I'm sure Europe can benefit  instead and I think already, as I understand the conversations between  particular Berlin and Beijing are in full flow on this.  How can we at  least prevent that we get down on the slippery slope to watch each other?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Does the Trump camp see that as being Europe ending up in China's  camp?  Europe is trying to figure out how it gets around the aluminum and  steel tariffs.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  If the White House perceives that the negotiations are in full  flow and the Chinese and the Europeans are negotiating.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Does that isolate Washington even further?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, it does.  I mean, it's the -- I forget who coined it, I  mean, from America first (INAUDIBLE) alone, right.  I mean, that idea then  it's the problem is I don't know, but I -- my suspect that Trump and Ross  (ph) and these people are don't really see things the same way we see them.   They say, well, people are just being confused.  The \"F.T.\" is up yesterday  is saying that it's very -- calling some Europeans, it's very difficult,  because he's so unpredictable Trump.  I suspect if Trump reads the \"F.T.\"  which should probably doesn't, he would say, that's good, that's what I'm  messing around with them, right?  And -- but this is strange.  It's not  good for the economy</p><p>LACQUA:  I mean, it could be seen as a win for the (INAUDIBLE).  I know  whether he reads the \"F.T.\", but I know he's watching, so I'm sure he's  listening right now.</p><p>We'll get back to Erik shortly.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Well, still with us is Erik Nielsen of Unicredit.  Erik, how does  this translate into your world?  Do you have the currency angle?  Of you  course you haven't said your angle, angle.  Do you worry a little bit less  about Saudi Arabia in terms of finances than you maybe did six, eight  months ago because of the old price?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, for sure.  Right.  I mean there's -- I worry over less about  them for two reasons.  The oil price as you said and the fact that it feels  like they're to reform and becoming closer to the west and reform the  economy, which haven't been done.  Whether they would be successful, I  would -- I don't know, right.  One has to be skipped but certainly a high  oil price and this sort of stabilization is good.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  What does that mean?  I mean the oil price, what is the  metric when you look at the oil price inflation?  Does it feed through  inflation in the U.S.?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes, it does and that's best, right.  I mean that's best and  very clear.  By you can say we've been asking for more inflation in America  and Europe for a long time.  We don't want inflation as cost push right.  I  mean, because oil prices go up.</p><p>That's bad inflation.  Its -- we want inflation because the output closes  and therefore demand push inflation higher, right.  That's the -- that's  what we really want.  But what I meant by good news is that also in it for  the west, you need a stable Middle East.  And forever stay in Middle East  you need oil prices and solar (ph) maybe this (INAUDIBLE) at least north of  50 probably.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Talking inflation, we just had U.K. CPI drop and maybe the wrong  kind of inflation, because it's been driven by what's been happening with  the pound.  The data just came out a few minutes ago.  The pound popping  around a little bit on it.</p><p>I'm just going to my (INAUDIBLE) screen.  The number going through at 2.7.   Previously it was 3.0.  It was surveyed to come through at 2.8.  It's now  come down to 2.7.</p><p>We do have a bank of England decision coming up in a few days' time.  It's  going to be interesting to see ultimately whether or not actually the  markets price in the bank right in terms of the, A, the inflation  expectations, and B, whether or not that isn't likely to lead to an ongoing  rate hiking cycle.  We'll see.  We'll find out later on this week.  Marconi  is going to tell us.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.  And Erik would you bring over to my chart.  Now this is  basically, we're looking at DWI (ph) repeat function, we're also looking at  traders and how much they feel the BOE can act.  Do you feel like they can?   So this is basically showing at least one of BOE rate hikes this year.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  Can they afford to even hike once?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I wouldn't if I were them.  I think -- but I think they will.  I  mean I think is the -- yes, I think the U.K. economy is too weak, and they  should look through the inflation at this stage.  That would be my view.  I  think its -- but I think they have set themselves in motion that they have  -- they've had the inflation numbers obviously and they've set themselves  in most of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  No.  No.  No.  The U.K. economy is running at -- it was running  at 17 miles an hour without shaking, right?  The kind of the outputs and it  now running at 60 miles an hour without shaking.  But if we run the economy  60 miles an hour, it starts to shake.  We don't have the same potential  growth rate we used to have.  So the inflation story is a bigger risk  therefore the banks should act earlier, shouldn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN:  If you're running at 60 miles an hour without shaking, maybe so.   I'm looking more at maybe 30 and a lot of shaking.</p><p>JOHNSON:  OK.  (INAUDIBLE) and you're making the point.</p><p>NIELSEN:  But it's -- so I would -- yes, I don't see why you hurry.  I mean  the risk that it faces our control here is not very high.  So I -- Look  lets also (INAUDIBLE) whether the hike ones or not in a year makes no  difference to the economy.  That's just -- I mean the market gets very  excited this thing.</p><p>JOHNSON:  You know --</p><p>NIELSEN:  In real life, 25 basis points at one is not important.</p><p>LACQUA:  You're breaking our heart, Erik.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Oh sorry.</p><p>LACQUA:  Erik Nielsen with Unicredit staying with us.  We'll talk a little  bit more about what the market cares and doesn't care about.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Erik, what are we -- what is (INAUDIBLE) the impact of a cliff  edge on the European E.U. economy after the U.K. leaves if we don't have  the same ago aggregation of financial services in London, the access to  those bit markets, those capital markets, ceases to be there for European  companies.  What is the downsize for Europe?  I'm just trying to understand  how strong a card the U.K. where place it ultimately has to play here.</p><p>NIELSEN:  It's very weak one, right, because it -- the U.K. is small in  this context.  I think there's days from day one, it believes that you  cannot have most of sort of the settlements and the bit --</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  -- on the financial outside the E.U.  So there will be some  pushback on this one.  And there is on this specific issue a degree of also  there's a benefit for us if you will.  I mean there is a -- you can see how  Frankfurt and Paris and Dublin, all other countries and other cities that  sort of stopping to sort of the competing to get the financial industries  in there.  So I -- look, if Brexit is anything but a very soft one, it's a  negative for all of us, little (INAUDIBLE) into my mind about that but more  so for the U.K., right?</p><p>JOHNSON:  So, I agree.  I just wanting about if I run a company (INAUDIBLE)  right funding or sell a bond or whatever it is I need to do.  One of the  things this happen is the financial crisis is that the U.S. capital markets  have become bigger.  One of the things that happened is the financial  crisis is that the European capital markets have become smaller.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Now one of the things that happened after the financial crisis  was that Europe said what we need to do is get deeper capital markets here.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>JOHNSON:  One of the critical factors for our economy if we're going to  take it forward from here.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  The most obvious thing to do is to use one of the global  financial centers within the time zone to generate that process.  Yet we're  about to see the cliff edge where for removes that for being a possibility.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  But in powered up you have the banking union and the  capitalize (ph) union under construction, if you will.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  Slow construction.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes, exactly.  But its -- I mean, the banking union has -- I  mean from their point of view it's not been slow, but it's, you know, like  a war right now.  But the capitalize union is underway, right?  And the  credit will take some years for sure.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Erik Nielsen of Unicredit sitting alongside us here on the desk.   Erik, so we're just having a little of a chat in the break, and we were  talking about whether or not the fed is going to raise three or four and it  kind of went, and I'm a bit worried about next year.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Should the fed be cutting rates at this point?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No, probably not.  I wouldn't cut rates, but I think if I were a  betting man, I think I would bet on a rate cut towards the end of next  year.  I mean, so people are thinking, how far do they keep going, and  nobody is talking about the cost because I think there's a measure of  probability that next year sees a significant slowdown.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Recession?</p><p>NIELSEN:  You won't get probably a recession like two quarters of negative  growth within 2019, I think.  But when we come into early 2020, very likely  probability (INAUDIBLE) say that's a very high probability and that means  growth will slow almost a year before.  So that sort of a year now  certainly.  And that's when the fed typically stop hiking and then at one  states down the line towards the end of next year, I could easily see them  cut.</p><p>JOHNSON:  So the fed is going to be cutting as the ECB is exiting.  It's  going to be an interesting middle conundrum (INAUDIBLE), isn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.  I think its -- yes, exactly.  And that's why you have  to think Euro-dollar moves higher.</p><p>LACQUA:  But Erik why would you just not hike as much instead of then --  you know, you use credibility.  We've seen it here in Europe about 15 years  ago.  If you hike and then cut, the markets freak out.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  Well, you hike until you don't hike anymore, and then you  wait for maybe six, nine months, and then you cut in the normal scenario,  right?  But I think the probability of -- I mean, and so this is my view of  next year that at least that it's a high probability.  But its -- if I were  the fed, I would also hike now, but I would not say four hikes this year.   I mean, I think what's in it for that?</p><p>LACQUA:  The growth is good.  What would happen in 18 months from now?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So my -- there are two issues.  Pure macro, half of the increase  in private consumption in America has been funded for two years now by a  drawdown in household savings, and they seems to its down 2.5%.  So this is  vulnerable.  This is 70% of GDP in America, right?</p><p>Then you have the risks of policies, the trade stuff, and the fiscal  expansion.  And what does the fiscal expansion do for insurance and they'll  buy to the 10-year?  So, my view would be that there's certainly a risk  that sudden this thing falls off quite measurable at sometime down the  line.</p><p>LACQUA:  What does it mean for -- so who would be hit, is it that?  But  this is regardless of tariffs and trade, or is it?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So the underlying fundamentals would suggest to me that sometime  next year you have a slowdown.  Tariffs and trade raises the risk that it  happens more abruptly and earlier.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Do you think the Euro goes up on this?  I'm sorry, I'm trying to  consider the other argument out, which is --</p><p>LACQUA:  I'm shocked.</p><p>JOHNSON:  -- as the fed is -- yes.  Sorry.  And as the fed has been hiking  rates and the interest rate differential on the 10 years go wider and wider  and wider, the dollar has gone down.  So I'm just going to throw it out  there.  Does the dollar go up when the fed starts?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No.  No.  No.  Your --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  But Euro dollar has gone up when the fed is hiking.  They got  this huge interest rate --</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON:  -- differential, so --</p><p>NIELSEN:  I don't think that's as powerful as the fiscal expansion.  I  mean, so --</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  -- we had a -- we have a nice -- my colleague (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  -- has a great chart on the U.S. budget deficit adjusted for the  cyclicals and need (INAUDIBLE) chart --</p><p>JOHNSON:  The Euro has gone up because of the U.S. twin deficit?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No, the dollar has gone down, right?</p><p>JOHNSON:  OK.</p><p>NIELSEN:  And that's probably the --</p><p>JOHNSON:  No.  No.  But its --</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  No.  No.  No.  Because the dollar weakness more than as a  Euro spends dollar.  That's important too.</p><p>LACQUA:  That's not how Draghi is feeling it.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  Yes, yes, exactly and rightly so.  I mean look at the trade  where the Euro has got up by roughly half of what your dollar has right.   So its dollar is dramatic.  But -- </p><p>JOHNSON:  The trade (INAUDIBLE) Euro is down because the (INAUDIBLE) hasn't  moved or --</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  It's been helping that's right, that's right.  I mean, and  I mean the other trading partner we have the sterling, right, and then we  have the central Europeans and all the rest of it, so its, yes, but there  then maybe it's a very big part of the story, right.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  This is trade where the Euro, I caught it up in time.</p><p>NIELSEN:  With --</p><p>LACQUA:  I'm so happy.  There it is.  It's there on the left.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>LACQUA:  Between the --</p><p>NIELSEN:  That's between the Euro Bank.</p><p>LACQUA:  So that --</p><p>NIELSEN:  So what's the problem, right?</p><p>LACQUA:  What do we do from here?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So that's put to my point is first for the ECB what's the  problem, right?</p><p>JOHNSON:  It's gone sideways.  Those on the thin on radio it's gone  sideways.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  So, I think from where does it go from here?  I think it  will -- we will edge higher.  Over this year if I have to -- I mean if I  were basically a betting man, I would say maybe 5% or thereabouts.  Nothing  too dramatic.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Somebody is already complaining about it now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  Explain this.</p><p>NIELSEN:  I mean, yes, they are and yet their export numbers are still  growing faster than global trade and global GDP.  So they're still getting  market shares around the world.  But of course it's nicer too -- if you're  an exporter to have a weaker currency.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Who's at the other day one of the ECB --</p><p>NIELSEN:  And I'll prefer they didn't have, right.  I mean --</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  one of the ECB guys the other day was talking about the  fact this is as good as it gets for the ECB better much on inflation  restore coming through.  The growth momentum story's been there, it's</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ANALST-2016517506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ANALST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-G9P1-JBHT-D2J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317413</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Analyst Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Also with us for the hour, he is Erik Nielsen and he is Unicredit Group Chief Economist.</p><p>So, Erik, thank you so much. Stay there, because we'll get to you in a second.</p><p>Richard, when it comes to the tech selloff --</p><p>RICHARD WINDSOR, FOUNDER, RADIO FREE MOBILE: Good morning.</p><p>LACQUA: -- what exactly -- good morning to you -- what exactly freaked the markets? Is it that, you know, had a trajectory, where a lot of these stocks were going when you were driverless cars could go now next and now it's all hanging up in the air?</p><p>WINDSOR: No, I think you got a number of factors. I mean you've had the really large -- the really tech companies that have had, you know, one of the greatest runs they've ever had. You've got the prospect of increasing interest rates.</p><p>And then also, if you look at the stocks that are dependent on monetization of user data like Google and Facebook and Twitter, these are the ones that have most impacted. So I suspect it's more about these factors, combined with increasing fear of regulation in terms of what people can and cannot do with data that has been given to them by users that are causing the problems.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes, we also heard that the E.U. was probably considering a digital tax as a trade to this few (ph) kind of rages on. What would that look like?</p><p>WINDSOR: Great question. Very difficult to tell, I mean, I guess what they would look to do would be to impose a tax on revenues that have been derived in the region. That would be the simplest way of doing it as I presume.</p><p>But overall, I mean, my personal opinion is hold data issue is it will eventually blow over. And the reason why it will blow over is because there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my opinion in terms of how the internet works and users seem to have the opinion that the internet is free, isn't and never has been. What you're actually doing is just paying for service with personal data.</p><p>Once users get more accustomed to that, then I think that there will be an easier situation where you can choose. You pay the cash or you pay with personal data, and that's how I think it's going to evolve going forward.</p><p>GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Do you value these companies though at the same level if that is the case? Because, as you say, at the moment, there is this misapprehension that the service is free. But basically these are data monetization companies.</p><p>WINDSOR: Exactly. And actually, I think it is. As a matter of fact, the research that Radio Free Mobile has done over the last five years actually (INAUDIBLE) this out, which is that, you know, you have a choice. Let's just take for example, Google. Google has a choice. You could basically come to Google and say yes, you can use my personal data and I will use -- get your services for free or I don't want you to use my personal data, I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $5 a month for the service.</p><p>Now, obviously, these companies would set the pricing of that service at the level at which there should be no real impact on revenue overall.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you think there's a breakup risk here, Richard?</p><p>WINDSOR: In terms of?</p><p>JOHNSON: Are these companies too big, too powerful, somebody pointed out to me earlier on, they spend a huge amount of money in terms of lobbying in Washington. They control huge sways (ph) of the technology sector across the United States and across the world. We've seen it in history, when companies and sectors become too big, there is a regulatory impetus that starts but ultimately ends up leading to breakup.</p><p>WINDSOR: I think it's this possibility, but it's a very distinct possibility. If you look at Google, your first question want to ask is, well, what am I going to break it up into? Because, you know, and there is a reasonable argument in this level of Google that it is a one-trick pony, but it does search and everything else is fairly minor.</p><p>As a result of that, you would have great difficulty breaking that up into its constituent parts. In the same, you could level exactly the same accusation at Facebook. Facebook generates almost all of its revenue off its social network, so the question is, what would you break it up into?</p><p>LACQUA: Let's also bring Erik Nielsen of Unicredit into the conversation. Erik, I know you don't look at this thing day out, but you must have a view on driverless cars and automation and even the end of cash, and the impact it has on the economy in 5, 10, 15 years. Does anything that happens in the last, you know, the last couple of days change that deal?</p><p>ERIK NIELSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT GROUP: I'm getting more and more nervous. I think we had maybe an overshot in terms of globalization after the crisis and through the crisis sort of extent and I see a lot of winding back of this. And I think what you're referring to and what we just talked about on the -- in the I.T. industry and the tech industries. I share sort of guy sort of skepticism here.</p><p>I mean, to some extent, these companies have been broken up in the sense that they're not free to operate in China and Russia, for example, right? There are positive words that we don't want this, right, and all the Europeans are saying a little bit, I don't really think you pay enough taxes because you shoveling through islands, so maybe, so we should say exactly as Richard said, maybe we should tax the pays with the revenues come in.</p><p>But this whole thing is not a smooth process, right? So you have to worry a little about this sort of how that impacts the economy in a negative way.</p><p>JOHNSON: But we find ourselves in a situation where the Chinese, as long as you got -- they two sort of two buckets of tech stocks around the world at the moment, you got the kind of the U.S. bucket and you got the Asian bucket, which is largely the Chinese buckets.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Europe doesn't have much.</p><p>NIELSEN: No.</p><p>JOHNSON: So it kind of falls into one of those two. The Chinese bucket is going to be made up of companies that are going to get bigger and, therefore, potentially stronger, whereas there is increasingly this regulatory taxation burden that is likely to be put on the U.S. once.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: So are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage -- are we heading down the road of a kind of trade war their tech versus our tech? Are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage?</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't know if we -- yes, from a very sort of liberal kind of world view we are, in a sense, but I think what we have seen is some of the backlash to what's this in the (INAUDIBLE) of things and (INAUDIBLE) now where these companies seems to be if the reporting is correct, meddling with the political process.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: So then I think most people will think, well, then there has to be some measures to take this back, right? So I -- and that's what I meant by what I said before. I don't think that taking it, but I think politically, it's understandable and probably desirable, but it's not smooth for the economy as this happens.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Richard, what are you watching out for in the next 74 hours? Will it be testimonies to kind of exactly understand where a lot of these big companies go from here?</p><p>WINDSOR: My personal suspicion is that things are -- that, you know, you had a bit of fuzz. People start to get worried about the use of data. Obviously, actually and if you look at the data leak, there is piece of happen where at 50, I think it was 50 million accountable data and 50 million of Facebook accounts made it into a private data analysis firm.</p><p>If you actually look at Facebook has actually changed its policy so you can no longer do that. So what I suspect will actually happen is there's going to be talk, a bit of softness, but I, you know, I think at the end of the day, we're coming into earnings season. Quite possibly, we're going to have another reason a good season from the big tech companies.</p><p>So as a result of that, I suspect a small correction, but then, you know, continuation of business as normal, at least for another quarter or so.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Richard, thank you so much. Richard Windsor there, founder of Radio Free Mobile and Erik Nielsen of Unicredit stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik Nielsen still with us from Unicredit. Erik, where's the tipping point in this story? The Chinese and we've -- we saw this sort of 18 months ago with the Davos speech that was delivered by the Chinese premier, have tried to play sort of the calm, rational actor in this story, but you just kind of wonder where they are being pushed to and at what point they start to retaliate, because that's when the game really starts. Where do you think that point is?</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't know, but I think there are a couple of things going on, right? The one part is that it's I think it's an irony that China is now the defender of free trade, right? At the end of the day, they have a lot of subsidized industries --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- and all the rest of it, and so the real tragedy for me here is that these are the protector of the (INAUDIBLE) lateral world have decided that they don't want to be, as the U.S., they don't want to really be the free trade champion anymore.</p><p>So, now, we are in this back room and ironically somebody getting sort of - -</p><p>JOHNSON: They fills it.</p><p>NIELSEN: Job filling in, exactly, in a peculiar way. But where do this -- where do they draw the lines? It's impossible to say, because it's a big political decision for them at the end of the day. They have to do something, but I suspect they will retaliate very modestly, because they don't want I say the exactly --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- they don't want the trade war.</p><p>JOHNSON: In some ways, this feels very much like how we used to think about the cold war, escalation theory, deterrence.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: That kind of the language. Is that the direction we're going in, and is that a useful sort of way of thinking about this?</p><p>NIELSEN: Well, I think July (ph) -- I mean, let me start by saying, I think you could -- we haven't named it yet, but I think we already are in Cold War II, but more with Russia, right it's in a sense. And politically, this is completely cold war stuff we're going through now, and it can -- I don't see the breaking point there to where we stop this sort of escalation on the political side between. But this time around, compared to the original cold war, we have now China being a major player and the leading western (ph) power not being a leading player. So this is confusing, right.</p><p>LACQUA: But Erik, you have American businessmen who basically yesterday said, look, $60 billion it will also hurt the U.S. economy. How can you quantify that? Do we know by how much?</p><p>NIELSEN: Not at the top of my head. It's very, very little, I mean, if you're -- I mean, look, if you're doing the trade tariffs and you do sort of the steel and aluminum and you do a $60 billion on top of that, it is a decimal point on GDP at most, right. But the question is, if the Chinese retaliate and it comes back and forth a couple of times, well, then suddenly it could be.</p><p>There was a study by Obstfeld the IMF Chief Economist some years ago that estimates it that if you planted 20% tax -- import tax in America I think it was, on all Chinese imports, you could have something like half a percent cut to U.S. GDP by the exchange rate.</p><p>LACQUA: How would China retaliate? So even if they don't, you know, throw the fire on the other side, can they retaliate in measures that we don't really notice, but put investment in Europe? Is there actually -- can Europe benefit from this?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, I mean, it's all I was going to say, if the (INAUDIBLE) of course, how can they retaliate? I hope they retaliate just like they try to smooth Trump by maybe revoking some of the licenses for his daughters back in China or something, very symbolic, very sort of tell him you don't like what we do.</p><p>But the most serious question you ask, yes, I'm sure Europe can benefit instead and I think already, as I understand the conversations between particular Berlin and Beijing are in full flow on this. How can we at least prevent that we get down on the slippery slope to watch each other?</p><p>JOHNSON: Does the Trump camp see that as being Europe ending up in China's camp? Europe is trying to figure out how it gets around the aluminum and steel tariffs.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: If the White House perceives that the negotiations are in full flow and the Chinese and the Europeans are negotiating.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Does that isolate Washington even further?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, it does. I mean, it's the -- I forget who coined it, I mean, from America first (INAUDIBLE) alone, right. I mean, that idea then it's the problem is I don't know, but I -- my suspect that Trump and Ross (ph) and these people are don't really see things the same way we see them. They say, well, people are just being confused. The \"F.T.\" is up yesterday is saying that it's very -- calling some Europeans, it's very difficult, because he's so unpredictable Trump. I suspect if Trump reads the \"F.T.\" which should probably doesn't, he would say, that's good, that's what I'm messing around with them, right? And -- but this is strange. It's not good for the economy</p><p>LACQUA: I mean, it could be seen as a win for the (INAUDIBLE). I know whether he reads the \"F.T.\", but I know he's watching, so I'm sure he's listening right now.</p><p>We'll get back to Erik shortly.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us is Erik Nielsen of Unicredit. Erik, how does this translate into your world? Do you have the currency angle? Of you course you haven't said your angle, angle. Do you worry a little bit less about Saudi Arabia in terms of finances than you maybe did six, eight months ago because of the old price?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, for sure. Right. I mean there's -- I worry over less about them for two reasons. The oil price as you said and the fact that it feels like they're to reform and becoming closer to the west and reform the economy, which haven't been done. Whether they would be successful, I would -- I don't know, right. One has to be skipped but certainly a high oil price and this sort of stabilization is good.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. What does that mean? I mean the oil price, what is the metric when you look at the oil price inflation? Does it feed through inflation in the U.S.?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes, it does and that's best, right. I mean that's best and very clear. By you can say we've been asking for more inflation in America and Europe for a long time. We don't want inflation as cost push right. I mean, because oil prices go up.</p><p>That's bad inflation. Its -- we want inflation because the output closes and therefore demand push inflation higher, right. That's the -- that's what we really want. But what I meant by good news is that also in it for the west, you need a stable Middle East. And forever stay in Middle East you need oil prices and solar (ph) maybe this (INAUDIBLE) at least north of 50 probably.</p><p>JOHNSON: Talking inflation, we just had U.K. CPI drop and maybe the wrong kind of inflation, because it's been driven by what's been happening with the pound. The data just came out a few minutes ago. The pound popping around a little bit on it.</p><p>I'm just going to my (INAUDIBLE) screen. The number going through at 2.7. Previously it was 3.0. It was surveyed to come through at 2.8. It's now come down to 2.7.</p><p>We do have a bank of England decision coming up in a few days' time. It's going to be interesting to see ultimately whether or not actually the markets price in the bank right in terms of the, A, the inflation expectations, and B, whether or not that isn't likely to lead to an ongoing rate hiking cycle. We'll see. We'll find out later on this week. Marconi is going to tell us.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. And Erik would you bring over to my chart. Now this is basically, we're looking at DWI (ph) repeat function, we're also looking at traders and how much they feel the BOE can act. Do you feel like they can? So this is basically showing at least one of BOE rate hikes this year.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Can they afford to even hike once?</p><p>NIELSEN: I wouldn't if I were them. I think -- but I think they will. I mean I think is the -- yes, I think the U.K. economy is too weak, and they should look through the inflation at this stage. That would be my view. I think its -- but I think they have set themselves in motion that they have -- they've had the inflation numbers obviously and they've set themselves in most of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON: No. No. No. The U.K. economy is running at -- it was running at 17 miles an hour without shaking, right? The kind of the outputs and it now running at 60 miles an hour without shaking. But if we run the economy 60 miles an hour, it starts to shake. We don't have the same potential growth rate we used to have. So the inflation story is a bigger risk therefore the banks should act earlier, shouldn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN: If you're running at 60 miles an hour without shaking, maybe so. I'm looking more at maybe 30 and a lot of shaking.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK. (INAUDIBLE) and you're making the point.</p><p>NIELSEN: But it's -- so I would -- yes, I don't see why you hurry. I mean the risk that it faces our control here is not very high. So I -- Look lets also (INAUDIBLE) whether the hike ones or not in a year makes no difference to the economy. That's just -- I mean the market gets very excited this thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: You know --</p><p>NIELSEN: In real life, 25 basis points at one is not important.</p><p>LACQUA: You're breaking our heart, Erik.</p><p>NIELSEN: Oh sorry.</p><p>LACQUA: Erik Nielsen with Unicredit staying with us. We'll talk a little bit more about what the market cares and doesn't care about.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik, what are we -- what is (INAUDIBLE) the impact of a cliff edge on the European E.U. economy after the U.K. leaves if we don't have the same ago aggregation of financial services in London, the access to those bit markets, those capital markets, ceases to be there for European companies. What is the downsize for Europe? I'm just trying to understand how strong a card the U.K. where place it ultimately has to play here.</p><p>NIELSEN: It's very weak one, right, because it -- the U.K. is small in this context. I think there's days from day one, it believes that you cannot have most of sort of the settlements and the bit --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- on the financial outside the E.U. So there will be some pushback on this one. And there is on this specific issue a degree of also there's a benefit for us if you will. I mean there is a -- you can see how Frankfurt and Paris and Dublin, all other countries and other cities that sort of stopping to sort of the competing to get the financial industries in there. So I -- look, if Brexit is anything but a very soft one, it's a negative for all of us, little (INAUDIBLE) into my mind about that but more so for the U.K., right?</p><p>JOHNSON: So, I agree. I just wanting about if I run a company (INAUDIBLE) right funding or sell a bond or whatever it is I need to do. One of the things this happen is the financial crisis is that the U.S. capital markets have become bigger. One of the things that happened is the financial crisis is that the European capital markets have become smaller.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: Now one of the things that happened after the financial crisis was that Europe said what we need to do is get deeper capital markets here.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: One of the critical factors for our economy if we're going to take it forward from here.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: The most obvious thing to do is to use one of the global financial centers within the time zone to generate that process. Yet we're about to see the cliff edge where for removes that for being a possibility.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. But in powered up you have the banking union and the capitalize (ph) union under construction, if you will.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. Slow construction.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes, exactly. But its -- I mean, the banking union has -- I mean from their point of view it's not been slow, but it's, you know, like a war right now. But the capitalize union is underway, right? And the credit will take some years for sure.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Erik Nielsen of Unicredit sitting alongside us here on the desk. Erik, so we're just having a little of a chat in the break, and we were talking about whether or not the fed is going to raise three or four and it kind of went, and I'm a bit worried about next year.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Should the fed be cutting rates at this point?</p><p>NIELSEN: No, probably not. I wouldn't cut rates, but I think if I were a betting man, I think I would bet on a rate cut towards the end of next year. I mean, so people are thinking, how far do they keep going, and nobody is talking about the cost because I think there's a measure of probability that next year sees a significant slowdown.</p><p>JOHNSON: Recession?</p><p>NIELSEN: You won't get probably a recession like two quarters of negative growth within 2019, I think. But when we come into early 2020, very likely probability (INAUDIBLE) say that's a very high probability and that means growth will slow almost a year before. So that sort of a year now certainly. And that's when the fed typically stop hiking and then at one states down the line towards the end of next year, I could easily see them cut.</p><p>JOHNSON: So the fed is going to be cutting as the ECB is exiting. It's going to be an interesting middle conundrum (INAUDIBLE), isn't it?</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes, yes. I think its -- yes, exactly. And that's why you have to think Euro-dollar moves higher.</p><p>LACQUA: But Erik why would you just not hike as much instead of then -- you know, you use credibility. We've seen it here in Europe about 15 years ago. If you hike and then cut, the markets freak out.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. Well, you hike until you don't hike anymore, and then you wait for maybe six, nine months, and then you cut in the normal scenario, right? But I think the probability of -- I mean, and so this is my view of next year that at least that it's a high probability. But its -- if I were the fed, I would also hike now, but I would not say four hikes this year. I mean, I think what's in it for that?</p><p>LACQUA: The growth is good. What would happen in 18 months from now?</p><p>NIELSEN: So my -- there are two issues. Pure macro, half of the increase in private consumption in America has been funded for two years now by a drawdown in household savings, and they seems to its down 2.5%. So this is vulnerable. This is 70% of GDP in America, right?</p><p>Then you have the risks of policies, the trade stuff, and the fiscal expansion. And what does the fiscal expansion do for insurance and they'll buy to the 10-year? So, my view would be that there's certainly a risk that sudden this thing falls off quite measurable at sometime down the line.</p><p>LACQUA: What does it mean for -- so who would be hit, is it that? But this is regardless of tariffs and trade, or is it?</p><p>NIELSEN: So the underlying fundamentals would suggest to me that sometime next year you have a slowdown. Tariffs and trade raises the risk that it happens more abruptly and earlier.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you think the Euro goes up on this? I'm sorry, I'm trying to consider the other argument out, which is --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm shocked.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- as the fed is -- yes. Sorry. And as the fed has been hiking rates and the interest rate differential on the 10 years go wider and wider and wider, the dollar has gone down. So I'm just going to throw it out there. Does the dollar go up when the fed starts?</p><p>NIELSEN: No. No. No. Your --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOHNSON: But Euro dollar has gone up when the fed is hiking. They got this huge interest rate --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- differential, so --</p><p>NIELSEN: I don't think that's as powerful as the fiscal expansion. I mean, so --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- we had a -- we have a nice -- my colleague (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: -- has a great chart on the U.S. budget deficit adjusted for the cyclicals and need (INAUDIBLE) chart --</p><p>JOHNSON: The Euro has gone up because of the U.S. twin deficit?</p><p>NIELSEN: No, the dollar has gone down, right?</p><p>JOHNSON: OK.</p><p>NIELSEN: And that's probably the --</p><p>JOHNSON: No. No. But its --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. No. No. No. Because the dollar weakness more than as a Euro spends dollar. That's important too.</p><p>LACQUA: That's not how Draghi is feeling it.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. Yes, yes, exactly and rightly so. I mean look at the trade where the Euro has got up by roughly half of what your dollar has right. So its dollar is dramatic. But --</p><p>JOHNSON: The trade (INAUDIBLE) Euro is down because the (INAUDIBLE) hasn't moved or --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. It's been helping that's right, that's right. I mean, and I mean the other trading partner we have the sterling, right, and then we have the central Europeans and all the rest of it, so its, yes, but there then maybe it's a very big part of the story, right.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. This is trade where the Euro, I caught it up in time.</p><p>NIELSEN: With --</p><p>LACQUA: I'm so happy. There it is. It's there on the left.</p><p>NIELSEN: Right.</p><p>LACQUA: Between the --</p><p>NIELSEN: That's between the Euro Bank.</p><p>LACQUA: So that --</p><p>NIELSEN: So what's the problem, right?</p><p>LACQUA: What do we do from here?</p><p>NIELSEN: So that's put to my point is first for the ECB what's the problem, right?</p><p>JOHNSON: It's gone sideways. Those on the thin on radio it's gone sideways.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes. So, I think from where does it go from here? I think it will -- we will edge higher. Over this year if I have to -- I mean if I were basically a betting man, I would say maybe 5% or thereabouts. Nothing too dramatic.</p><p>JOHNSON: Somebody is already complaining about it now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Explain this.</p><p>NIELSEN: I mean, yes, they are and yet their export numbers are still growing faster than global trade and global GDP. So they're still getting market shares around the world. But of course it's nicer too -- if you're an exporter to have a weaker currency.</p><p>JOHNSON: Who's at the other day one of the ECB --</p><p>NIELSEN: And I'll prefer they didn't have, right. I mean --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. one of the ECB guys the other day was talking about the fact this is as good as it gets for the ECB better much on inflation restore coming through. The growth momentum story's been there, it's been fantastic. It gets harder from here.</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Do you buy that, or do you think the ECB's kind of can coast along for a little bit longer?</p><p>NIELSEN: No, I think that -- so, I think we are close to sort of the peak of Eurozone growth, which is not (ph) of 2% although the shop indicators suggest that it could actually move up above 2.5 towards to 3, right? I don't think its going get up there.</p><p>So I think we are sort of cruising and maybe hitting off a little bit. Yes. So the ECB, and then if you look a year out, if I'm broadly right on the U.S., the Europe will also have a hit, right. There's no --</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN: So then you see Euro zone growth drop back to 1.5, 1.7 or thereabout. So from the ECB point of view, yes, you can sort of remove the Q.E. and that -- but you won't get inflation up to 2% for a while.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. We could go on for about --</p><p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: -- 50 miles. OK. All right, Erik Nielsen Unicredit Group Chief Economist back on.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Also with us for the hour, he is Erik Nielsen and he is UniCredit Group Chief Economist.  </p><p>      So, Erik, thank you so much. Stay there, because we'll get to you in a second.  </p><p>      Richard, when it comes to the tech selloff --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  Good morning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  -- what exactly -- good morning to you -- what exactly freaked the markets? Is it that, you know, had a trajectory, where a lot of these stocks were going when you were driverless cars could go now next and now it's all hanging up in the air?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  No, I think you got a number of factors. I mean you've had the really large -- the really tech companies that have had, you know, one of the greatest runs they've ever had. You've got the prospect of increasing interest rates.  </p><p>      And then also, if you look at the stocks that are dependent on monetization of user data like Google and Facebook and Twitter, these are the ones that have most impacted. So I suspect it's more about these factors, combined with increasing fear of regulation in terms of what people can and cannot do with data that has been given to them by users that are causing the problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes, we also heard that the E.U. was probably considering a digital tax as a trade to this few (ph) kind of rages on. What would that look like?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  Great question. Very difficult to tell, I mean, I guess what they would look to do would be to impose a tax on revenues that have been derived in the region. That would be the simplest way of doing it as I presume.  </p><p>      But overall, I mean, my personal opinion is hold data issue is it will eventually blow over. And the reason why it will blow over is because there's a fundamental misunderstanding in my opinion in terms of how the internet works and users seem to have the opinion that the internet is free, isn't and never has been. What you're actually doing is just paying for service with personal data.  </p><p>      Once users get more accustomed to that, then I think that there will be an easier situation where you can choose. You pay the cash or you pay with personal data, and that's how I think it's going to evolve going forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Do you value these companies though at the same level if that is the case? Because, as you say, at the moment, there is this misapprehension that the service is free. But basically these are data monetization companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  Exactly. And actually, I think it is. As a matter of fact, the research that Radio Free Mobile has done over the last five years actually (INAUDIBLE) this out, which is that, you know, you have a choice. Let's just take for example, Google. Google has a choice. You could basically come to Google and say yes, you can use my personal data and I will use -- get your services for free or I don't want you to use my personal data, I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $5 a month for the service.  </p><p>      Now, obviously, these companies would set the pricing of that service at the level at which there should be no real impact on revenue overall.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Do you think there's a breakup risk here, Richard?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  In terms of?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Are these companies too big, too powerful, somebody pointed out to me earlier on, they spend a huge amount of money in terms of lobbying in Washington. They control huge sways (ph) of the technology sector across the United States and across the world. We've seen it in history, when companies and sectors become too big, there is a regulatory impetus that starts but ultimately ends up leading to breakup.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  I think it's this possibility, but it's a very distinct possibility. If you look at Google, your first question want to ask is, well, what am I going to break it up into? Because, you know, and there is a reasonable argument in this level of Google that it is a one-trick pony, but it does search and everything else is fairly minor.  </p><p>      As a result of that, you would have great difficulty breaking that up into its constituent parts. In the same, you could level exactly the same accusation at Facebook. Facebook generates almost all of its revenue off its social network, so the question is, what would you break it up into?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Let's also bring Erik Nielsen of UniCredit into the conversation. Erik, I know you don't look at this thing day out, but you must have a view on driverless cars and automation and even the end of cash, and the impact it has on the economy in 5, 10, 15 years. Does anything that happens in the last, you know, the last couple of days change that deal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I'm getting more and more nervous. I think we had maybe an overshot in terms of globalization after the crisis and through the crisis sort of extent and I see a lot of winding back of this. And I think what you're referring to and what we just talked about on the -- in the I.T. industry and the tech industries. I share sort of guy sort of skepticism here.  </p><p>      I mean, to some extent, these companies have been broken up in the sense that they're not free to operate in China and Russia, for example, right? There are positive words that we don't want this, right, and all the Europeans are saying a little bit, I don't really think you pay enough taxes because you shoveling through islands, so maybe, so we should say exactly as Richard said, maybe we should tax the pays with the revenues come in.  </p><p>      But this whole thing is not a smooth process, right? So you have to worry a little about this sort of how that impacts the economy in a negative way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  But we find ourselves in a situation where the Chinese, as long as you got -- they two sort of two buckets of tech stocks around the world at the moment, you got the kind of the U.S. bucket and you got the Asian bucket, which is largely the Chinese buckets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Europe doesn't have much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So it kind of falls into one of those two. The Chinese bucket is going to be made up of companies that are going to get bigger and, therefore, potentially stronger, whereas there is increasingly this regulatory taxation burden that is likely to be put on the U.S. once.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage -- are we heading down the road of a kind of trade war their tech versus our tech? Are we putting ourselves at a disadvantage?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I don't know if we -- yes, from a very sort of liberal kind of world view we are, in a sense, but I think what we have seen is some of the backlash to what's this in the (INAUDIBLE) of things and (INAUDIBLE) now where these companies seems to be if the reporting is correct, meddling with the political process.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So then I think most people will think, well, then there has to be some measures to take this back, right? So I -- and that's what I meant by what I said before. I don't think that taking it, but I think politically, it's understandable and probably desirable, but it's not smooth for the economy as this happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And, Richard, what are you watching out for in the next 74 hours? Will it be testimonies to kind of exactly understand where a lot of these big companies go from here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WINDSOR</emphasis>:  My personal suspicion is that things are -- that, you know, you had a bit of fuzz. People start to get worried about the use of data. Obviously, actually and if you look at the data leak, there is piece of happen where at 50, I think it was 50 million accountable data and 50 million of Facebook accounts made it into a private data analysis firm.  </p><p>      If you actually look at Facebook has actually changed its policy so you can no longer do that. So what I suspect will actually happen is there's going to be talk, a bit of softness, but I, you know, I think at the end of the day, we're coming into earnings season. Quite possibly, we're going to have another reason a good season from the big tech companies.  </p><p>      So as a result of that, I suspect a small correction, but then, you know, continuation of business as normal, at least for another quarter or so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, Richard, thank you so much. Richard Windsor there, founder of Radio Free Mobile and Erik Nielsen of UniCredit stays with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Erik Nielsen still with us from UniCredit. Erik, where's the tipping point in this story? The Chinese and we've -- we saw this sort of 18 months ago with the Davos speech that was delivered by the Chinese premier, have tried to play sort of the calm, rational actor in this story, but you just kind of wonder where they are being pushed to and at what point they start to retaliate, because that's when the game really starts. Where do you think that point is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I don't know, but I think there are a couple of things going on, right? The one part is that it's I think it's an irony that China is now the defender of free trade, right? At the end of the day, they have a lot of subsidized industries --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  -- and all the rest of it, and so the real tragedy for me here is that these are the protector of the (INAUDIBLE) lateral world have decided that they don't want to be, as the U.S., they don't want to really be the free trade champion anymore.  </p><p>      So, now, we are in this back room and ironically somebody getting sort of --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  They fills it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Job filling in, exactly, in a peculiar way. But where do this -- where do they draw the lines? It's impossible to say, because it's a big political decision for them at the end of the day. They have to do something, but I suspect they will retaliate very modestly, because they don't want I say the exactly --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  -- they don't want the trade war.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  In some ways, this feels very much like how we used to think about the cold war, escalation theory, deterrence.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  That kind of the language. Is that the direction we're going in, and is that a useful sort of way of thinking about this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Well, I think July (ph) -- I mean, let me start by saying, I think you could -- we haven't named it yet, but I think we already are in Cold War II, but more with Russia, right it's in a sense. And politically, this is completely cold war stuff we're going through now, and it can -- I don't see the breaking point there to where we stop this sort of escalation on the political side between. But this time around, compared to the original cold war, we have now China being a major player and the leading western (ph) power not being a leading player. So this is confusing, right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But Erik, you have American businessmen who basically yesterday said, look, $60 billion it will also hurt the U.S. economy. How can you quantify that? Do we know by how much?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Not at the top of my head. It's very, very little, I mean, if you're -- I mean, look, if you're doing the trade tariffs and you do sort of the steel and aluminum and you do a $60 billion on top of that, it is a decimal point on GDP at most, right. But the question is, if the Chinese retaliate and it comes back and forth a couple of times, well, then suddenly it could be.  </p><p>      There was a study by Obstfeld the IMF Chief Economist some years ago that estimates it that if you planted 20% tax -- import tax in America I think it was, on all Chinese imports, you could have something like half a percent cut to U.S. GDP by the exchange rate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  How would China retaliate? So even if they don't, you know, throw the fire on the other side, can they retaliate in measures that we don't really notice, but put investment in Europe? Is there actually -- can Europe benefit from this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean, it's all I was going to say, if the (INAUDIBLE) of course, how can they retaliate? I hope they retaliate just like they try to smooth Trump by maybe revoking some of the licenses for his daughters back in China or something, very symbolic, very sort of tell him you don't like what we do.  </p><p>      But the most serious question you ask, yes, I'm sure Europe can benefit instead and I think already, as I understand the conversations between particular Berlin and Beijing are in full flow on this. How can we at least prevent that we get down on the slippery slope to watch each other?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Does the Trump camp see that as being Europe ending up in China's camp? Europe is trying to figure out how it gets around the aluminum and steel tariffs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  If the White House perceives that the negotiations are in full flow and the Chinese and the Europeans are negotiating.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Does that isolate Washington even further?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, it does. I mean, it's the -- I forget who coined it, I mean, from America first (INAUDIBLE) alone, right. I mean, that idea then it's the problem is I don't know, but I -- my suspect that Trump and Ross (ph) and these people are don't really see things the same way we see them. They say, well, people are just being confused. The \"F.T.\" is up yesterday is saying that it's very -- calling some Europeans, it's very difficult, because he's so unpredictable Trump. I suspect if Trump reads the \"F.T.\" which should probably doesn't, he would say, that's good, that's what I'm messing around with them, right? And -- but this is strange. It's not good for the economy  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I mean, it could be seen as a win for the (INAUDIBLE). I know whether he reads the \"F.T.\", but I know he's watching, so I'm sure he's listening right now.  </p><p>      We'll get back to Erik shortly.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, still with us is Erik Nielsen of UniCredit. Erik, how does this translate into your world? Do you have the currency angle? Of you course you haven't said your angle, angle. Do you worry a little bit less about Saudi Arabia in terms of finances than you maybe did six, eight months ago because of the old price?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, for sure. Right. I mean there's -- I worry over less about them for two reasons. The oil price as you said and the fact that it feels like they're to reform and becoming closer to the west and reform the economy, which haven't been done. Whether they would be successful, I would -- I don't know, right. One has to be skipped but certainly a high oil price and this sort of stabilization is good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK. What does that mean? I mean the oil price, what is the metric when you look at the oil price inflation? Does it feed through inflation in the U.S.?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, yes, it does and that's best, right. I mean that's best and very clear. By you can say we've been asking for more inflation in America and Europe for a long time. We don't want inflation as cost push right. I mean, because oil prices go up.  </p><p>      That's bad inflation. Its -- we want inflation because the output closes and therefore demand push inflation higher, right. That's the -- that's what we really want. But what I meant by good news is that also in it for the west, you need a stable Middle East. And forever stay in Middle East you need oil prices and solar (ph) maybe this (INAUDIBLE) at least north of 50 probably.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Talking inflation, we just had U.K. CPI drop and maybe the wrong kind of inflation, because it's been driven by what's been happening with the pound. The data just came out a few minutes ago. The pound popping around a little bit on it.  </p><p>      I'm just going to my (INAUDIBLE) screen. The number going through at 2.7. Previously it was 3.0. It was surveyed to come through at 2.8. It's now come down to 2.7.  </p><p>      We do have a bank of England decision coming up in a few days' time. It's going to be interesting to see ultimately whether or not actually the markets price in the bank right in terms of the, A, the inflation expectations, and B, whether or not that isn't likely to lead to an ongoing rate hiking cycle. We'll see. We'll find out later on this week. Marconi is going to tell us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. And Erik would you bring over to my chart. Now this is basically, we're looking at DWI (ph) repeat function, we're also looking at traders and how much they feel the BOE can act. Do you feel like they can? So this is basically showing at least one of BOE rate hikes this year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Can they afford to even hike once?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I wouldn't if I were them. I think -- but I think they will. I mean I think is the -- yes, I think the U.K. economy is too weak, and they should look through the inflation at this stage. That would be my view. I think its -- but I think they have set themselves in motion that they have -- they've had the inflation numbers obviously and they've set themselves in most of it.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  No. No. No. The U.K. economy is running at -- it was running at 17 miles an hour without shaking, right? The kind of the outputs and it now running at 60 miles an hour without shaking. But if we run the economy 60 miles an hour, it starts to shake. We don't have the same potential growth rate we used to have. So the inflation story is a bigger risk therefore the banks should act earlier, shouldn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  If you're running at 60 miles an hour without shaking, maybe so. I'm looking more at maybe 30 and a lot of shaking.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK. (INAUDIBLE) and you're making the point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  But it's -- so I would -- yes, I don't see why you hurry. I mean the risk that it faces our control here is not very high. So I -- Look lets also (INAUDIBLE) whether the hike ones or not in a year makes no difference to the economy. That's just -- I mean the market gets very excited this thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  You know --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  In real life, 25 basis points at one is not important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  You're breaking our heart, Erik.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Oh sorry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Erik Nielsen with UniCredit staying with us. We'll talk a little bit more about what the market cares and doesn't care about.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Erik, what are we -- what is (INAUDIBLE) the impact of a cliff edge on the European E.U. economy after the U.K. leaves if we don't have the same ago aggregation of financial services in London, the access to those bit markets, those capital markets, ceases to be there for European companies. What is the downsize for Europe? I'm just trying to understand how strong a card the U.K. where place it ultimately has to play here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  It's very weak one, right, because it -- the U.K. is small in this context. I think there's days from day one, it believes that you cannot have most of sort of the settlements and the bit --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  -- on the financial outside the E.U. So there will be some pushback on this one. And there is on this specific issue a degree of also there's a benefit for us if you will. I mean there is a -- you can see how Frankfurt and Paris and Dublin, all other countries and other cities that sort of stopping to sort of the competing to get the financial industries in there. So I -- look, if Brexit is anything but a very soft one, it's a negative for all of us, little (INAUDIBLE) into my mind about that but more so for the U.K., right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So, I agree. I just wanting about if I run a company (INAUDIBLE) right funding or sell a bond or whatever it is I need to do. One of the things this happen is the financial crisis is that the U.S. capital markets have become bigger. One of the things that happened is the financial crisis is that the European capital markets have become smaller.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Now one of the things that happened after the financial crisis was that Europe said what we need to do is get deeper capital markets here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  One of the critical factors for our economy if we're going to take it forward from here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  The most obvious thing to do is to use one of the global financial centers within the time zone to generate that process. Yet we're about to see the cliff edge where for removes that for being a possibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. But in powered up you have the banking union and the capitalize (ph) union under construction, if you will.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes. Slow construction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, yes, exactly. But its -- I mean, the banking union has -- I mean from their point of view it's not been slow, but it's, you know, like a war right now. But the capitalize union is underway, right? And the credit will take some years for sure.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Erik Nielsen of UniCredit sitting alongside us here on the desk. Erik, so we're just having a little of a chat in the break, and we were talking about whether or not the fed is going to raise three or four and it kind of went, and I'm a bit worried about next year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Should the fed be cutting rates at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No, probably not. I wouldn't cut rates, but I think if I were a betting man, I think I would bet on a rate cut towards the end of next year. I mean, so people are thinking, how far do they keep going, and nobody is talking about the cost because I think there's a measure of probability that next year sees a significant slowdown.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Recession?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  You won't get probably a recession like two quarters of negative growth within 2019, I think. But when we come into early 2020, very likely probability (INAUDIBLE) say that's a very high probability and that means growth will slow almost a year before. So that sort of a year now certainly. And that's when the fed typically stop hiking and then at one states down the line towards the end of next year, I could easily see them cut.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So the fed is going to be cutting as the ECB is exiting. It's going to be an interesting middle conundrum (INAUDIBLE), isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, yes. I think its -- yes, exactly. And that's why you have to think Euro-dollar moves higher.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But Erik why would you just not hike as much instead of then -- you know, you use credibility. We've seen it here in Europe about 15 years ago. If you hike and then cut, the markets freak out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, you hike until you don't hike anymore, and then you wait for maybe six, nine months, and then you cut in the normal scenario, right? But I think the probability of -- I mean, and so this is my view of next year that at least that it's a high probability. But its -- if I were the fed, I would also hike now, but I would not say four hikes this year. I mean, I think what's in it for that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  The growth is good. What would happen in 18 months from now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So my -- there are two issues. Pure macro, half of the increase in private consumption in America has been funded for two years now by a drawdown in household savings, and they seems to its down 2.5%. So this is vulnerable. This is 70% of GDP in America, right?  </p><p>      Then you have the risks of policies, the trade stuff, and the fiscal expansion. And what does the fiscal expansion do for insurance and they'll buy to the 10-year? So, my view would be that there's certainly a risk that sudden this thing falls off quite measurable at sometime down the line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What does it mean for -- so who would be hit, is it that? But this is regardless of tariffs and trade, or is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So the underlying fundamentals would suggest to me that sometime next year you have a slowdown. Tariffs and trade raises the risk that it happens more abruptly and earlier.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Do you think the Euro goes up on this? I'm sorry, I'm trying to consider the other argument out, which is --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I'm shocked.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  -- as the fed is -- yes. Sorry. And as the fed has been hiking rates and the interest rate differential on the 10 years go wider and wider and wider, the dollar has gone down. So I'm just going to throw it out there. Does the dollar go up when the fed starts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No. No. No. Your --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  But Euro dollar has gone up when the fed is hiking. They got this huge interest rate --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  -- differential, so --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I don't think that's as powerful as the fiscal expansion. I mean, so --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  -- we had a -- we have a nice -- my colleague (INAUDIBLE) --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  -- has a great chart on the U.S. budget deficit adjusted for the cyclicals and need (INAUDIBLE) chart --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  The Euro has gone up because of the U.S. twin deficit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No, the dollar has gone down, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  And that's probably the --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  No. No. But its --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. No. No. No. Because the dollar weakness more than as a Euro spends dollar. That's important too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  That's not how Draghi is feeling it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes, yes, exactly and rightly so. I mean look at the trade where the Euro has got up by roughly half of what your dollar has right. So its dollar is dramatic. But --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  The trade (INAUDIBLE) Euro is down because the (INAUDIBLE) hasn't moved or --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. It's been helping that's right, that's right. I mean, and I mean the other trading partner we have the sterling, right, and then we have the central Europeans and all the rest of it, so its, yes, but there then maybe it's a very big part of the story, right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. This is trade where the Euro, I caught it up in time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  With --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I'm so happy. There it is. It's there on the left.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Between the --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  That's between the Euro Bank.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So what's the problem, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What do we do from here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So that's put to my point is first for the ECB what's the problem, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It's gone sideways. Those on the thin on radio it's gone sideways.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. So, I think from where does it go from here? I think it will -- we will edge higher. Over this year if I have to -- I mean if I were basically a betting man, I would say maybe 5% or thereabouts. Nothing too dramatic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Somebody is already complaining about it now.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Explain this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I mean, yes, they are and yet their export numbers are still growing faster than global trade and global GDP. So they're still getting market shares around the world. But of course it's nicer too -- if you're an exporter to have a weaker currency.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Who's at the other day one of the ECB --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  And I'll prefer they didn't have, right. I mean --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes. one of the ECB guys the other day was talking about the fact this is as good as it gets for the ECB better much on inflation restore coming through. The growth momentum story's been there, it's been fantastic. It gets harder from here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Do you buy that, or do you think the ECB's kind of can coast along for a little bit longer?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No, I think that -- so, I think we are close to sort of the peak of Eurozone growth, which is not (ph) of 2% although the shop indicators suggest that it could actually move up above 2.5 towards to 3, right? I don't think its going get up there.  </p><p>      So I think we are sort of cruising and maybe hitting off a little bit. Yes. So the ECB, and then if you look a year out, if I'm broadly right on the U.S., the Europe will also have a hit, right. There's no --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So then you see Euro zone growth drop back to 1.5, 1.7 or thereabout. So from the ECB point of view, yes, you can sort of remove the Q.E. and that -- but you won't get inflation up to 2% for a while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right. We could go on for about --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  -- 50 miles. OK. All right, Erik Nielsen UniCredit Group Chief Economist back on.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-97Y1-JDPT-T0M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

That's because the tech giants are not really interested in producing and selling goods, they are not interested in manipulating prices. What they are interested in is our digital footprint.</p><p>Tracking that footprint can happen many ways and, until recently, it had all been done with almost no oversight.</p><p>The internet browser is the first point of access. It starts picking up data on the sites a user visits frequently through search history, as well as the general configuration of a consumer's device - the operating system, the display resolution, the type of processor.</p><p>Most of the data harvesting happens on the website or the app, where \"cookies\" log the actions of users to build a profile. Littered across the web, these cookies are the building blocks of a digital ID that is available to the highest bidder on the web.</p><p>There is another layer of surveillance, where apps on mobile devices collect location information, which is critical for services like Google Maps, online food delivery and catching an Uber.</p><p>All this information is collected as part of a user's everyday interaction on the web and once combined with the personal infor-mation that we share on social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter, creates a comprehensive digital profile of an individual.</p><p>It's far from an exact science, no one other than the companies know how the algorithms work and how effective they are, but it's a business model that oils the engine of the surveillance economy and lines the coffers of Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>It also powers the essential trade-off of privacy for service that underpins the transaction model of the internet - lots of free services on offer as long as there is enough personal data there to be harvested.</p><p>There's no argument from the tech companies on that point, but it's a different story when it comes to making the trade-off as clear as possible to its users. \"User data helps us serve relevant ads, and these ads help fund our services and make them free for everyone,\" a Google spokeswoman said.</p><p>Google gives users control of how their data is used through the MyAccount website.</p><p>In 2017, Australians visited MyAccount.google.com more than 22 million times, the company said.</p><p>But it needs to do a lot more to convince regulators, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommending the companies seek explicit permission from users to collect their data and give consumers more control. According to Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi, it will get harder for tech companies to maintain the status quo, especially as the regulatory screws tighten globally. \"The US will itself put out privacy principles similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation,\" he said. \"And in the future, it doesn't matter what device you use, they will be subject to unified privacy standards.\" \"Every company is pretty much a data company and there is chance that we end up with the companies adopting a user-pay model, or a combined subscription style model, with the ultimate cost imposed on the customer and advertisers.\" So far the regulatory focus is on software, but it's only a matter of time before the scrutiny extends to hardware companies, including Apple. Kath Blackham, managing director of Australian voice experience agency Versa, says it's the rising tide of smart speakers and voice assistants that are going to be the next flash point.</p><p>With more than 1.5 million Australian households set to own a smart speaker (Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod) by the end of this year, these devices are another snooping opportunity for big tech.</p><p>\"People don't fully understand how these things work, and while you have to invoke the voice assistants to wake them up, the devices are always listening passively,\" Ms Blackham said. There are no clear guidelines on how intently these speakers are listening to conversations, and Ms Blackham said the next generation of these devices, like Facebook's Portal smart display, had screens and cameras.\"Google and Amazon don't give you any information about what data is captured and how it's captured. We should be able to demand more control off our data and what's happening to it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-d5a41b9aff6811e8b706f3f44f6441d9aa91316fa5cfc06efbdb4811e8f1bd05</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYN-5M91-F0JP-W1N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 15, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As well as the four-star Kensington Close, and the five-star Westbury in Mayfair, he most recently added the Hilton London Kensington, bought from Vincent Tchenguiz for \u00a3260m in 2018. Cola's holding company paid a \u00a360m dividend in 2015-16. The Kurdish-born hotelier, who fled Iraq when Saddam Hussein came to power, sold Covent Garden's 170-bedroom Kingsway Hall hotel in 2014 for \u00a3100m. A strong increase in the assets of his main UK company had initially prompted us to push Cola's wealth up to \u00a3269m this year, but the closure of his hotels during the coronavirus crisis leads us to scale that back to just a \u00a39m rise. We take account of other interests in calculating the Monaco resident's fortune. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   2019: \u00a3250m, 490=                   2019: \u00a3250m, 490=                   501= BILL, TIM AND POLLY GREDLEY AND FAMILY                   Property and horseracing                   \u00a3259m \u25b2\u00a318m                   </p><p>Gredley, 87, who grew up in London's bomb-ravaged East End, started property firm Unex. The operation, based near Newmarket, is now largely owned by his children, daughter Polly, 33, and his 34-year-old international showjumper son Tim, who last year married Irish Sky Sports presenter Rachel Wyse at Adare Manor in Limerick, with friends posting pictures on social media under the hashtag #gredwed. As well as a range of commercial premises in Cambridge, the company also owns property in Peterborough and the eye-catching 26-storey Unex Tower in Stratford, east London. The business made \u00a323.8m profit in 2018-19 and is worth its net assets of nearly \u00a3243.7m, up \u00a318.6m in a year. These include \u00a33m of art and a \u00a39.5m stable of racehorses, many of which are bred and kept at the family's Stetchworth Park Stud. We add nearly \u00a315m for other interests.</p><p>                   2019: \u00a3241m, 504=                   2019: \u00a3241m, 504=                   501= GUY AND JULIA HANDS                   Finance and hotels                   \u00a3259m \u25bc\u00a36m                   </p><p>Biting the hand that fed, dealmaker Hands, 60, said in February that the private-equity industry was \"not fit for purpose for the world we now live in\". After making \u00a3300m at Japanese bank Nomura, he set up London-based Terra Firma, investing nearly \u00a315bn since 1996. Guernsey resident Hands and his wife Julia, 60, co-founded a chain of 19 country house hotels, including Ettington Park in Stratford-upon-Avon. Their closure during the coronavirus pandemic is reflected in a cut. </p><p>                   2019: \u00a3265m, 470=                   2019: \u00a3265m, 470=                   501= DAVID MABEY AND FAMILY                   Construction                   \u00a3259m \u25b2\u00a328m                   </p><p>It is a classic tale of poacher turned gamekeeper. Mabey, 58, once spent eight months in jail because of bribes to Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime to secure bridge-building contracts. But last year three UK companies were provisionally found guilty of price-fixing of safety equipment - after a tip-off from Mabey's firm, which was one of the trio but escaped punishment as a result of its whistleblowing. His Reading-based industrial and property group made \u00a330.7m profit and saw its assets rise \u00a326.5m to \u00a3180.9m in 2017-18.</p><p>                   2019: \u00a3231m, 520=                   2019: \u00a3231m, 520=                   505 STEVEN FERGUSON                   Oil services and gas services                   \u00a3256m \u25b2\u00a36m                   </p><p>Last year Monaco-based Ferguson, 60, was revealed to be among the wealthy individuals earning a fortune from letting property via Airbnb and Booking.com in Edinburgh, where he owns nearly 30 residences.

London-based Joel, 70, gives his nationality at Companies House as Kittitian - a native of St Kitts - while Dutch national Danny, 68, lives in Monaco.

The duke has other estates including Dalkeith, near Edinburgh - the smallest at 2,200 acres. He is enthusiastic about green energy and has converted an abandoned open-cast coal site at Glenmuckloch into an energy park with wind turbines. A further eight turbines planned for the site will provide enough energy for 16,000 homes.</p><p>The 9th Duke, who died in 2007, left \u00a3320m in his will, bequeathing art treasures - among them, works by Gainsborough, Rembrandt and a number of Dutch masters - and antique furniture valued at \u00a3224m. But we cut that back to \u00a3150m, taking account of any likely tax bill. Parent company MDS Estates made \u00a331.7m profit in 2017-18, a rise largely due to a reappraisal of the family's land and other holdings, while its assets increased by \u00a323.2m to \u00a3166.9m.</p><p>                   2019: \u00a3230m, 522=                   2019: \u00a3230m, 522=                   508= GORDON SANDERS AND FAMILY                   Care homes                   \u00a3253m \u25b2\u00a33m                   </p><p>Sanders, 74, owns Essex-based Runwood Homes, which provides nursing and residential care across 72 UK sites.

Profits fell more than 70% to \u00a34.6m in 2017-18, but this was mainly due to directors' remuneration of \u00a320.1m.

Though well beyond shooting distance of Westminster, upon dispatching a magnificent stag, the former Tory leader named it \"Boris\". He socked it to his back-stabbers on another hunt the year before, too, when a deer he called \"Gove\" became target practice. Whether the heads were stuffed and mounted is open to speculation.

The family's Sableknight property company developed the former Times Newspapers headquarters in London in the late 1990s. It made a \u00a36.8m loss in 2018, when net assets fell by \u00a39.8m to \u00a3194.9m, a decline blamed on weak equity markets, but the family took a \u00a32.5m dividend. </p><p>                   2019: \u00a3258m, 483                   2019: \u00a3258m, 483                   511= DAVID BLOOD                   Finance                   \u00a3250m \u25bc\u00a3100m                   </p><p>Blood, 61, and former US vice-president Al Gore founded Generation Investment Management, which focuses on sustainable capitalism and has poured funds into online supermarket Ocado and work management platform Asana.

The lock-up garages operation came about by accident in 1975, when a friend suggested he should buy a block of lugs in south London. Realising the garage business was fragmented and not regarded seriously, Dudding single-handedly changed all that. He also owns several hundred retail units, more than 700 flats and has a range of commercial mews properties.</p><p>He is building homes on top of some of his garages. \"My strategy is to buy for long-term investment or rental income,\" he said, \"then look at that block of garages for development opportunities down the line, whether it's a pair of semi-detached houses, a small block of flats or a mews-style development.\" </p><p>                   2019: \u00a3250m, 490=                   2019: \u00a3250m, 490=                   511= MICHAEL GOOCH AND FAMILY                   Finance                   \u00a3250m No change                   </p><p>The acquisition of New York-based GFI Partners by BGC Partners in 2016 netted Gooch, 61, and his family \u00a3185m.

He floated the operation in 2005 and stayed on as chief executive until 2013.

She is said to have asked her son of his future bride, \"Are you sure about what you're doing to 400 years of bloodline?\", though she has rejected his accusation of racism as a publicity stunt. Emma, 34, is the force behind afternoon tea at Longleat, a pit stop from having your car's windscreen wipers yanked off by monkeys at the 9,000-acre Wiltshire estate's safari park.

It also began selling \u00a3120 testing kits for private use but soon suspended sales and \"volunteered a significant element\" of its testing capacity to the government, which was under pressure to sharply increase the number of tests for NHS workers. FitzGerald, 69, had previously said his company's focus on early diagnosis of cancer, heart conditions and infectious diseases, ideally before the onset of symptoms, would be a \"game-changer\" for healthcare. We suspect the pandemic will help Randox recover from a data-tampering scandal at its Manchester site which led to more than 40 drug-driving offences being quashed in 2018, so we raise FitzGerald's wealth slightly.

Other assets include an art and jewellery collection worth more than \u00a33m. His fortune has been put as high as \u00a3421m, but we are more cautious in our valuation, raising him by \u00a32m this year. He still owns Castlehyde, the 18th-century Cork mansion he bought in 2001 and spent three years renovating at a cost of (EURO)27m. The property was on the market at (EURO)20m for more than two years without attracting a buyer, leading to the price being dropped to (EURO)12.5m, and it was reported last year that the house was no longer up for sale.</p><p>                   2019: \u00a3204m, 596=                   2019: \u00a3204m, 596=                   589= SIR COLIN GILTRAP                   Car sales                   \u00a3206m \u25bc\u00a33m                   </p><p>Eighty-year-old Giltrap opened his first dealership, Auckland's Monaco Motors, while still in his mid-twenties in 1966, acquiring the Porsche distribution rights for New Zealand eight years later. The Kiwi later snapped up franchises for Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Mercedes and Jaguar and by the 1970s had added British operations such as Chelsea Mercedes. He also took a stake in Malaya Group before it became HR Owen, a leading UK luxury car dealer. Over the years, Giltrap has poured millions into motor sport, founding and funding the New Zealand team in the now defunct A1 Grand Prix series. His Giltrap Group is still his homeland's biggest car dealer and he owns 67% of the business, while his sons Michael and Richard, who run the outfit, have smaller holdings. We agree with the Kiwi National Business Review's 2019 rich list on the wealth of Giltrap, who divides his time between London and Auckland and was knighted in 2012 for services to motor sport and philanthropy.</p><p>                   2019: \u00a3209m, 583=                   2019: \u00a3209m, 583=                   589= FRANK HESTER                   Software                   \u00a3206m \u25b2\u00a346m                   </p><p>In his youth Hester, 54, wrote a computer program for his mother that allowed her to manage the payroll at the family business in about 10 minutes, rather than the usual two days.

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMN-64ca87e125cdc08567110accdb96ae1e793d7f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C91444CEB14 NWBKMN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-KX11-JBCN-41WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409145</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 winonadailynews.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWI-119d722623a2df9a6ef74f2c9fab4a564bc897d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C918AF8DD94 NWBKWI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-KWJ1-JBCN-426R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chippewa.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president, but there\u2019s no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy \u2014 and horse-trading with foreign leaders \u2014 is a core presidential duty.</p><p>The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p>In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care.</p><p>Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p>One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p>Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legally suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p>As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p>And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority.</p><p>Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\"</p><p>To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off.

Mit der Richtlinie PSD2, die dann in Kraft tritt, \u00e4ndert sich vom Zugang zum Konto bis hin zur Nutzung von Kreditkarten im E-Commerce einiges. Doch gerade die Schnittstellen zum Kundenkonto werfen noch etliche Probleme auf.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Von Karin B\u00f6hmert, Frankfurt</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung, 15.8.2019</p><p>Die Zeit wird knapp, denn am Samstag, 14. September, wird es ernst, wenn die \u00fcberarbeitete europ\u00e4ische Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) abschlie\u00dfend umgesetzt wird und somit greift. Sie stellt Banken, aber auch deren Kunden vor enorme Herausforderungen. Die Kreditinstitute arbeiten deshalb seit Monaten mit Hochdruck sowohl an der technischen Umsetzung der Anforderungen durch die Richtlinie, als auch an der Information ihrer Kunden, was sich k\u00fcnftig \u00e4ndern wird. Und da kommt einiges auf die Kunden zu, die gut beraten sind, sich eingehend mit den von den Banken etwa auf deren Internetseiten zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellten Informationen zur PSD2 zu besch\u00e4ftigen.</p><p>Zwei wesentliche Punkte</p><p>Zwei wesentliche Punkte ver\u00e4ndern die Beziehung zwischen Bank und Kunde durch die PSD2 grundlegend: zum einen die in der Richtlinie geforderte starke Kundenauthentifizierung nicht nur bei der Ausl\u00f6sung von Zahlungen, sondern auch beim Log-in ins Konto. Zum anderen der Kontozugriff durch Dritte. Waren zuvor die Bankdaten durch das Bankgeheimnis gesch\u00fctzt, m\u00fcssen nun kontof\u00fchrende Stellen, also alle Kreditinstitute von Privatbanken \u00fcber Direktbanken bis hin zu Sparkassen, Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken den Drittanbietern einen Zugang zum Konto ihrer Kunden zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen, wenn die Kunden ihnen daf\u00fcr eine Erlaubnis erteilt haben.</p><p>Der erste Punkt, die starke Kundenauthentifizierung durch mindestens zwei Faktoren, erfordert ein erhebliches Mitwirken des Kunden. Erste Erfahrungen d\u00fcrften Bankkunden im Online-Banking schon infolge der weitestgehenden Abschaffung der papierenen iTAN-Listen mit verschiedenen TAN-Verfahren gemacht haben. Bei der Photo-TAN etwa wird f\u00fcr die Nutzung am PC oder per Smartphone eine spezielle, auf den Seiten der eigenen Bank herunterzuladende App oder ein spezielles (zu bezahlendes) Leseger\u00e4t ben\u00f6tigt. Nach Eingabe der \u00dcberweisungs- oder Transaktionsdaten muss mit der Photo-TAN-App oder dem Leseger\u00e4t ein farbiger Barcode gescannt und mit der dabei erhaltenen Nummer (Code) die Transaktion freigegeben werden. Bei einem anderen Verfahren wird eine zweite App ge\u00f6ffnet, die eine sechsstellige Zahl generiert, die dann in die Online-Banking-App auf Knopfdruck \u00fcbertragen wird.</p><p>Verschiedene Ausnahmen</p><p>Online-Banking-Kunden d\u00fcrften sich \u00fcberwiegend schon an das neue Verfahren f\u00fcr Transaktionen gew\u00f6hnt haben, wie zu h\u00f6ren ist. Das ist auch gut so, denn den Regeln der PSD2 entsprechend m\u00fcssten Banken vom 14. September an allein schon den Zugang zum Konto ohne duale Authentifizierung ablehnen. Doch es gibt verschiedene Ausnahmen. So d\u00fcrfen Banken ihren Kunden den Zugang zum Online-Banking erleichtern, indem nach einem Log-in f\u00fcr maximal 90 Tage auf eine starke Authentifizierung bei weiteren Log-ins verzichten. Danach muss sich der Kunde wieder doppelt authentifizieren bei seiner Anmeldung ans Konto.</p><p>Wenn Banken aber feststellen, dass beispielsweise die gro\u00dfen Technologiekonzerne regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Daten des Kunden abgreifen, kann dem ein Riegel vorgeschoben werden. Die Genossenschaftsbanken bieten daf\u00fcr ihren Kunden ein Steuerungscockpit an, das Zugriffe von au\u00dfen dokumentiert, wie DZ-Bank-Vorstand Thomas Ullrich im Interview der B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung erl\u00e4utert hat (vgl. BZ vom 6. August). Die Bank k\u00f6nne dabei vorgeben, wie viele Tage sie die Zugriffsm\u00f6glichkeiten bereitstellen will, und nach diesem Zeitraum m\u00fcsse der Kunde jeden Zugriff genehmigen. Die Bank k\u00f6nne aber auch festlegen, dass der Kunde jede Zugriffsanfrage freigeben muss.</p><p>Der Kunde kann diese Zugriffsfrist auch selbst verk\u00fcrzen oder ganz aufheben, so dass immer mindestens zwei Faktoren zur Authentifizierung eingesetzt werden m\u00fcssen. Er gewinnt also die Kontrolle \u00fcber sein Konto zur\u00fcck.</p><p>Bei der Verkn\u00fcpfung von Apps der Banken etwa mit dem Smartphone des Kunden gilt diese bereits als \"dual\", so dass beim Log-in ins Online-Konto auf eine TAN-Eingabe verzichtet werden kann.</p><p>Enge Zeitspanne</p><p>Aber aufgepasst: Gem\u00e4\u00df PSD2 darf die maximale Zeitspanne ohne Aktivit\u00e4t (Session-Timeout) im Online-Banking nicht mehr als f\u00fcnf Minuten betragen. Banken m\u00fcssen diese Vorgabe umsetzen und sollten deshalb nicht den \u00c4rger der Kunden auf sich ziehen. Zur Verl\u00e4ngerung der Session reicht noch nicht einmal die Bewegung der Mouse aus. Vielmehr ist eine Transaktion erforderlich, die den Online-Banking-Server anspricht etwa durch den Abruf von Umsatzdaten oder den Aufruf der Zugriffsverwaltung.</p><p>Sind die H\u00fcrden im Online-Banking geschafft, kann es beim Bezahlen im E-Commerce mit Kreditkarten knifflig werden. Zus\u00e4tzlich zur Kartennummer und dem Ablaufdatum ist die Eingabe einer weiteren, auf der Kartenr\u00fcckseite stehenden dreistelligen Pr\u00fcfziffer, ab September hinf\u00e4llig - zumindest im europ\u00e4ischen Geltungsbereich der PSD2. Es sind daf\u00fcr dynamisch generierte Codes oder biometrische Verfahren wie ein Fingerabdruck erforderlich. Aber daf\u00fcr muss man die Kreditkarte bei der Bank, die die Karte ausgegeben hat, zun\u00e4chst in einem mehrstufigen Online-Legitimationsverfahren von Mastercard Identity Check oder Verified by Visa (zuk\u00fcnftig Visa Secure) einmalig registrieren. Das Problem: Nicht alle Kunden haben dies bisher getan und werden \u00fcberrascht feststellen, dass der Online-Einkauf nach Freitag, dem 13. September, \u00fcber das bisher gewohnte Verfahren nicht mehr m\u00f6glich ist und abgebrochen wird.</p><p>Gravierender aber d\u00fcrfte sein, dass viele H\u00e4ndler noch nicht in der Lage sind, die neuen Technologien beim Bezahlen mit Kreditkarte anzuwenden. Denn der Online-Shop muss nach dem Online-Einkauf beim Bezahlen eine Anfrage an die Bank senden. Diese \u00f6ffnet ein Eingabefenster im Browser des Kunden und informiert ihn, auf welchem Weg die Zahlung mit der Kreditkarte (oder Debitkarte) durch ihn freigegeben werden muss. Der H\u00e4ndler hat dabei keinen Zugriff auf die vom Kunden eingegebenen Daten. Sind die Eingaben korrekt, best\u00e4tigt das System, dass man der rechtm\u00e4\u00dfige Karteninhaber und dadurch der Kauf abgeschlossen ist.</p><p>H\u00e4ndler m\u00fcssen also die Abfrage der starken Kundenauthentifizierung implementieren, was viele noch nicht getan haben, auch weil sie daf\u00fcr eine Schnittstelle zur Bank brauchen. Da lauert das n\u00e4chste Problem, denn die Spezifikationen f\u00fcr die Schnittstelle hat der Regulator erst sp\u00e4t herausgegeben und sie sind auch nicht einheitlich in Europa. Es drohen Abbr\u00fcche im Online-Einkauf und Umsatzeinbu\u00dfen f\u00fcr den Online-Handel. Deshalb hat die europ\u00e4ische Aufsicht EBA den nationalen Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden vorgeschlagen, den 14. September nicht als hartes Datum zu sehen und Aufschub zu gew\u00e4hren.</p><p>Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell wankt</p><p>Die Schnittstellen spielen eine wichtige Rolle beim zweiten Punkt der PSD2, dem Kontozugriff durch Dritte. Dies sind u. a. Zahlungsausl\u00f6sedienste wie oben beschrieben oder Kontoinformationsdienstleister.</p><p>Doch halt: Durch die PSD2 ist der durch Banken mit einer dezidierten Schnittstelle frei zu \u00f6ffnende Zugriff allein auf das Kontokorrentkonto beschr\u00e4nkt. Damit ger\u00e4t das Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell etlicher etablierter und neuer Fintechs in Wanken. So leben Kontoinformationsdienstleister davon, die Daten von mehreren Kontotypen oder Konten eines Bankkunden, die dieser bei verschiedenen Instituten unterh\u00e4lt, zusammenzustellen und eine entsprechende kostenpflichtige Analyse anzubieten. Bisher funktionierte das durch das Auslesen der Online-Banking-Seiten (Screen Scraping) oder \u00fcber den uneingeschr\u00e4nkten Zugriff auf die FinTS- und andere bisherige Schnittstellen.</p><p>Doch die FinTS-Schnittstellen sind im Rahmen der PSD2 im Prinzip nicht mehr zul\u00e4ssig, und eine einheitliche europ\u00e4ische Schnittstelle gibt es noch nicht. Deshalb hat zum Beispiel die \"Berlin Group\" den NextGenPSD2-Standard als banken- und l\u00e4nder\u00fcbergreifende, harmonisierte Schnittstelle entwickelt. Die PSD2 schreibt vor, dass die richtlinienkonformen \"dezidierten\" Schnittstellen in einer dreimonatigen Marktbew\u00e4hrungsphase, also unter Produktivbedingungen bis zum Stichtag 14. September nicht nur getestet werden. Es muss auch nachgewiesen werden, dass sie funktionieren. Gelingt dies nicht, d\u00fcrfen Dritte als \"Fallback\" wieder \u00fcber die bisherigen Schnittstellen auf die Konten zugreifen.</p><p>Hier\u00fcber ist derzeit ein heftiger Streit entbrannt. So werfen Fintechs den Banken vor, die Schnittstellen quasi zu blockieren, also die Geschwindigkeit, Stabilit\u00e4t und Performance einzuschr\u00e4nken, wie dies Stefan Krautkr\u00e4mer, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer und Co-Gr\u00fcnder von FinTec-Systems unterstrich (vgl. BZ vom 9. August). Er pl\u00e4diert deshalb daf\u00fcr, in einer von ihm zeitlich nicht pr\u00e4zisierten \u00dcbergangszeit die bisherigen Schnittstellen nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Damit w\u00e4re aber dem Screen Scraping absehbar wieder T\u00fcr und Tor ge\u00f6ffnet, sollte es Banken technisch nicht gelingen, den Zugang auf die im Rahmen der regulatorisch festgelegten Funktionen oder Konten zu beschr\u00e4nken. Denn die PSD2 verlangt nur, dass Banken Girokontodaten zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen.</p><p>F\u00fcr Daten zahlen</p><p>In einer n\u00e4chsten Richtlinie nach PSD2 k\u00f6nnte die Schnittstelle auf gr\u00f6\u00dfere Datent\u00f6pfe, wie etwa Depotdaten, erweitert werden. DZ-Bank-Vorstand Ullrich zufolge w\u00fcrden die Regulatoren hier aber schon signalisieren, dass Fintechs und Technologieunternehmen f\u00fcr mehr Daten auch mehr zahlen m\u00fcssen, beispielsweise indem sie ihre Daten ebenfalls bereitstellen. Dann w\u00e4re wieder ein Level Playing Field zwischen Fintechs und Big Techs einerseits und andererseits den Banken hergestellt, deren Kundendaten, die weit \u00fcber das Girokonto hinausgingen, kostenlos abgefischt werden konnten.</p><p>----</p><p>Zuletzt erschienen:</p><p>- Berlin reguliert die Blockchain (13.

In his victory speech, he drew cheers by reiterating his plan to eliminate the unpopular Michigan Business Tax and replace it with a flat six percent corporate income tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His election caps a campaign many pundits thought improbable when launched. Snyder was a political unknown who ran in a Republican field crowded with familiar names. But his \"one tough nerd\" campaign ads and matter-of-fact approach to problem solving struck a chord with voters. He also reached out to independents early on.</p><p>The former president and CEO of Gateway Inc., Snyder set up venture capital fund Ardesta in Ann Arbor and helped create and lead Ann Arbor SPARK, a public-private economic development organization. He's always pursued lofty goals but usually quiets naysayers with concrete achievements. Snyder has quieted critics again, but much work remains. He'll be challenged by Michigan's deficit, high unemployment, and a history of political regionalism.</p><p>The following are excerpts from an interview conducted with Snyder shortly after he announced his candidacy.</p><p>Dividend: Why did you decide to run for governor, despite never having held office before?</p><p>Snyder: The most frequently asked question I get is, \"Why would you want to be governor?\" And the interesting part is the intonation as much as the question. People wonder why someone would want the job given the circumstances. But I really do, and it's for the intersection of three reasons. One, Michigan is an economic disaster. We're losing a million jobs this decade, we have (high) unemployment. We're losing a family every 12 minutes. Two, I believe there's a fundamental lack of leadership in Lansing. There's no clear direction, there's no vision, they're ignoring problems, and using Band-Aids instead of long-term, structural fixes. And they're in conflict instead of working together for the common good. Three, I don't believe that a traditional politician is the answer. I think [traditional politicians] come from a culture that's broken. We need to bring the knowledge and tools from the business world to get us on a positive track and fundamentally reinvent the economy in this state and in our government.</p><p>Dividend: We've heard plans to reinvent government before from others. How can you, as a political outsider, get that done?</p><p>Snyder: Look at the business world: We reinvent ourselves multiple times or we wouldn't be in business. There have been a number of periods where that's the case. You can look at the period we're in now, or look at the tech bubble period. You can identify multiple periods where if we didn't reinvent our practices we would have been put out of business. Those are the kind of skill sets we've learned that we need to apply to government. A simple case I like to talk about is the budgeting process. It's been an absolute failure in the state of Michigan. [The state government shut down twice in recent years when budgets were not agreed upon in time.] Your business would never survive if you did cost-based budgeting. There's where departments ask for money, say they're going to do a whole bunch of stuff, and then next year ask for more money so they can do more stuff.</p><p>What we need is outcomes-based budgeting, which lays out a set of outcomes to achieve. We would be held accountable and measured against other states and even other countries. We want to deliver results and tell people, 'This is how we're going to build up a budget. You, as citizens, customers, want to buy these services and deliver these outcomes.' They say you can't do that in government. Well, it's worked successfully in other places, why aren't we looking at it here? It's not impossible in government.</p><p>Dividend: You are a product of the new economy, or what we used to call the new economy, and you've lived in other states. You've also led a big tech company. What does Michigan need to do to rebound, and how would you get that done?</p><p>Snyder: We need to change the concept of government from bureaucracy to customer service. The role of government should be to serve our citizens and customers. And everything we do shouldn't be through the lens of, 'We're government and we're going to go out and do stuff.' It should be, 'If you're a citizen, how can we help you be more successful?' And within that we need to be much more competitive on our tax and regulatory system. The Michigan Business Tax is the dumbest tax in the United States. Our regulatory system is biased toward assuming people are bad and they need to be controlled, versus the average citizen is good and you need to deal with the exceptions. So we need to actually make a much more competitive playing field and reduce these Band-Aid things like incentives. If you have a competitive playing field, you don't need Band-Aids. The second thing is to go to the concept of value-for-money budgeting. What's the return on investment we're giving you? Why are we a good shopping choice? We need to be showing our worth to be on your shopping list.</p><p>Dividend: What did you learn at Ross that maybe you've applied to your career and your campaign?</p><p>Snyder: I learned a lot there. That's a tough question because it's blended so much into my life. It's just part of me. One thing I really appreciated was that most of the people I met in business school had work experience. Here I was, a kid of 19, working in teams with these people. And it was just an awesome experience when people who had divergent backgrounds developed the chemistry to work as a team. It's one of those soft things, but it was a critical skill set to learn.</p><p>I've faced the challenge of people saying I can't do something my entire career. Actually, I thrive on that. I built this plan to get three degrees in six years when I was 16. So I designed it to get my bachelor's when I was 19, my MBA when I was 20, and my law degree when I was 23. I was an adjunct professor in the business school teaching tax when I was 24, 25, 26. I'd show up and most of the people were older than I was. But that's an important lesson. Teaching working people isn't taking the position that you're smarter or better than anyone else. I just happen to have more knowledge in the field, and we're there to learn together. We're all solid people. People aren't better than one another. The question is, how can you take that knowledge and share those tools with other people so we can all learn together? That's the same kind of message I want to bring to government.</p><p>Terry Kosdrosky</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1114622157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51D1-JFK1-DYTH-G3R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1150\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>November 4, 2010 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
