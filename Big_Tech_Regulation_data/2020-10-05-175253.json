nitf:lede=\"true\">Governments should help fund independent journalism as part of efforts to combat false information online, a group of leaders from social media companies, media organisations and academia has said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its report, the High Level Expert Group on Fake News, set up by the European Commission, urged technology companies, authorities and publishers to adhere to a code of conduct and better share data on disinformation in order to tackle the problem.</p><p>But it stopped short of calling for immediate state regulation of social media platforms.</p><p>While similar recommendations have been made in the past, the report was described by contributors as significant because representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were among the signatories.</p><p>The study comes in response to allegations that trolls intentionally posted false information on social media with the intention of influencing a series of elections and political events in Europe, such as the Brexit referendum, the refugee crisis and the French presidential elections.</p><p>The report recommended that among a raft of measures to tackle the problem, EU member states should increase investment in training journalists, supporting fact-checkers and improving the public's ``media and information literacy''.</p><p>It also suggested authorities support ``substantial media pluralism'' through a combination of supporting freedom of expression and providing ``appropriate forms'' of ``indirect and potentially direct support'' for private sector media organisations.</p><p>Despite its name, the group also called for an abandonment of the term ``fake news'', saying it was a ``restrictive and misleading'' term that been ``appropriated and used misleadingly by powerful actors to dismiss coverage that is simply found disagreeable''.</p><p>Madeline de Cock Buning, chairwoman of the group, called the recommendations a ``great leap forward''.</p><p>She said: ``I am very pleased with our results, especially the commitment of all stakeholders, including online platforms, on the steps we advise the Commission to take.''</p><p>Stephen Rae, editor-in-chief of Independent News and Media and one of the High Level Group's 39 members, said the report was an ``important first step in a pan European approach'' to the the spread of false information.</p><p>``This report recommends that European countries adopt a concerted and co-ordinated approach to address the growing disinformation online.</p><p>``The big tech platforms will have to adhere to a Code of Conduct aimed at diminishing the amount of disinformation online and promoting quality content,'' he said.</p><p>The group's recommendations will be used in the preparation of new EC plans to tackle the spread of disinformation, which are due to be published in spring.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He hasn't actually come out in support of it; he's just said he'd study the issue. My read is that he knows as well as O'Rielly did that this mumbo-jumbo isn't going to fly, but he's not going to come out and say so in public because he doesn't want to end up like O'Rielly. Even if Trump gets a second term, I wouldn't be surprised if Pai hemmed and hawed and stalled as long as he could before trying to actually take a side. </p><p>And what side he came down on would probably have a lot to do with whether he still wanted another term or figured he'd done enough and was ready to go back to Verizon. None of this should be interpreted as praise or defense of Pai; at best, he's a coward who's just going along with this to appease Trump.In second place, it's Bloof[3] with a response to a tiresome rant[4]:Is there a quicker way to stop people taking you seriously than using the term 'SJW' to describe people you disagree with? It's certainly up there with 'As a libertarian, I think...', 'The free market will...' and 'the marketplace of ideas'.For editor's choice on the insightful side, we start out with That One Guy[5] responding to some pushback on the idea that the TikTok debacle gives China an excuse to mess with American companies, on the basis that China already does so[6]:There's a world of difference between messing with a company but having to keep at least some plausible deniability during the process should you get caught, and therefore being limited in what you can do, versus being given free reign to screw with companies because if someone tries to call you on it you can just point to what they did and demand that they explain why it's okay for them to do something but not you.Next, we've got xyzzy[7] responding to the opposite argument about China \u2014 the idea that because it bans stuff, the US should too[8]:Ah, the old, because \"China has an authoritarian regime, that bans a whole bunch of stuff, so the USA should become an authoritarian regime...\" argument? How about, \"the USA is a bastion of free speech that the rest of the world looks up to, which makes China look bad in comparison\" approach? Oh, I forgot, Trump burnt that boat a while back.Over on the funny side, our first place winner is an anonymous commenter who found himself caught in the web of Evil Big Tech[9]:Google made me write this, I have no control over my own actions... ... hold on, they're telling me that I am just supposed to say that 'big tech good' and leave out that they're making me do it. Just ignore the part about me being controlled... they're telling me that I did this of my own free will and to let you all know that.In second place, it's a response to the comment from Bloof that won second place for insightful, with That One Guy[10] answering his question about red-flag terminology[11]:'Sheeple' might get that result quicker, but only just.For editor's choice on the funny side, we start out with an anonymous comment about the trademark dispute between Ubisoft and Monster Energy[12]:To one degree or another I associate both Monster Energy and Ubisoft with upset stomach, so there's some legitimate chance of confusion.Finally, we've got kallethen with a response to the Walmart press release about TikTok which was so rushed it quoted the company as saying... \"Ekejechb ecehggedkrrnikldebgtkjkddhfdenbhbkuk\"[13]:I have to admit, the person writing Walmart's press release sure did sum up my thoughts on this whole debacle.That's all for this week, folks!

In first place, it's a long comment arguing that we weren't hard enough on MEP Axel Voss[2]:'Why Does MEP Axel Voss Keep Lying About Article 13?' Is that a rhetorical question? Because the answer is blindly obvious from where I'm sitting, and applies to him and all the others like him to keep making blatantly false arguments and claims: Because it's impossible to defend it honestly, and he(and others like him) is so contemptuous of the public that he has no problem lying straight to people's faces if it means getting what he wants.This is an astounding level of ignorance on so many levelsNo. The time for 'maybe he doesn't understand what he's talking about' benefit of the doubt is well past. </p><p>At best he's grossly incompetent in not doing the slightest bit of research into a bill he's heavily supported, but far more likely is that he's not being 'ignorant' when he makes blatantly incorrect statements, he's being dishonest, and deserves to be called out as the liar he is every single time he does it.Instead, he has to play this charade, where he makes these ridiculous and easily debunked statements to support an unconscionable law that will lead to massive internet censorship and change the very fundamental nature of the internet itself.And again, no. He does not 'have to' lie to people's faces and make dishonest arguments, he chooses to. No one is forcing him to lie and engage in dishonest tactics, so I see no reason to soften the language describing such acts in any way. He does not 'have to' lie, he deliberately chooses to lie.In second place, it's some extended thoughts on our post about Elizabeth Warren's big tech breakup plan[3]:Need to work on those prioritiesMeanwhile, if Warren were truly concerned about \"monopolies\" and a lack of competition, why isn't her plan looking at the lack of competition in the broadband and mobile markets -- cases where we have legitimate competition problems due to bad regulatory policies going back decades?I was thinking this very thing the entire article. She wants to bust up monopolies that are harmful to the public? Then maybe put Google, Amazon and Facebook on the backburner and start with companies where in large numbers of cases people aren't signed up with them because they're popular, but because it's either them or nothing. If someone really doesn't want to use Facebook the fact that it's popular doesn't mean they have to, as there are plenty of alternatives, but if the only choice of actual broadband in your area comes from one company whether you like them or not doesn't matter, it's either them or no internet, which is dramatically more severe than simply 'no using this platform for social media'. She wants to crack down on monopolies that are harmful to the public? Great, there are much better targets to start with, and I'd love for someone to point that out to her, if only to see her reaction and whether or not she'd be willing to go on the record as supporting the idea of going after Comcast and company for their respective monopoly positions.For editor's choice on the insightful side, we start out with a comment from Qwertygiy, pushing back against the assertion that if copyright expired on the death of the creator, it would incentivize the murder of creators[4]:If an estate is passed down to heirs at the death of the owner, there would be an incentive for heirs to kill the owner of a valuable estate. If a political office is put up for election upon the death of the holder, there would be an incentive to kill the holders of a valuable political office. If funeral homes are paid upon the death of a person, there would be an incentive for funeral homes to kill random people. Oh... wait... all of that is already true, and we have laws that are very effective deterrents against any of that from happening.Next, it's That Anonymous Coward[5] arguing that, given the assault on fair use and public domain by copyright maximalists, a good first step in response would be to roll back copyright terms[6]:If fair use is such a burden, let us roll back the expansive handouts of extensions we've given them. It is supposed to benefit us but I am really hard pressed to see how the public is getting any benefits. Laws killing memesLaws killing content they don't controlLaws killing technological advancement Fair use is so very mean to them... if we just did away with it then that damn dancing babies family would have coughed up the $150K the law says we deserve! That video cost us trillions of dollars in losses!! Lets take back the extensions they wanted, because they have tormented those of us who agreed to grant them exclusive rights for a limited time in exchange for fair use ...e public domain, they've been trying to kill fair use and they had killed the public domain for a very long time. Let us go back to a simpler time where 'limited time' didn't mean 4 human life spans.Over on the funny side, our first place winner is Boba Fat[7], who responded to Steven Spielberg's opposition to Oscars for Netflix movies, and specifically to another commenter noting that \"we've always done it this way\" is a bad justification for anything[8]:Nonsense! We've always used that as our justification! We shouldn't change it now.In second place, we've got Toom1275[9] with another response to Spielberg[10]:Someone should call Jurassic Park and let them know they're missing their dinosaur.For editor's choice on the funny side, we start out with a comment from Mike Read[11], who was struck by one of our headlines about Europe[12]:Clash Of EU's Poorly Thought Out Laws Is this a new mobile game?And last but not least, we've got a comment from David about the shame of the NSA[13]:Things the NSA should not be proud of The Clipper chip and the Clapper chap.That's all for this week, folks!Permalink[14] | Comments[15] | Email This Story[16] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/user/thatoneguy\">https://www.techdirt.com/user/thatoneguy</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0

Some proposals discussed in political circles are truly radical. In the US, for example, on 8 March presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren stated[2] that if elected, she would introduce laws to break up the so-called 'Big Tech' and give regulators the power to unwind anticompetitive mergers. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager - who is widely viewed as one of the most aggressive enforcers of competition policy in the digital sector - said that breaking up Internet giants would be the 'last resort' under EU law, and that the European Commission is focused on using existing antitrust rules to rectify market behaviour. The Furman Report, whilst falling short of suggesting break up measures, makes far reaching, in some cases entirely new, recommendations for the government. If implemented, they would amount to a radical overhaul of the UK competition rules in the digital sector which would be unprecedented in the current regulatory landscape. In many respects the report chimes with a number of proposals suggested by the CMA on 25 February and summarised here[3]. Summarised below are the key Furman Report proposals.Creating a new digital markets unit (either independent or as a function of an existing authority/regulator) with specific powers (i) to set a code of conduct for companies with 'strategic market status'; (ii) on data mobility and open standards; and (iii) to secure access to non-personal anonymised data. Adapting the merger control rules so that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) can 'better stop digital mergers that are likely to damage future competition, innovation and consumer choice'. This would include an obligation on digital companies that have been designated with a strategic market status to make the CMA aware of all intended acquisitions, the CMA giving priority to the scrutiny of mergers in digital markets and, most importantly, the CMA's assessment taking account of the scale as well as the likelihood of harm. Strengthening regulators' competition enforcement powers so that breaches can be dealt with more quickly and easily, adjusting also the standard of judicial review for antitrust infringements and use of interim powers. Launching a formal CMA market study into the digital advertising market 'which is dominated by two players and suffers from a lack of transparency'. Creating a new digital markets unitOne of the most radical proposals is the establishment of a digital markets unit, either as a function within the CMA or Ofcom, or as an independent body linking to both. The unit would have a remit to use tools and frameworks that will support greater competition and consumer choice in digital markets, and backed by new powers in legislation to ensure they are effective. Significantly, this proposal would involve the unit developing a code of competitive conduct - notably with the participation of stakeholders - applicable 'only to particularly powerful companies', i.e. those designated as having 'strategic market status' The panel's recommendation chimes with the notion of 'participative antitrust' promoted by Nobel-Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole as a means of addressing competition problems in digital markets. The unit would pursue personal data mobility and systems with open standards 'where these will deliver greater competition and innovation'. Addressing the perceived challenges of adapting the regulatory framework to the challenges of a fast moving sector, the unit would also be empowered to impose measures where a company holds a strategic market status - with enduring market power over a strategic bottleneck market.Adapting the UK merger control rulesAnother radical set of proposals relate to mergers; for the CMA to:Further prioritise scrutiny of mergers in digital markets and closely consider harm to innovation and impacts on potential competition in its case selection and in its assessment of such cases; Require digital companies that have been designated with a 'strategic market status' to make the CMA aware of all intended acquisitions (this mirrors a similar step proposed in Australia, which, like the UK, operates a voluntary merger control regime); and Update its merger assessment guidelines to reflect the features and dynamics of modern digital markets, to improve effectiveness and address under-enforcement in the sector.As detailed in our February Global trends in merger control enforcement report[4], the policing of 'killer acquisitions' - where large firms buy up smaller players who have the potential to become rivals - is currently a hotly debated topic. The solution: a change to legislation to allow the CMA's merger assessment to use a more economic 'balance of harms' approach which takes into account the scale as well as the likelihood of harm in merger cases involving potential competition and harm to innovation. It will be interesting to see how this novel proposal is received by the Government. It will be considering it alongside the suggestion in a 9 March House of Lords Select Committee on Communications report Regulating in a digital world[5] that the Government consider implementing a public-interest test for data-driven mergers and acquisitions, namely the management of the accumulation of data, allowing the CMA to intervene.Strengthening antitrust enforcement powersCritical of the infrequent use of enforcement powers and the long duration of cases, the panel's solution is for:The CMA to amend its procedures and administrative rules to facilitate greater and quicker use of interim measures to protect rivals against significant harm; A change to the review applied by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to antitrust cases, including interim measures, to more limited standards and grounds, 'more closely related to that of judicial review', and the introduction of more independent CMA decision-making structures for antitrust enforcement cases, if appeal standards are changed; Competition and consumer law enforcers to have sufficient and proportionate information gathering powers; The CMA to continue to prioritise consumer enforcement work in digital markets, and alert government to any areas where the law is insufficiently robust; and The CMA to carry out a retrospective evaluation of selected cases not brought and decisions not taken (particularly those relating to potential abuse of dominance), where infringements were suspected or complaints received, to assess how markets have subsequently evolved and what impact this has had on consumer welfare.The panel also flags potential concerns over the greater use of personalisation, 'in particular personalised pricing, where companies use their data-driven insights into consumers to set prices according to the individual's willingness to pay'. It prompts the government, CMA and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to continue to monitor how use of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence evolves to ensure it does not lead to anti-competitive activity or consumer detriment, in particular to vulnerable consumers.A market study into the digital advertising marketPressure is mounting on the CMA to conduct a market study into digital advertising. This latest report follows an earlier, February, independent report, The Cairncross Review: a sustainable future for journalism[6], which recommended the CMA conduct a market study into the online advertising industry, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport's, Jeremy Wright, statement[7] to the House of Commons of the same day fully supported a CMA market study 'to examine whether the online marketplace is operating effectively, and whether it enables or prevents fair competition' and the 9 March House of Lords report repeating the call for a market study into digital advertising to see how the market is operating and to ensure that it is 'working fairly for consumers and businesses'. The panel would like to see the CMA's market study encompass the entire value chain. 'The market operates through a complex chain of advertising technology layers, where subsidiaries of the major platforms compete on opaque terms with third party businesses.' What will the CMA do? With limited resources, the nature of Brexit will be determinative. Should a deal be agreed with an implementation period or there is a significant extension to the UK's EU membership, the CMA's clear desire to intervene 'to ensure digital markets evolve in consumers' interests' articulated in its Annual Plan 2019/20[8] makes a market study very probable. However, so long as the outcome of EU exit negotiations remains confused, the CMA will shrink from prioritising such 'new discretionary work'. A no deal scenario, requiring the CMA to immediately divert staff to casework returning to the UK from Brussels, is likely to substantially delay any start date. Indeed, the CMA's statement[9] in response to the Furman report reiterates that 'its ability to launch new projects is heavily dependent on the outcome of EU Exit negotiations'. The Chancellor's 13 March Spring Statement 2019[10] notes that, subject to an orderly exit from the EU and therefore resources, the CMA 'will carry out a review to assess how regulation affects competition in the UK business environment' and he has asked[11] the CMA to prioritise a decision.International engagement and cooperation.Noting the international nature of the problem, the panel encourages the UK to take the lead in ensuring competition authorities share best practice and develop a common approach to issues. This fits with the CMA's ambition to strengthen its international profile. See all documents relating to the panel's review here[12], and the CMA's press release welcoming the report's recommendations here[13]. Indeed, many of the suggestions in the report will be well received at the CMA since, as the CMA itself has noted[14], 'many of the proposed reforms to the competition regime announced last month by CMA Chairman Lord Tyrie are supported by the panel's recommendations'.

The UK government is expected to formally respond to Furman Report in the summer.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

How should we measure success? What would laws on data portability look like and how would they be policed?</p><p>Of course, the Treasury may not accept his recommendations either - not least at a time when the Brexit process presents the mother of all distractions for civil servants.</p><p>Britain's political system remains so fragile too that Philip Hammond could easily be toppled from office within weeks. Who knows how his successor might choose to act instead?</p><p>Nevertheless, the report - which also includes a proposal for the UK to engage internationally on these issues - represents an important milestone in Whitehall's evolving attitude towards the Big Tech companies, which has become increasingly critical.</p><p>Around the globe - from Brussels and Paris to Washington DC and beyond, there have been similar grumblings for a while now.</p><p>On this side of the Atlantic, Europe's failure to build its own tech giants has emerged as a particular bone of contention in the EU, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/08/01/obamas-economic-guru-chosen-probe-uk-tech-market/\">Margrethe Vestager,</url> Europe's Competition Commissioner, has become\u00a0arguably the US technology industry's most powerful foe.</p><p>It would be virtually impossible for a new player to match Google's overarching supremacy over the data it holds on us.</p><p>Globally, the only companies which have managed to emerge as serious contenders to rival the Silicon Valley giants are in China, where challengers like Tencent and Alibaba have been assisted by Beijing's policy to cultivate domestic tech champions and push away the US web giants.</p><p>Either way, this is likely to be just the start as other governments closely scrutinise Mr Furman's proposals to formulate their own policy response while Silicon Valley limbers up to defend its corner.</p><p>That's why this one is likely to run and run.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52538189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-9481-F021-6554-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

A number of objections were raised by CSAs and the DPC engaged in a consultation process with them. However, following consultation a number of objections were maintained and the DPC has now referred the matter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) under Article 65 of the GDPR.\"<br/>Under the regulation's one-stop-shop mechanism, cross-border cases are handled by a lead regulator - typically where the business has established its regional base. For many tech companies that means Ireland, so the DPC has an oversized role in the regulation of Silicon Valley's handling of people's data.<br/>This means it now has a huge backlog of highly anticipated complaints relating to tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and indeed Twitter. The regulator also continues to face criticism for not yet 'getting it over the line' in any of these complaints and investigations pertaining to big tech. So the Twitter breach case is being especially closely watched as it looks set to be the Irish DPC's first enforcement decision in a cross-border GDPR case.<br/>Last year commissioner Helen Dixon said the first of these decisions would be coming \"early\" in 2020. In the event, we're past the halfway mark of the year with still no enforcement to show for it. Though the DPC emphasizes the need to follow due process to ensure final decisions stand up to any challenge.<br/>The latest delay in the Twitter case is a consequence of disagreements between the DPC and other regional watchdogs which, under the rules of GDPR, have a right to raise objections on a draft decision where users in their countries are also affected.<br/>It's not clear what specific objections have been raised to the DPC's draft Twitter decision, or indeed what Ireland's regulator has decided in what should be a relatively straightforward case, given it's a breach - not a complaint about a core element of a data-mining business model.<br/>Far more complex complaints are still sitting on the DPC's desk. Doyle confirmed that a complaint pertaining to WhatsApp's legal basis for sharing user data with Facebook remains the next most progressed in the stack, for example.<br/>So, given the DPC's Twitter breach draft decision hasn't been universally accepted by Europe's data watchdogs it's all but inevitable Facebook -WhatsApp will go through the same objections process. Ergo, expect more delays.<br/>Article 65 of the GDPR sets out a process for handling objections on draft decisions. It allows for one month for DPAs to reach a two-thirds majority, with the possibility for a further extension of another month - which would push a decision on the Twitter case into late October.<br/>If there's still not enough votes in favor at that point, a further two weeks are allowed for EDPB members to reach a simple majority. If DPAs are still split the Board chair, currently Andrea Jelinek, has the deciding vote. So the body's role in major decisions over big tech looks set to be very key.<br/>We've reached out to the EDPB with questions related to the Twitter objections and will update this report with any response. Update: In a statement, Jelinek, said: \"I can confirm that the Irish DPC has triggered an Art 65 procedure and that the EDPB will work on this issue [as] foreseen in Art 65 GDPR (dispute resolution by the board) within the given timeframe.\"<br/>The Article 65 process exists to try to find consensus across a patchwork of national and regional data supervisors. But it won't silence critics who argue the GDPR is not able to be applied fast enough to uphold EU citizens' rights in the face of fast-iterating data-mining giants.<br/>To wit: Given the latest developments, a final decision on the Twitter breach could be delayed until November - a full two years after the investigation began.<br/>Earlier this summer a two-year review of GDPR by the European Commission, meanwhile, highlighted a lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement. Though commissioners signalled a willingness to wait and see how the one-stop-shop mechanism runs its course on cross-border cases, while admitting there's a need to reinforce cooperation and co-ordination on cross border issues.<br/>\"We need to be sure that it's possible for all the national authorities to work together. And in the network of national authorities it's the case - and with the Board [EDPB] it's possible to organize that. So we'll continue to work on it,\" justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, said in June.<br/>\"The best answer will be a decision from the Irish data protection authority about important cases,\" he added then.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1422157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-8NT1-JBYT-H311-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are some deeply dystopian concerns occupying Mr Soros and other likeminded critics, including the prospect that \"IT monopolies\" could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\". But from an investment perspective, perhaps the most tangible part of Mr Soros's Davos tirade was his argument that big technology companies are bad for competition and consumers, and \"undermine the efficiency of the market economy\".</p><p>Because \"Facebook and Google effectively control over half of all internet advertising revenue\", content providers have to use their platforms and \"accept whatever terms they are offered\" helping these big tech firms generate \"exceptional profitability\". In Mr Soros' view they are \"near-monopoly distributors\" and should be regulated as though they were public utilities with the objective of \"preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access\".</p><p>What's more, the tech titans' control of data and their ability to use it to manipulate users for \"their own commercial purposes\" allows them to \"use discriminatory pricing to keep for themselves more of the benefits that otherwise they would have to share with consumers\".</p><p>The mounting concern about tech giants that exploit \"network effects\", such as the so-called FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), comes at a time when a broader rethink about the role of anti-trust law appears to be under way. A recent Brookings Institute paper provides some stark numbers to illustrate the growing concentration in many industries, including IT. Indeed, the share of US GDP accounted for by Fortune 500 companies has increased from 58 per cent to 73 per cent since 1980, and whereas the top 60 companies accounted for less than a fifth of GDP back in 1954, now the top 20 alone account for over a fifth.</p><p>                      \"IT monopolies\" could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\"                    </p><p>The problem with this, according to the Brookings paper, is that increased concentration may have benefited corporate profits at the expense of wages, consumer welfare and business investment. Indeed, the paper points out that \"labour and capital share have been declining simultaneously between 1984 and 2014, offset by rising profits in the non-financial corporate sector\".</p><p>While the enforcement of anti-trust laws experienced a shift away from broader consumer welfare and political considerations from the 1970s, the Brookings paper sees a brewing populist backlash and \"recent developments on Capitol Hill suggest [that] a serious re-evaluation of the purposes and powers of antitrust law and enforcement has begun\".</p><p>A key reason this debate is relevant to investors is that the rise in monopolistic corporate power may be an important factor behind elevated levels of profitability in the US and other developed markets. That means changes in anti-trust laws could have a real, albeit slow and grinding, impact on equity market returns. Arguably of more immediate significance, though, is the fact the FANGs now appear clearly in many influential people's sights. Given their popularity as investments and their weighting in key US and global indices, that's significant. The issue is succinctly summed up by Jonathan Ruffer in the latest investment view from his eponymous firm.</p><p>\"Two thousand years ago, stability was threatened by marauders who could overpower the local authority of a distant power. Today, those marauders take a different form: they are the corporate 'disruptors' - the Amazons, Facebooks, Twitters, Ubers which have discountenanced governments, who are unable to stop them conversing across borders, changing the way business is done, how conversations are constructed, all the while avoiding tax. In many investment climates, they would trade at low ratings - the judgement being the speed at which they could grow while conditions remain favourable, counterbalanced by the danger of their business model being de-railed by non-market forces. Today's market looks only at the element which is benign for the disruptors - but there will be a fight back. We are already seeing one against Uber where the authorities are increasingly imaginative in their resistance to their business model. They remain dangerous investments - remember Minister Fouquet, who overreached himself on seventeenth century France's milch cows, and who hosted a dinner for Louis XIV, and 7,000 others. Too lavish, thought the king, and Fouquet spent the next 19 years in prison, no doubt on a modest price/earnings ratio.\"</p><p>   Where to find the pieces mentioned:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/\">George Soros Davos speech transcript, 25 Jan 2018</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/\">A policy at peace with itself: Antitrust remedies for our concentrated, uncompetitive economy, William A Galston and Clara Hendrickson, 5 Jan 2018</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-economic-forum/\">Ruffer investment review, Jonathon Ruffer, Jan 2018</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-41091653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RMJ-B8S1-JCJY-G1P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><timeReceived>11:47 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Among them is consumer goods giant Amazon (US:AMZN), which is facing criticism from the American Federal Trade Commission, House Judiciary Committee as well as the wrath of the European Union Commission. But to tighten their grip on Amazon, these regulators face a difficult battle. Current competition laws are designed to protect the consumer, meaning Amazon - which has pushed down prices, pioneered online shopping and made life easier for its millions of customers - is on the right side of regulation. As Lina Khan argues in her Yale Law Journal article 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox', to regulate the big tech companies, competition laws needs updating. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In painstaking detail in the article, which catapulted Ms Khan from law student to 'Amazon's number one enemy', she argues that the antitrust laws drafted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer appropriate for the modern market. She says they are designed to assess competition according to consumers' short-term interests, rather than the health of the market as a whole. Especially in the case of online platforms, antitrust laws should take into consideration the underlying structures and dynamics of markets. </p><p>Ms Khan writes that Amazon has established its dominance through two elements of its business strategy: integration across business lines and a willingness to lose money and invest aggressively. Both elements are aptly demonstrated by the $13-a-month Amazon Prime service, which offers customers free next-day delivery and access to the company's expanding content library. In 2011 it was estimated that each Prime member cost Amazon at least $90 (\u00a369.50) a year in lost shipping and film revenue, meaning the company lost $11 per customer annually. But Prime is considered crucial to Amazon's growth as an online retailer and it is estimated that customers increase their purchases from Amazon by around 150 per cent after they become Prime members. They also become more likely to buy from Amazon rather than other platforms. In this way, Amazon's strategy allowed it to use predatory pricing methods without drawing the attention of pricing laws. </p><p>The paper also identifies vertical integration as a way in which Amazon has established its market dominance. Vertical integration occurs when multiple successive stages of production or distribution of a product are brought under the same company. Take Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA), a service that gives online vendors access to Amazon's logistics system in exchange for a fee. Sellers who use FBA have an improved chance of being listed higher in Amazon search results than those who do not. This means that Amazon connects the success of the vendors that use its retail website to whether they also use its delivery system.</p><p>Comparable dynamics can also be found in Amazon's online infrastructure. As its Marketplace holds a large proportion of e-commerce traffic, many smaller merchants find that it is necessary to use the site in order to attract buyers. But Ms Khan cites evidence that Amazon uses its Marketplace as a testing ground to spot new products to sell itself. Using sales data from merchants in this way allows the company to bolster its own retail revenues without taking on extra risk. If products do well, Amazon sells them in-house but undercuts the pricing of existing vendors. </p><p>The problem facing regulators is that the current antitrust laws in the US or Europe don't deal with vertical integration, e-commerce platforms or predatory pricing. Ms Khan therefore proposes two approaches for addressing the dominance of Amazon and its peers: strengthen the law against predatory pricing and police forms of vertical integration that companies can use for anticompetitive practices. </p><p>She notes that while predatory pricing is technically illegal, it is hard to win claims because courts require evidence that the apparent predator would be able to raise prices as well as regain its losses. On the other hand, a competition-based approach could introduce the 'presumption of predation' - that is, courts could operate on the basis that an aggressive pricing strategy was being undertaken by dominant platforms that have already been found to be pricing products below cost.</p><p>The second proposal is that regulators should include a company's capacity to cross-leverage data in merger review. At the time of the paper's publication, only mergers of a particular size required agency review - but in Ms Khan's view this may not be a true indicator of the scale of data at risk. If this had been the case, Facebook's (US:FB) purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram may have received greater scrutiny from antitrust agencies. </p><p>Ms Khan concludes that current law does not fully appreciate the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines can affect competition. This is perhaps most apparent in the context of online platforms such as Amazon - in part because platform markets often drive growth over profits, a strategy that investors have historically rewarded. </p><p>Further reading:</p><p>'<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">Amazon's Antitrust Paradox</url>', Lina M.

With revenge porn and online bullying much in the news, the report's focus was broadly on harmful communications and internet safety for adults, as well as children.</p><h>Demands </h><p>The Irish role could be modelled on positions created in New Zealand and Australia, says Naughten. Australia's eSafety Commissioner, appointed in 2015, investigates complaints and can fine online operators up to AUS$17,000 (EUR 11,000) a day for failing to comply with its demands.  </p><p>At the time, the Australian position was vociferously opposed by internet companies, which expressed alarm that a single person effectively could act as an online content censor, judge and jury. </p><p>The Irish role would have sweeping oversight, \"broadly to cover intermediary service providers, internet service providers, internet intermediaries, online intermediaries, online service providers, search engines, social media platforms and websites and telecommunications undertakings\", notes Daniel Harrington, a lawyer with A&amp;L Goodbody.</p><p>With the ability to judge content and issue and enforce content-takedown notices to internet and telecommunications firms, the commissioner could come into conflict with the EU ecommerce directive, notes Harrington. Other legal experts said the position might also run foul of incoming ePrivacy legislation, or overlap into the Irish Data Protection Commissioner's role. </p><p>But is such an office actually needed, or merely a political ploy to gain voter support?</p><p>Certainly, little has been done since the office was initially proposed 18 months ago. And some formal submissions to the Law Reform Commission argued at the time that a specialist body with statutory powers was not needed, because existing laws and the courts could and should handle such cases.</p><h>Resolution </h><p>In a submission, Digital Rights Ireland (DRI) wrote that \"cyber-harassment and other harmful cyber activity affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation do not require, for their resolution, any specialist technical expertise. These are offences against the safety, privacy and reputation of the individual, as capable of being carried out online as off. Accordingly, the only appropriate expert body to adjudicate such claims is a court of law.\"  </p><p>Both the DRI submission in 2016, and Harrington in his blog post this week, also question whether Ireland's reputation as a good location for business might suffer, were a new layer of Irish internet and communications regulation to be imposed. </p><p>Yet internet and technology companies must certainly do better. A London School of Economics professor, working with a board member for the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, last year found Instagram's age controls to be close to meaningless.</p><p>Companies are aware of growing public opprobrium, and many aim to improve services. Microsoft, which owns message and telephony service Skype, said the companies have worked towards better online safety.</p><p>Would a digital safety commissioner accelerate improvements and set a rigorous example of enforcement, though? The Australian office, the eSafety Commissioner, received nearly 12,000 complaints in its first year - but hadn't fined anybody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3370994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH5-H361-DYS1-00SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 27, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0004L11</classCode><className>A &amp;

It's not a hunch. It's a fact.\"<br/>Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument: \"If Facebook is trying to suppress conservative discourse, they're doing a lousy job. I don't understand this endless whining of Republicans.<br/>Trump, who accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his comments and going against the conservatives, intervened with a tweet shortly before the start of the hearing.<br/>\"If Congress doesn't do justice to Big Tech, what they should have done years ago, I'll do it myself with executive orders,\" he said. \"In Washington, it's been ALL TALK AND NOT ACTING for years, and the people of our country are fed up and tired!\" he added.<br/>Zuckerberg and Pichai rejected accusations that their platforms leak conservative opinions.<br/>\"Our goal is to provide a platform for all ideas,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We want to give everyone a voice.\"<br/>\"We approach our work in a non-partisan way,\" Pichai said. \"We will continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral manner.\"<br/>- Monopolies? -<br/>Democrat Pramila Jayapal, from Washington state, said Google \"manages the market\" of advertising, \"because it acts on the buy-side and on the sale side, which is a big conflict of interest.\"<br/>Meanwhile, Tim Cook faced harsh questions about the market power of Apple's App Store and its treatment of developers. \"We treat all app developers the same way,\" Cook said. \"We don't retaliate or intimidate people.\"<br/>Some lawmakers sought to tone down criticism of internet titans, who have also been praised for their innovation and introduction of new technologies.<br/>Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner argued that \"being great is not necessarily bad.\"<br/>\"On the contrary, in America one should be rewarded for success,\" he addedWisconsin lawmaker.<br/>Bezos, in his first appearance before a Congressional panel, defended Amazon's attitude with outside vendors, after being subjected to harsh attacks by Cicilline.<br/>\"Isn't it true that small businesses have no choice but to turn to Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales?\" asked the committee chair.<br/>\"We've heard time and again from third-party vendors pointing out in the course of our research that Amazon is the only possibility,\" he added.<br/>Bezos rejected the statement and noted: \"There are many options for small businesses. I think we're the best.\"<br/>U.S. antitrust laws make it difficult for regulators to act against companies simply because they are large or dominant if they cannot prove that they harm consumers or abuse their market power.<br/>However, some analysts felt that the hearing could lay the groundwork for reviewing antitrust laws.<br/>\"There was considerable skepticism towards the tech sector, \" by lawmakers, said Darrell West, director of the Technology Innovation Center at the Brookings Institution.<br/>Michael Carrier, a professor of antitrust law at Rutgers University, considered that \"the audience showed that representatives did their homework,\" and while he said he did not believe it would cause \"immediate changes,\" it will give a \"continuous drive to challenge these companies.\"<br/>rl/jm/piz/ll/yow/mls/gma<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13541826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-C6Y1-DY1R-B0JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Tim Cook, de Apple; Jeff Bezos, de Amazon; Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai testify remotely before the House Judicial Subcommittee investigating whether their signatures violate antitrust laws.\" In short, they have too much power,\" the house antitrust commission holder David Cicilline said in his opening remarks of the virtual audience with the CEOs of the four American tech giants.\" That power avoids new forms of competition, creativity, and innovation,\" the Rhode Island Democratic representative added. </p><p>\"The dominant platforms have exercised their power in a destructive and detrimental way to expand.\" Before the covid-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,\" he said. \"However, as a result of covid-19, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.\" The unprecedented joint hearing before the House Judicial Subcommittee is amid growing concern about the dominance of \"Big Tech\" and is part of an antitrust investigation.          Other topics - However, questions are expected to shift to other topics, such as hate speech, content moderation, economic inequality, privacy and data protection, and even President Donald Trump's often virulent comments on the networks.\" I'm just going to get to the point: great technology haunts conservatives,\" said Jim Jordan, Ohio's Republican Congressman. \"It's not a suspicion. It's not a hunch. It's a fact.\" Republican Gregory Steube of Florida questioned Google's removal of a video promoting covid-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine, stating that this \"silences the opinion of doctors.\" Trump, who accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his comments and being biased against the conservatives, intervened with a tweet shortly before the start of the hearing.\" If Congress does justice to big tech, what they should have done years ago, I'll do it myself with executive orders,\" he said. \"In Washington, it's been ALL TALK AND NOT TO HAVE TRIGGERED for years, and the people of our country are fed up and tired!\" Zuckerberg and Pichai rejected accusations that their platforms leak conservative opinions.\" Our goal is to provide a platform for all ideas,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We want to give everyone a voice.\"\" We approach our work in a non-partisan way,\" Pichai said. \"We will continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral manner.\"          - Monopolies? Meanwhile, Tim Cook faced harsh questions about the market power of Apple's App Store and its treatment of developers. \"We treat all app developers the same way,\" Cook said. \"We don't retaliate or intimidate people.\" Some lawmakers sought to tone down criticism of internet titans, who have also been praised for their innovation and introduction of new technologies. Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner argued that \"being big is not necessarily bad.\" On the contrary, in the United States one should be rewarded for success,\" the Wisconsin lawmaker added.Bezos, in his first appearance before a Panel of Congress, defended Amazon's handling of outside vendors, after being the subject ofCicilline's tough attacks.\" Isn't it true that small businesses have no choice but to turn to Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales?\" the committee chairman asked.\" We have heard time and again from third-party vendors pointing out in the course of our research that Amazon is the only possibility,\" he added. Bezos rejected the statement and noted: \"There are many options for small businesses. I think we're the best.\" In comments prepared before the hearing, Bezos recalled his humble origins as well as the loss of billions of dollars in Amazon's early years.\" I went from a steady job to a garage in Seattle to start my startup, fully understanding that it might not work,\" said Bezos, the richest man in the world. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg called Facebook a \"proudly American company\" adding that the social media colossus story \"would not have been possible without U.S. laws encouraging competition and innovation.\" Cook described Apple as \"an exclusively American company whose success is only possible\" in that country, whose mission is to \"provide things that enrich people's lives.\" U.S. antitrust laws make it difficult for regulators to act against companies simply because they are large or dominant if they cannot prove that they harm consumers or abuse their market power. The judicial subcommittee could, however, establish an antitrust model for the digital age that requires a fundamental rewrite of the centuries-old laws governing competition.rl/jm/piz/ll/yow/mls -------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13541836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-C6Y1-DY1R-B0K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It's not a hunch. It's a fact.\"<br/>Republican Gregory Steube of Florida questioned Google's removal of a video promoting covid-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine, stating that this \"silences the opinion of doctors.\"<br/>Trump, who accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his comments and being biased against the Conservatives, intervened with a tweet shortly before the start of the hearing.<br/>\"If Congress does justice to big tech, what they should have done years ago, I'll do it myself with executive orders,\" he said. \"In Washington, it's been ALL TALK AND NOT TO HAVE TRIGGERED for years, and the people of our country are fed up and tired!\"<br/>Zuckerberg and Pichai rejected accusations that their platforms leak conservative opinions.<br/>\"Our goal is to provide a platform for all ideas,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We want to give everyone a voice.\"<br/>\"We approach our work in a non-partisan way,\" Pichai said. \"We will continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral manner.\"<br/>- Monopolies? -<br/>Meanwhile, Tim Cook faced harsh questions about the market power of Apple's App Store and its treatment of developers. \"We treat all app developers the same way,\" Cook said. \"We don't retaliate or intimidate people.\"<br/>Some lawmakers sought to tone down criticism of internet titans, who have also been praised for their innovation and introduction of new technologies.<br/>Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner argued that \"being great is not necessarily bad.\"<br/>\"On the contrary, in the United States one should be rewarded for success,\" the Wisconsin legislator added.<br/>Bezos, in his first appearance before a Congressional Panel, defended Amazon's handling of outside vendors, after beingCicilline's harsh attacks.<br/>\"Isn't it true that small businesses have no choice but to turn to Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales?\" asked the committee chair.<br/>\"We've heard time and again from third-party vendors pointing out in the course of our research that Amazon is the only possibility,\" he added.<br/>Bezos rejected the statement and noted: \"There are many options for small businesses. I think we're the best.\"<br/>In comments prepared before the hearing, Bezos recalled his humble origins as well as the loss of billions of dollars in Amazon's early years.<br/>\"I went from a steady job to a garage in Seattle to start my startup, fully understanding that it might not work,\" said Bezos, the richest man in the world.<br/>Meanwhile, Zuckerberg called Facebook a \"proudly American company\" adding that the social media colossus story \"would not have been possible without U.S. laws encouraging competition and innovation.\"<br/>Cook described Apple as \"an exclusively American company whose success is only possible\" in that country, whose mission is to \"provide things that enrich people's lives.\"<br/>U.S. antitrust laws make it difficult for regulators to act against companies simply because they are large or dominant if they cannot prove that they harm consumers or abuse their market power.<br/>The judicial subcommittee could, however, establish an antitrust model for the digital age that requires a fundamental rewrite of the centuries-old laws governing competition.<br/>rl/jm/piz/ll/yow/mls<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13538407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-D161-DY1R-B1TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Once idolised as the hub of innovation and start-up culture that would disrupt the world's biggest profiteers and make life better for all, Big Tech is now accused of radicalising and exploiting the masses. Experts say the outsized power and control it commands will be a major issue in the next U.S. election cycle. Even now, regulation looms, but many feel that politicians are hopelessly underprepared to tackle the tech industry's ascendancy and its impact on economy, society and democratic hegemony. Moreover, wealth matters. Silicon Valley's tech conglomerates have propelled California's GDP to $2.46 trillion, a shade lower than India's 2017 GDP of $2.6 trillion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The growing clout of Big Tech may cause even more damage. As new-age start-ups are keen to emulate the success of these poster boys - at any cost - massive start-up frauds and unsavoury founders are no longer rare in the Valley, or elsewhere. From Theranos to Autonomy to Asenqua Ventures, there are many cautionary tales.</p><p>As the big picture starts looking somewhat murky, two recent books - Silicon States (by Lucie Greene) and The Big Nine (by Amy Webb) - have analysed the problems of Big Tech even though right fixes are difficult to come by. Both writers boast a 'futurist' tag (Greene describes futurism as part social science, part journalism and part scenario planning) and display a noon-clear understanding of what has broken down and what the future holds.</p><p>The Silicon States dives deep to chronicle how the league of Big Tech (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Tesla, Snapchat and others) are trying to shape our future. Of course, not all of them hail from the Valley, but Greene categorises these and many others as Silicon Valley companies as all of them thrive on new-age innovations and a culture of excellence which distinguishes the Valley firms. They have power and influence, and the outcome of their widely varied operations has a chilling similarity.</p><p>When fast-food workers, airline ticketing staff and thousands of others are made redundant by automation, the devastating lifestyle change for the significant swathe of population is usually rationalised as 'progress' or 'logical efficiencies' by Valley billionaires. But it is not about jobs alone. \"They are vying for our healthcare, infrastructure, energy, space travel, education and postal systems. And they are applying the tools that won them success - platforms, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer-centric on-demand models - to disrupt them,\" points out Greene.</p><p>The first chapter of the book traces the evolution of the Valley - the transformation from a small hub housing a handful of chipmakers in the 1970s to a global concept that goes beyond any specific sector or industry. It is a state of mind, an innovation culture, which embodies a new power map. The author then goes on to make a convincing case that Big Tech has started to influence political discourse, governments and governance. She details the impact of fake news, social media avatars and bots, and their ability to shape and distort the digital sphere, underlining how the Valley is grabbing power and governments are getting weaker. The book also devotes an entire chapter on how the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google have become more powerful than the traditional media. Calling them the Fifth Estate, Greene explains how these companies have evolved into mediators, curators, primary channels and increasingly, generators of news.</p><p>For those who remember Facebook's attempt to offer free but limited-access Internet services in India but cannot understand why it was opposed by many, the chapter titled Connecting the World provides an answer. Apparently, behind the Big Tech's plan to gift an Internet infrastructure lies a bigger objective to access a fresh market. But such motives appear minuscule compared to its aspiration to transform human life and the universe as we know it. As its expertise expands - from material science, engineering and medicine to robotics, machine learning, genetics and beyond - a fearsome evolution could take place .</p><p>\"They are all intersecting in new ways to create new, daring products. Often these are in such uncharted territory, or moving so quickly, that the potential ethical quandaries are an afterthought or not yet understood from a regulatory point of view,\" the author cautions. She also looks into Big Tech's ubiquitous diversity problems, tax issues and figures out why its massive philanthropic initiatives have a disproportionate impact on government policies.</p><p>Written in three parts, Amy Webb's The Big Nine is not so broad in scope but sharply focusses on one technical tool used by most tech conglomerates nowadays - the artificial intelligence (AI). As the title suggests, Webb has written about nine tech giants - Google, Amazon, Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Facebook in the US and Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent in China - all of whom are on the forefront of AI usage.</p><p>In the beginning, the book talks about AI and the role of the nine tech giants in its development. The middle section provides detailed, plausible futures over the next 50 years as the technology advances, ranging from optimistic to pragmatic to catastrophic. It reveals both opportunities and risks as we advance from artificial narrow intelligence to artificial general intelligence to artificial superintelligence. The concluding part features tactical and strategic solutions to all problems identified in each scenario, along with a concrete plant to reboot the present.</p><p>Interestingly, you will find recom-mendations for governments, Big Nine leaders and even readers as Webb believes the future of AI is currently moving along two developmental tracks which are often at odds with what is best for humanity. \"China's AI push is part of a co-ordinated attempt to create a new world order led by President Xi, while market forces and consumerism are the primary drivers in America. This dichotomy is a serious blind spot for us all.\"</p><p>The big question remains, though - how to curb the controlling power of tech monopolies without hurting their power of innovation. The world seems ready to pull the emergency brake in the form of ham-handed government interventions, but that may snuff out the very spirit of Silicon Valley and the values it originally stood for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LIVMIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTOD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-P471-DYX3-50N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163808</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1068\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Living Media India Ltd.

Incumbent banks can learn from and acquire Fintechs to enhance existing offerings, provide new services, address customer needs and improve operational efficiency. All financial institutions will need to evolve \u2013 incumbents, digital banks and neo banks.\" \u2026\u2026\u2026 Acxiom</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nobody will disagree that the banking industry is going through massive changes unlike anything seen in decades. New technologies are impacting legacy banking models and consumer expectations, as well as the competitors in the marketplace. We are even seeing changes in the way financial institutions engage with consumers across their financial lifecycle. The question is, what are the most important trends that we will need to take action on in the next 12-18 months? More importantly, what action is needed? As banking grows more complex, it is becoming more difficult to deliver seamless customer experiences and consistency across channels. Banks are responding by using advanced digital technologies and new business models to build better customer experiences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transformation in banking will continue beyond 2020, but building competencies that can take advantage of these trends needs to begin now. Here are six (6) of the most important trends that can be expected in 2020 as outlined by Jim Marous and the Financial Brand in a research:</p><p>The battle between Cyberthreats and Cybersecurity</p><p>Organizations and the public at large are increasingly aware of the threat of cybercrimes and the importance of cybersecurity. That said, most organizations are struggling to keep up with the risk of cyberthreats. From data breaches and IT security staff shortages to security automation and integration cybersecurity will remain a top technology trend in banking. Ensuring data privacy, and the security of personal data, continues to be a challenge as data breaches continue daily.</p><p>The challenge is exacerbated because of the cybersecurity skills gap. In fact, as many as two in three organizations worldwide reported a shortage of IT security staff. While automation of some functions can relieve some of the pressure, web applications combining multiple web services are increasingly hard to secure. On top of the traditional threats, the increase in mobile devices, internet of things (IoT) devices and the continued threat of state-sponsored attacks only adds to the challenge.</p><p>An Age of Collaboration</p><p>With change in the banking industry happening so quickly, it is impossible for any organization, of any size to \"go it alone.\" The value of establishing the right strategic partnerships has never been greater. \"Partnering can extend products and platforms into new markets, expose brands to new customer segments and create scale,\" Acxiom observes. The ultimate objective is to improve the customer experience with an enhanced value transfer. When the right strategic partners are selected, there should be greater agility, a seamless integration with systems and products already in place, and a synergy not possible previously. There also needs to be a flexibility within the partnership that will allow the collaboration to adjust to marketplace changes without needing to renegotiate the relationship.</p><p>Going forward, partnerships will extend beyond traditional providers to include fintech firms, big tech organizations, communities and potentially even governmental units. In some instances, solution providers will partner with each other to enable a better integration within banks and credit unions with less internal and external friction.</p><p>Done well, these bilateral and multilateral networks of providers will be able to deliver more personalized solutions than was possible previously. Imagine 8-10 different savings or lending solutions being available for different segments the retail consumer or business population. These solutions will increase engagement as well as value to the consumer (and financial institution). This will be accomplished by leveraging new data assets, advanced analytics, and modern communication platforms.</p><p>An Age of Enhanced Data Utilization </p><p>With enhanced sources of data and technology to process insights, there is an unparalleled opportunity to proactively identify consumer needs and the appropriate product or service to be offered. Beyond using a simple demographic, product ownership and risk-based profile, banks can deliver greatly improved results by combining both traditional and non-traditional data.</p><p>Today, financial marketers and product managers have access to lifestyle and psychographic data, financial and non-financial product ownership and purchase data, channel preference insights, brand loyalties, geo-location data and even insights from social media use. These enhanced insights, when combined with advanced analytics will not only provide purchase propensity information, but also the projected timing of need.</p><p>The result is highly personalized communication that the consumer will welcome delivered to the device or platform the consumer prefers. Done well, this also can increase the prospect market beyond what was possible before, reaching previously underserved consumers who may only have a \"thin file\" with less data available.</p><p>An Age of the Non-Traditional Player</p><p>What legacy financial institutions have in capital, customers and infrastructure, they often lack in speed, innovation and a genuine focus on the consumer. This is why more and more fintech firms have not only entered the banking ecosystem, but have succeeded in moving market share. The payments ecosystem will never be the same, and the lending battlefield is getting more and more crowded with new players filling the needs of an increasingly diverse consumer.</p><p>Fintech firms compete by serving the consumer without being tied to a legacy of operations and organizational rules and structure. This allows them to provide products and services that are faster, easier, and/or cheaper than what traditional banks can deliver. According to Acxiom, \"The movement toward open banking and open APIs will only increase the speed of change as fintech business models and technologies allow them to align with new opportunities very quickly.\" The consumer wants speed, simplicity, intuitive design and the ability to complete a task with a simple push of a button. Legacy financial institutions struggle to provide that level of user experience. Beyond smaller fintech organizations, big tech firms are now leveraging their platforms to combine shopping, ride-sharing, searching and engaging with new distribution options for traditional financial services.</p><p>While there has always been the benefit of trust on the side of legacy financial institutions, big tech firms as well as smaller fintech firms that have been in existence for more than a few years are receiving trust scores approaching and even surpassing legacy banks and credit unions. This should be a cause for concern especially for mid-tier and smaller financial institutions in the foreseeable future.</p><p>An Age of Advanced Marketing Performance</p><p>Data, advanced analytics and the deployment of new marketing technologies make it possible to target and specific audience at the proper time of engagement better than ever in the past. And, at a time when fewer consumers are switching providers, effective multichannel marketing is needed to stimulate new customer and organic growth.</p><p>The challenge is that the ability to measure the effectiveness of increasing investments in marketing has lagged. With most organizations using multichannel marketing campaigns, it is more important than ever to measure the effectiveness of each channel in the customer journey and to understand the best cadence and sequence of messages for the optimal ROI.</p><p>In the end, last-touch attribution is no longer an acceptable measure. Instead, it is imperative to understand the interrelationships of channels and messages to apply spending to the key moments of a customer purchase journey</p><p>An Age of the Platform Economy</p><p>\"A platform is a plug-and-play business model that allows multiple participants (producers and consumers) to connect to it, interact with each other and create and exchange value,\" according to Acxiom, While the retail industry has the greatest number of organizations with platforms (50), the financial services industry has 26 platforms organizations, according to a KPMG analysis.</p><p>A true platform would offer products and services from multiple organizations to serve the needs of a broader array of consumers. Most financial institutions have not come close to offering a platform solution. This could definitely be a problem in the future.</p><p>As we approach 2020, it is clear that we can't stop change or the impact it is having on banking, the consumer and even regulators. Today's consumer expectation is different from the past, and they will continue to change in the future. As consumer expectations change, so must the financial institutions that serve them. If traditional organizations don't meet the needs, fintech or big tech firms will.</p><p>Notes:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/90562/digital-banking-transformation-platform-fintech-data-marketing-trends/\">https://thefinancialbrand.com/90562/digital-banking-transformation-platform-fintech-data-marketing-trends/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/90968/banking-technology-5g-ai-blockchain-cloud-voice-cx-cybersecurit-trends-2020/\">https://thefinancialbrand.com/90968/banking-technology-5g-ai-blockchain-cloud-voice-cx-cybersecurit-trends-2020/</url></p><p>About the Writer:</p><p>Ebenezer ASUMANG (CGIA) has worked in mainstream Banking, Savings &amp; Loans, and the Microfinance institutions.

They will be tethered goats in a clearing. The final report of the banking royal commission will still be hanging in the air like the scent of fear, along with the (Labor?) government's response to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not that the final report could be much worse than what's coming out now, you'd think, including this headline in The Australian on Wednesday: \"NAB charged dead customers\".</p><p>Dear, oh dear. Was that the low water mark? They hope.</p><p>This week, hapless NAB executives were cooked on the royal commission rotisserie over a fire of $34 million in fees that had to be given back to 220,000 customers because nothing had been done for the money. Some of those customers had shuffled off this mortal coil and ceased to be in need of NAB's services. CBA had been doing the same thing, as well as helping mobsters with their money-laundering problems. NAB had misled ASIC as well. So had AMP.</p><p>And we learnt this week from CBA's annual report that its executives had lost some $100 million in bonuses. A hundred million bucks? You mean they would have got that much if they hadn't been bad?</p><p>So next year, the banks will have to start handing over customers' data and making it available to competitors, on request, including through application program inter-faces (APIs) that will make it super easy for those customers to be spirited away. APIs will allow competitors to offer specific, narrow banking services and cherry-pick the most profitable bits of the banks.</p><p>Who will take advantage of the \"open banking\" regime and compete with them? For an answer, I spoke to David Duffy, CEO of CYBG, the British bank that is dual listed on the ASX and the London Stock Exchange, having been hived out of NAB two years ago (the C stands for Clydesdale and the Y for Yorkshire, the two prongs of NAB's ill-fated attempt to bestow its vast banking expertise on the rest of the world).</p><p>Britain has had open banking for a few months, and Duffy's sixth-ranked bank is now using it to vigorously attack the five above him. As part of that, CYBG is in the process of buying Virgin Money to be used as the brand for its digital bank.</p><p>But he said that most of all, the British banks, including his own, are preparing for a siege against new competitors, from outside their ranks.</p><p>Who from? Amazon, that's who.</p><p>Duffy told me: \"What I'm -focused on is the Amazons of the world who are talking to banks and talking to regulators about becoming part of the banking system in some way.</p><p>\"They've yet to make that a very specific move, but the dialogue between an Amazon or an equivalent large tech firm is very significant and I think what you're looking at is a big tech entrance to the marketplace over time and that could have dramatic consequences in terms of the infrastructure activity of banks versus the cost to provide the same by those tech firms.\" Duffy believes open banking in Britain and Europe is producing an inflection point for the industry.</p><p>\"I think what you should be looking at in terms of an inflection point is the combination of an open banking environment and the threat of large tech companies, disintermediating banking services, either in the payments industry aspect of the banks or in other parts of the service model or in parts of the scaled infrastructure. Those forces coming together over the next five years is where I think you're seeing a fundamental shift in how banking is provided to the customer versus the past.\" In Australia, of course, there is another force of nature, in the person of royal commissioner Ken Hayne, and the orgy of customer neglect, and worse, that he has brought forth.</p><p>The combination of open banking in Australia and the royal commission is one of those freakish coincidences that defines history.</p><p>The process of bringing -Europe-style open banking to this country was kicked off by Scott Morrison on July 20 last year when he commissioned an Open Banking Review from a panel chaired by Scott Farrell, a partner of law firm King &amp; Wood -Mallesons.</p><p>Ironically, it was part of the Treasurer's defence against the ALP's calls for banking royal commission: the Turnbull government, he said, was reforming the system and doing the things that would come of a royal commission anyway. But that was before CBA was done for thousands of breaches of money laundering laws, which was the final straw.</p><p>Morrison and -Malcolm Turnbull threw in the towel on November 20 and announced a royal commission.</p><p>Scott Farrell, meanwhile, produced his report in December.</p><p>There followed a period of consultation and no one with whom he consulted thought it was a bad idea, although the response of the banks and the Australian Banking Association could best be characterised as: \"Yes, but\".</p><p>In fact, the ABA submission might have been written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the writers of Yes Minister of blessed memory (Jay died in 2016; Lynn is 75 and lives in Bath).</p><p>Morrison produced his response to the Farrell Review on May 9 this year and it didn't get a lot of attention, coming, as it did, during one of the royal commission's public hearing hunting seasons.</p><p>The April hearings into -financial advice had been spectacular, and everybody was still reeling.</p><p>Cornered, Morrison revealed a 12-month phase-in period, saying: \"Open Banking will also allow entrepreneurs to develop new services and products tailored to customers' needs, disrupting those existing business models within the banking sector that do not put customers first.\" That would be all of them, I -believe.Alan Kohler is publisher of The Constant Investor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-be617c129c2f11e880b5bc3035a56c595750f5ce97602efdacb8daeabf69d710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0S-XY71-F0JP-W38W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 11, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001V19</classCode><className>NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DL8H</classCode><className>CYBG PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0006Q3X</classCode><className>VIRGIN MONEY PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAB (ASX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>CYBG (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>CYB (ASX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

They will be tethered goats in a clearing. The final report of the banking royal commission will still be hanging in the air like the scent of fear, along with the (Labor?) government's response to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not that the final report could be much worse than what's coming out now, you'd think, including this headline in The Australian on Wednesday: \"NAB charged dead customers\".</p><p>Dear, oh dear. Was that the low water mark? They hope.</p><p>This week, hapless NAB executives were cooked on the royal commission rotisserie over a fire of $34 million in fees that had to be given back to 220,000 customers because nothing had been done for the money. Some of those customers had shuffled off this mortal coil and ceased to be in need of NAB's services. CBA had been doing the same thing, as well as helping mobsters with their money-laundering problems. NAB had misled ASIC as well. So had AMP.</p><p>And we learnt this week from CBA's annual report that its executives had lost some $100 million in bonuses. A hundred million bucks? You mean they would have got that much if they hadn't been bad?</p><p>So next year, the banks will have to start handing over customers' data and making it available to competitors, on request, including through application program inter-faces (APIs) that will make it super easy for those customers to be spirited away. APIs will allow competitors to offer specific, narrow banking services and cherry-pick the most profitable bits of the banks.</p><p>Who will take advantage of the \"open banking\" regime and compete with them? For an answer, I spoke to David Duffy, CEO of CYBG, the British bank that is dual listed on the ASX and the London Stock Exchange, having been hived out of NAB two years ago (the C stands for Clydesdale and the Y for Yorkshire, the two prongs of NAB's ill-fated attempt to bestow its vast banking expertise on the rest of the world).</p><p>Britain has had open banking for a few months, and Duffy's sixth-ranked bank is now using it to vigorously attack the five above him. As part of that, CYBG is in the process of buying Virgin Money to be used as the brand for its digital bank.</p><p>But he said that most of all, the British banks, including his own, are preparing for a siege against new competitors, from outside their ranks.</p><p>Who from? Amazon, that's who.</p><p>Duffy told me: \"What I'm -focused on is the Amazons of the world who are talking to banks and talking to regulators about becoming part of the banking system in some way.</p><p>\"They've yet to make that a very specific move, but the dialogue between an Amazon or an equivalent large tech firm is very significant and I think what you're looking at is a big tech entrance to the marketplace over time and that could have dramatic consequences in terms of the infrastructure activity of banks versus the cost to provide the same by those tech firms.\" Duffy believes open banking in Britain and Europe is producing an inflection point for the industry.</p><p>\"I think what you should be looking at in terms of an inflection point is the combination of an open banking environment and the threat of large tech companies, disintermediating banking services, either in the payments industry aspect of the banks or in other parts of the service model or in parts of the scaled infrastructure. Those forces coming together over the next five years is where I think you're seeing a fundamental shift in how banking is provided to the customer versus the past.\" In Australia, of course, there is another force of nature, in the person of royal commissioner Ken Hayne, and the orgy of customer neglect, and worse, that he has brought forth.</p><p>The combination of open banking in Australia and the royal commission is one of those freakish coincidences that defines history.</p><p>The process of bringing -Europe-style open banking to this country was kicked off by Scott Morrison on July 20 last year when he commissioned an Open Banking Review from a panel chaired by Scott Farrell, a partner of law firm King &amp; Wood -Mallesons.</p><p>Ironically, it was part of the Treasurer's defence against the ALP's calls for banking royal commission: the Turnbull government, he said, was reforming the system and doing the things that would come of a royal commission anyway. But that was before CBA was done for thousands of breaches of money laundering laws, which was the final straw.</p><p>Morrison and -Malcolm Turnbull threw in the towel on November 20 and announced a royal commission.</p><p>Scott Farrell, meanwhile, produced his report in December.</p><p>There followed a period of consultation and no one with whom he consulted thought it was a bad idea, although the response of the banks and the Australian Banking Association could best be characterised as: \"Yes, but\".</p><p>In fact, the ABA submission might have been written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the writers of Yes Minister of blessed memory (Jay died in 2016; Lynn is 75 and lives in Bath).</p><p>Morrison produced his response to the Farrell Review on May 9 this year and it didn't get a lot of attention, coming, as it did, during one of the royal commission's public hearing hunting seasons.</p><p>The April hearings into -financial advice had been spectacular, and everybody was still reeling.</p><p>Cornered, Morrison revealed a 12-month phase-in period, saying: \"Open Banking will also allow entrepreneurs to develop new services and products tailored to customers' needs, disrupting those existing business models within the banking sector that do not put customers first.\" That would be all of them, I -believe.Alan Kohler is publisher of The Constant Investor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-be617c129c2f11e880b5bc3035a56c59ff4b9e197872e65f2fce07bedae1b2a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T16-W611-F0JP-W1WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 11, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001V19</classCode><className>NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DL8H</classCode><className>CYBG PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0006Q3X</classCode><className>VIRGIN MONEY PERSONAL FINANCIAL SERVICE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAB (ASX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>CYBG (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>CYB (ASX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

This task was given to Dame Frances Cairncross, below, a former editor for The Economist and columnist for The Guardian. This week she produced her report. It featured some sensible recommendations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are likely to see a further decline in the size of the UK's news publishing sector - in journalists and in titles,\" she said. \"Ultimately, the biggest challenge facing the sustainability of high-quality journalism and the press may be the same as that which is affecting every area of life: the digital revolution means that people have more claims on their attention than ever before.</p><p>Moreover, the stories people want to read may not always be the ones that they ought to read in order to ensure that a democracy can hold its public servants properly to account.\" So what suggestions did she have to offer? Some related to financial supports like lowering Vat on digital news subscriptions to bring online paywalls into line with printed newspapers, tax relief for publishers that invest in public interest journalism, and even potentially giving charitable status to some publishers. The report also recommends the creation of a fund focused on innovations to improve the supply of public-interest news and a new Institute for Public Interest News, which would distribute funding and work with publishers on sustainable public-interest news.</p><p>Then there's big tech. Dame Cairncross calls for the UK competition regulator to investigate whether the dominance of Facebook and Google is detrimental to public interest news sources.</p><p>She also favours a new regulated code of conduct between publishers and large tech companies. But the report doesn't make the tech industry out to be the bad guys. Cairncross rejects any suggestion that Facebook and Google should be made to pay publishers to host news content, warning that this could limit the spread of news to those who want to see it.</p><p>Publishers catch some of the flak for their own downfall in the Cairncross Review. It points out that many newspaper groups in the UK have failed to invest in the infrastructure and innovations needed to forge a successful digital future, instead they've focused on making cuts or restructuring their debt.</p><p>The UK isn't the only country where such an interrogation of the issues facing the news industry has taken place. In the US the Knight Commission on Trust, Media, and Democracy recently issued a hefty 200-plus page report. It's not government backed, and as a result lacks the policy-punch that the Cairncross review delivers. But it does cover many similar bases - how to restore trust in journalism and revitalise publishing.</p><p>The overarching recommendation is that news organisations need to be radically transparent and interwoven with the communities they cover. This means prioritising reporting and evidence-based commentary over opinion, implementing best practices around corrections and fact-checking, and engaging with communities to improve the relevance of reporting and increase trust.</p><p>The Knight Commission report homes in on the growth of non-profit news outlets. \"As profit-driven newspapers continue their economic decline, the Commission recommends accelerated investment in non-profit, mission-driven journalistic entities we call Community News Organisations\", it says.</p><p>Like the Cairncross review, the Knight Commission report also has a section on technology. News companies need to embrace technology to support their mission and achieve sustainability it says. And it rightly points out that there is an inequality of resources in relation to news organisations and technology.</p><p>The New York Times and the Washington Post can afford data journalists, AI experts, engineers and app developers, but many local news entities struggle to keep the lights on.</p><p>Given the travails of the news industry in the developed world, the growth of the internet as a advertising powerhouse and as a vector for the spread of misinformation, plus the threatened extinction of local media outlets, it's vital that the points raised by the likes of the Cairncross Review and the Knight Commission are discussed by policymakers and civil society. The news media itself can't be a passenger, here. It must engage with the valid criticisms in such research and do better than waiting for government handouts, because Facebook and Google came along and threatened its business model.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-146559026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFG-GHJ1-DYTY-C4SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 17, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

With some 12 million viewers per game last year, the NCAA tournament exemplifies the marquee programming the U.S. government argues will become more expensive if Time Warner is bought by AT&amp;T, the biggest pay-TV provider via subsidiary DirecTV. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&amp;T, which has some 25 million pay-TV subscribers, from closing the US$85 billion deal. AT&amp;T says a merger benefits consumers by creating efficiencies. If the government loses, that could open up the field for similar tie-ups between distributors and content providers. </p><p>But a win could strengthen the hand of antitrust regulators looking at other, similarly structured mergers. Opening arguments in the case are set for Thursday before Judge Richard Leon in Washington, who will decide the case. They were delayed one day by bad weather. The merger would hand AT&amp;T, if it becomes the new owner of Time Warner, the motive and opportunity to refuse to license the March Madness games, along with premium cable channel HBO and other content, to pay-TV rivals and online distributors, the Justice Department says. The case is unusual for several reasons. To begin with, President Donald Trump criticized the proposed deal during his campaign and since taking office. AT&amp;T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli had asked for access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the deal, but Judge Leon denied the request. AT&amp;T and Time Warner also are not direct competitors, making the deal a so-called vertical merger between companies on the same supply chain. The vast majority of challenged mergers involve one rival buying another. If the government loses, Verizon Communications Inc and Charter Communications Inc could strike deals to buy movie or television makers and squeeze smaller pay-TV providers. \"I don't know if anyone is big enough to swallow up Netflix but you know they want to,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge. AT&amp;T has said the merger would result in more than US$2.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2020. It also plans to argue the deal is crucial to compete with companies like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc . The internet companies pose two challenges to pay TV. They either compete with cable and satellite television for ad dollars or provide cheaper online video that has hurt pricey pay-TV. Some do both. Consumers could be hurt if AT&amp;T is reluctant to sell Time Warner content to online distributors in order to protect pay-TV at a time of declining subscriptions, Kimmelman said. \"While everyone is very worried about the big tech giants for good reason, this isn  t one of the concerns that makes any sense,\" he said, adding that he welcomed moves by Google and Amazon into video. Apple, Facebook and other vertically integrated tech companies are more powerful than media companies were 50 years ago because they own consumer data they can use to target advertising and predict future purchases, said Andrea Murino, an antitrust lawyer with Goodwin Procter LLP. This, combined with antitrust enforcers' preference for asset sales to resolve competitive concerns, could mean that more vertical deals will be challenged in court, she said.

That certainly boosted markets yesterday. Futures are extending yesterday's gains with a gain this morning of 45 points on the Dow Industrials. S&amp;P up four and the Nasdaq up five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peloton peddles its way forward, pricing its IPO at $29 a share. The high end of the price range despite still not bringing in a profit. What to expect when trading begins today from Peloton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, more trouble for Facebook this morning. Reports of another anti-trust investigation of the technology company, this time from the Justice Department. We've got the very latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>All right, we've got a big show this morning. Joining the conversation, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, back in her seat, \"Wall Street Journal\" wealth manager reporter, host of \"The Secrets of Wealthy Women\" podcast, Veronica Dagher is here, and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, PODCAST HOST, \"SECRETS OF WEALTHY WOMEN\": Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we have a lot to talk about.</p><p>Dagen, missed you. A lot --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Missed you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wanted to get your take on all of these developments this morning.</p><p>Now we've got the whistleblower complaint that we are going to see declassified.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, with the acting director of national intelligence testifying in front of Congress later this morning, declassified last night.</p><p>Again, let the American people see it in, please, rather than having to listen to Adam Schiff and Chuck Schumer tell us what's in it and how disturbed they are by it.</p><p>I'll leave it at this. Are they -- the Democrats really going to try and impeach a president during an election year? That's why we have elections.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And -- and, again, I wonder if the -- the intent of all of this is to essentially destroy the economy and prevent everything from getting done that would benefit the American people, like the Canada-Mexico trade agreement, like, again, getting in the way of President Trump's negotiations with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just raised that question. I don't have answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it does -- it just looks like they're trying to -- not maybe do -- not maybe even impeach him, but just destroy the economy because of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, let's just stop --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because of the uncertainty they foment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's stop everything from moving forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. I mean so -- so that's the -- that's what the markets focus on this story, the fact that there's no USMCA, there's no immigration, there's no health care, there's no infrastructure, nothing gets done legislatively. And it's just amazing to me that they could stand there and pursue these moves when, in fact, at the end, I think markets, investors, voters are going to blame them for that, Steve Forbes. What do you say?</p><p>FORBES: Well, it's going to be a thin excuse when you have six or eight congressional committees getting involved in this thing. But what they should do, if they were serious about it, was to have one select committee, or the Judiciary Committee, instead of every chairman and chairperson, chairwoman getting involved in this thing. So the Republicans should take up the gauntlet and challenge them every step of a way, have a formal vote on whether there's -- this thing should go forward, have them all go on record about it, have them state what they think has gone wrong.</p><p>If you could -- if you can take a call like that and impeach a president in an election year, by golly, everyone -- every president is vulnerable at every single moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: It's preposterous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not only that, but are we opening a precedent that any, you know, private phone call with the president is going to be made public because his skeptics or the adversaries want --</p><p>FORBES: Well, the only -- the only reason the president even did this was to try to show how ridiculous --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: And how, once again, they're playing Russian collusion games. It's the only reason he did it. But he should make clear, and I think he is trying to make clear, this is not a precedent, this is just trying to quash another one of these crazy investigations in its cradle rather than letting it consume them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Somebody needs to stop, needs to say, this has got to stop.</p><p>First two and a half years to have Russia collusion, based on nothing but a dossier that was paid for by the Clinton campaign, now this, pursuing something that the whistleblower doesn't even have direct knowledge of in terms of this --</p><p>FORBES: Hearsay. Hearsay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's all hearsay.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, by the way, \"The New York Post\" page six is reporting exclusively today that Nancy Pelosi, at a VIP dinner here in New York City at the St. Regis, on a Monday night, was dropping hints about impeachment. Monday night. So the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They hadn't seen anything yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, again, the memorandum of this conversation was released, what it, about 10:00 a.m. yesterday. OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, again, that's been -- this has been the -- this has been the plan. And I'll get into the details of this \"New York Post\" report as the morning moves on.</p><p>But, again, this is what they've been planning all along. And when the Mueller report comes out and says no conspiracy, no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, that -- they ended up falling on their faces with that. So I -- it looks like they've been doing for anything to take down the president, who they -- they despise him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. They can't stop him.</p><p>FORBES: What it shows -- what it shows -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They just think -- and why do they despise him? My view, I said this yesterday, they despise him because Donald Trump's presence threatens their existence and they're so obsessed with holding onto their power. He came to Washington. He starts calling everybody out. The swamp this the swamp that. He starts forcing accountability for some of these jobs that people were in for years and did nothing for the American people. And so his presence there threatens their continued power.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and I'll leave -- outside of the left-wing liberal media bubbles of New York, Washington, and the left coast, L.A. and San Francisco, individuals like in -- back where I grew up, all they're asking is, ah, Joe Biden's son was getting paid $50,000 a month --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By a company in Ukraine for what?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Back in the day, that was called influence peddling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll leave --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This -- this in total -- this total exercise is going to blow Joe Biden out of the water, and that's what most people are expecting because --</p><p>DAGHER: And a lot of independent voters also aren't interested in this impeachment issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what Dagen's saying, yes.</p><p>DAGHER: It's not a focus for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It hasn't -- since the Mueller report came out in the spring, I think it was April -- mid-April, that the polling on impeachment -- and granted that was based on the Mueller report -- has been right around, I think, 35 percent to 37 percent. So a little bit more than a third of voters polled have -- have said that they're in favor of impeachment, but that hasn't moved. So, again, when that wasn't working, you move on to something else.</p><p>FORBES: But it also shows the -- how -- how powerful the fringe on the Democratic left is, Pelosi caved to them and she -- the whole party is now marching to their orders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: And it's not going to help them in 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like the Republicans have been saying, AOC is the face of the Democratic Party. And she's co-speaker.</p><p>FORBES: She's -- she's the defacto -- she's the defacto speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's the defacto speaker, exactly.</p><p>OK, we want to continue this conversation throughout the show. We also want to tell you what the president said yesterday about trade. He commented on the impeachment inquiries impact on the USMCA trade deal and the prospects of an agreement with China.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Right now China is way behind us and they'll never catch us if we have smart leadership. Way behind. We've picked up trillions of dollars and they've lost trillions of dollars. And they want to make a deal very badly. It could happen. Could happen.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>TRUMP: It could happen.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>TRUMP: It could happen sooner than you think.</p><p>I don't think Nancy Pelosi will have time. She's wasting her time on a -- you know, let's use a word that they used to use a lot, a manufactured crisis.</p><p>It's phenomenal for farmers. It's good for manufacturers. It's good for everybody. Even the unions want it because they've always hated NAFTA. The unions want it.</p><p>I don't know that they're ever going to get to a vote because they're all fight, the Democrats are all fighting with themselves. So, we'll see. If it happens, it happens, otherwise when we take over the House next year, we'll do it our way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's what some Wall Street reporters yesterday, Wall Street research, were saying that this may very well lead to the House flipping in 2020.</p><p>And, Veronica, do you see a chance of USMCA or a China deal happening?</p><p>DAGHER: You know what, it sounds like it could be less likely now, right, because if the Congress is so tied up with this impeachment inquiry, then things don't get done.</p><p>And, you know, we had a report yesterday just talking about how much our farmers need a deal done. They are suffering. They're having financial difficulties. This is an ongoing story and they are looking to Washington to get something done sooner than later. They have some financial protection for their businesses, but this cannot go on forever for our farmers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And over the near term they actually have to fund the government.</p><p>DAGHER: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's -- there's that as well in the next couple of days.</p><p>FORBES: Well, one of the things that actually may come out of this whole impeachment nonsense is that Pelosi now has the cover to bring USMCA to a vote and not be accused by the left of selling out to Trump and providing some cover for her moderate members. She knows she's got 20 to 30 members who come from districts that can swing very easily. She's not worried about so much AOC, she's worried about those 20 or 30. She's got to give them something to go back and say to the voters, hey, we got something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but, I mean, can you see that happening in the face of all this? Ronna McDaniel, Romney, yesterday sat where you're sitting and she said, we're going right for those Trump, you know, areas where actually they were flipped and a Democrat is there. We're going to go right for them in 2020 and we are going to make this what they're doing in terms of impeachment work for us.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. And that's what Pelosi is word about. She caved to the left. She felt she had to. She lost control of her caucus. So she's got to come up with something that they can go back to their districts and say, hey, for all the headlines, we got something done for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it only takes 18. The Republicans only need 18 seats to flip it back -- flip the House back to red.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And, you know, even though you've seen retirements, I think they are more unified today than they ever have.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're -- I think there are 18 Republican retirements. I think. But 18 is the -- the kind of -- I think it's the round number with the Republican victory in North Carolina recently in the special election.</p><p>FORBES: Two of them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we've got a couple of other pieces of business this morning. IPOs continue strongly. Peloton is going public today. The company pricing its IPO at $29 a share. That is the higher end of the range. For -- this -- this company keeps innovating. We'll see. I mean you're still looking at a no-profit, but you are seeing a growth story within Peloton, I think.</p><p>Reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is the recurrent revenue stream that they built into these machines. Again, it's not about the device, it's about the -- you get hooked on it and you continue to pay month after month after month.</p><p>But, again, with the WeWork disaster, this company looks pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.</p><p>DAGHER: And the subscription model is popular, as you mentioned.</p><p>What's interesting, though, their competitor, Soul Cycle, hasn't yet to become public, right? They keep delaying. There's some talk, when is this going to happen? So you wonder if there's something fundamentally about the business model that makes it difficult for these companies to succeed (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think Soul Cycle's that much of a competitor, because this is, I hate people and I'd rather exercise alone where I don't have to wear makeup and I can sweat just like Richard Nixon.</p><p>DAGHER: Fair point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's actually a really good (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>FORBES: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: I have -- I have a Peloton. It's really a really nice bike.</p><p>DAGHER: I do have one.</p><p>FORBES: It's amazing, self-torture machines and you get rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they have -- and they have treadmills too. Very expensive (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>DAGHER: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then they've got that new thing where it's a mirror. You're in the mirror and you can have a whole yoga class behind you.</p><p>DAGHER: That's really cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, that's what I'm saying, they keep -- they keep innovating.</p><p>DAGHER: Surprise (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: But continued commentary about the private market being overvalued, some of these valuations within the private sector are excessive. We heard that from a lot of people recently. Larry Ellison, Steve Schwarzman, on this program.</p><p>So we'll be watching the pricing here and how it goes public this morning.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Also on deck, New Meta Entertainment CEO Michael Prindiville is here on the big business of gaming. And that is one of the most successful areas of entertainment. Pennsylvania Congressman, House Foreign Affairs Committee member Scott Perry is here on the Iran sanctions. And the Caliber Home Loan CEO Sanjiv Das on lower mortgage rates. Plus, the secretary of NATO, Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg on his meeting with the Ukraine president and, of course, the week that is and is continuing at the U.N. this week.</p><p>A big show this morning. Please join us coming up.</p><p>But first, Hong Kong's future. Leader Carrie Lam is ready to meet with the community in an effort to restore the ongoing political chaos in the city, as millions continue to take to the streets, trying to push back on China's authoritarian rule.</p><p>Then Facebook is in the hot seat again. Attorney General William Barr readying a new anti-trust investigation into the social media giant. We're taking a look at that when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, trying to end the ongoing protests by reaching out to the community now.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria, good morning.</p><p>Carrie Lam out with an op-ed in \"The New York Times.\" It's title, yes, Hong Kong does have a future. In the op-ed she says that she is listening, and that conversation can triumph over conflict. Lam is taking the conversation to the people, holding her first talks with the public today in an attempt to resolve a political crisis that has fueled nearly four months of protest and plunged the Chinese run city into chaos. Lam is going to hold a dialogue with 150 members of a community with each participant given around three minutes to express their views.</p><p>Well, We Work could get a big money boost. \"The Financial Times\" is reporting that Softbank is planning to pump an extra $1 billion, maybe more, into WeWork by renegotiating a warrant deal struck before falling valuations delayed the company's IPO. The plan would increase the Japanese firm's initially planned investment of $1.5 billion in WeWork. WeWork has seen a leadership shake-up and big plans for job cuts in their effort to go public. Again, that is delayed.</p><p>And Walmart is getting into the health care business through its Sam's Club stores. Starting next month, Sam's Club members in Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are going to be able to buy one of four bundles of health care services. They range in price from $50 for individuals to $240 for families. That would be per year. The pilot program could eventually be rolled out to members in every state. Under the program, patients will be diagnosed and treated. Patients without -- that don't want to talk to or even see a doctor can do that as well. Virtual care, right? Patients use an app to describe symptoms to an automated assistant. That uses, of course, AI, Maria. The information gets passed on along to a doctor. Health care, again, going digital, whether it's Skype, or on the phone, or, you know, texting, it's just changing the way that we see our doctors or actually do not see the doctor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it really is and it's important. It's going to be one of the big industries that gets impacted in a good way from technology now.</p><p>Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this -- this comes as -- from the Kaiser Family Foundation report, the cost of employee-provided health coverage topped $20,000 a year for the very first time. The families are paying -- find that the premiums rose 5 percent for family plans. It's the cost of buying an economy car every year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's so -- again, that's the pressure on not just private businesses, but also politicians to bring those costs down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll talk a break.</p><p>When we come back, General Motor workers are still on strike. The automaker and the union may be closer to a deal this morning. We've got the very latest there as buyers and dealers are really starting to feel the effects of this standoff.</p><p>And then Alexa's iconic upgrade. A Hollywood star lending his unmistakable voice to Amazon's home assistant. Find out who when we come back.</p><p>Plus, a stock alert. Beyond Meat shares are soaring this morning after McDonald's says it plans to test a new meatless burger in Canada. Beyond Meat is up almost 10 percent.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, markets have been watching with one eye the impeachment inquiry developments, the deals, of course, on trade, more important there for the market's impact. Yesterday the markets finished higher after the White House released a read-out of the president's July phone call with the Ukrainian president. President Trump was optimistic also about China trade yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is FS Investment's chief U.S. economist Lara Rhame.</p><p>And, Lara, it's good to see you again. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LARA RHAME, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, FS INVESTMENTS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Characterize the economy for us right now.</p><p>RHAME: So relatively solid but lopsided. We're seeing a solid consumer, strong consumer even, but that uneven impact from trade is hitting manufacturing. The concern is whether the sort of rising uncertainty coming at us from different directions is going to spread. It's going to -- the tentacles are going to spread out and impact that consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So any -- any impacts from this impeachment inquiry from your standpoint? What do the last two days mean to markets and investing?</p><p>RHAME: So, you know, markets seemed to have absorbed this fairly well, which is really good news. You know, we had recent data out for the household showing that wealth is higher but it's largely because of equity market gains. When the consumer is overly exposed to the equity market, we start to worry about things like volatility. So the fact that markets are taking it well so far is good.</p><p>FORBES: When -- when is the slowdown in investment, you know, capital expenditures start to hit the consumer side? You have to produce to consume. And do you see any signs of a turnaround there or it's just the uncertainty is going to keep it lower than it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and just let me point out that Vice President Pence, yesterday, when I interviewed him a couple of days ago said CapEx is turning around again. I don't know how you feel about that, but I know a month ago we were talking about CapEx being down. He was adamant in saying, no, no, no, no, look at the most recent reading. It's actually turning again.</p><p>What do you say?</p><p>RHAME: Yes, so I think it's all -- it is a little bit slower, but part of that is just due to the global slowdown. It's when we get slower growth in Germany, when you get slower growth in these other big centers, it's going to naturally -- it's hard to fight gravity in the situation.</p><p>I think what we see in our company is very reticent to lay off workers and that is sort of the other side of CapEx spending. To me, if companies are willing to be a little more cautious on the CapEx spending but keep the workers, for our economy overall that's a really good thing.</p><p>DAGHER: What causes this consumer to fall out of bed?</p><p>RHAME: You know to -- I'm really looking hard at two things, whether or not we start to see the layoff increase. We're getting initial claims this morning. It's a little weekly indicator, but it's actually one of my favorites as a leading indicator for recession. So if we start to see the layoff tick up and they've stayed really low, which is one of the reasons why I'm not buying this recession concern as much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We get GDP today too.</p><p>RHAME: Yes. It's a second quarter -- it's a revision, yes, but absolutely. And I think, you know, now we start to do the math on the third quarter, how that looks. It might be a little bit slower. But, you know, to me it's all about the jobs at that point.</p><p>FORBES: Well, let's be happy for a moment. Let's say there is a China deal. Do you see a spurt in investments as people now know the rules of the road?</p><p>RHAME: I think so. I mean clearly any resolution would be a positive. And markets are reacting very positively. We've seen that day by day for the last year on news on trade.</p><p>I think the concern to me is, you know, we've raised -- this administration has raised the really tough issues with China when you pull that thread, it's hard to knit the sweater back together again. When I -- when I see -- when I see a trade deal, the construct of a trade deal to me would still be one where there's heighten tensions about things like technology, data sharing, cyber security.</p><p>FORBES: Now we're still only -- still -- still only September. When -- when does the market start to react to the prospect -- possible prospect, let's pretend for a moment, Elizabeth Warren gets the Democratic nomination, when do the markets say, we've got to factor that in, the possibility, remote though it may be?</p><p>RHAME: Yes. You know, to me, the 2020 election is going to be a very volatile time for markets. And that's something that I just don't think has been internalized yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not yet.</p><p>RHAME: Yes, not yet at all, because especially if you've got -- you know, think about the out that -- the opposite ends of the spectrum with regulation, financial regulation, health care, you name it for a Trump administration versus, you know, anybody from sort of the farther left of the spectrum, it just creates the uncertainty that could really cause businesses to shut down.</p><p>On the regulatory side, the spending side, I think the volatility we're going to see in the fourth quarter and into 2020 elections is going to be a really rocky ride for investors.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Particularly in health care.</p><p>RHAME: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because, again, you're destroying our standard of living. If you -- if you're going to rip up health care and rip up --</p><p>FORBES: (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>MCDOWELL: How about the -- climate change. Just -- just fighting climate change.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the proposals on that, you're talking about much higher energy prices across the board for the very people who cannot afford it. I -- I don't even know -- I -- I don't even know how you begin to factor that in to any of -- into how you invest in the coming year.</p><p>RHAME: I think energy, though, it's interesting to talk about that at this juncture because the U.S. economy's relationship to energy has changed. We actually see higher energy prices in the U.S. be a positive. It really gives us -- because we produce so much of it now, some of the bigger slowdown that we had in 2015-16 was due to energy prices plunging. It was a net negative for our economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm talking about like $10 to $15 a gallon for gasoline just because -- again, you're evil if you drive a car with an internal combustion engine, because ultimately that -- at least Andrew Yang is talking about that. We're going to have to really just get rid of people owning automobiles and you're going to have rid sharing --</p><p>FORBES: Well they -- all of them just seem to get rid of people, but --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And -- and you're going to -- and we're going to have to essentially tax beef producers and farmers in this country to reduce how much we consume in terms of meat.</p><p>FORBES: And one of the ironies of this whole impeachment thing is it does take focus off of issues that are winners for Democrats, could be, like health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's what Dagen's saying.</p><p>But let me -- let me -- real quick before you go, the third quarter earnings are going to be here in just a couple of weeks. What's price into the market there and do you think things pick up in the fourth quarter in terms of earnings?</p><p>RHAME: I -- you know, I think third quarter -- third quarter earnings are going to be pretty sloppy and are going to set us up for a fourth quarter where we're really torn between, you know, these monetary policies, which are trying to support us, a government, which is really not able to pick up the slack on fiscal stimulus. I think we can see this tug and pull, keeping markets really wrong-footed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll -- well, you're -- you're on the sidelines, it sounds like, for -- in terms of investing in stocks.</p><p>RHAME: I -- I am. I think you need to manage the volatility. You need to manage the downside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RHAME: Choose a strategy, which helps you with that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>RHAME: Because -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we've got to jump.</p><p>Lara, it's great to have you. Thanks so much. Lara Rhame joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook is under pressure again. The social media giant soon to be up against another federal anti-trust investigation. We're taking a look at big tech.</p><p>And then Alexa's vocal upgrade. An iconic actor becomes the new voice of Amazon's home assistant. We'll tell you who it is.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Thursdays morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, September 26th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are indicating a higher opening for stock prices this morning. Take a look at futures, indicating a gain of 50 points on the Dow Industrials right out of the gate. The S&amp;P is up four points and the Nasdaq right now up five.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the final reading of the second quarter GDP today. We will also get the latest numbers on durable goods orders tomorrow. So we've got some economic data that may very well drive markets. And this gain this morning comes on top of gains yesterday across the board. President Trump said midday that a deal with China could come sooner than expected. Markets jumped on the news, finishing up 163 points, two-thirds of 1 percent on the Dow. The S&amp;P was up 18 and the Nasdaq up better than 1 percent, 83 points higher yesterday at 4:00 on Wall Street.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also higher. European indices higher across the board. FT 100 up 76. The CAC quarante in Paris up 38. The DAX index in Germany up 56.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher with the exception of China. As you see there, the best performer was a fractional move. In Hong Kong, up a third of a percent.</p><p>Another investigation to list for FaceBook now. The Justice Department is reportedly probing FaceBook, bringing the total to four. We're going to get into that coming up.</p><p>And then General Motors workers still on strike this morning, but the automaker and the union could be closer to a deal. We have the very latest there.</p><p>The rise of e-sports has major sports teams making big bets and big investments. We will bring you the details later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>But, first, our top story this half an hour, whistleblower fallout. Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire will testify before Congress this morning on the complaint against President Trump and his call to the Ukrainian president. The president weighed in on that call yesterday at the U.N.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's the single greatest witch hunt in American history, probably in history, but in American history. It's a graceful thing. The letter was a great letter, meaning the letter revealing the call. That was done at the insistence of myself and other people that read it. It was a friendly letter. There was no pressure.</p><p>If you notice, the stock market went up when they saw the nonsense. All of a sudden the stock market went down very substantially yesterday when they saw a charge. After they read the charge, the stock market went up very substantially.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the former Whitewater independent counsel and former federal prosecutor, Robert Ray.</p><p>And, Robert, it is always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Good morning. Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to all of this? Let's start there.</p><p>RAY: Well, the president's got it about right, it looks like the market absorbed the information and they're more concerned about China and Iran and the things that we ought to be concerned about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does the president have any vulnerability here? What's your take on this impeachment inquiry?</p><p>RAY: We're on a financial program. I've listened to the Democrats now for months talk about the fact that they're approaching a majority of the majority to decide whether or not to proceed with impeachment. The last time I checked, a majority of the majority does not constitute a majority of the House.</p><p>I don't actually think that the speaker has the votes yet. That's what I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and -- and I'm sure it dies in the Senate. So let's not forget the elephant in the room. This is wasting a lot of people's time because it's not going to go anywhere in the Senate, in my view.</p><p>RAY: Well, look, impeachment, to me, is two things, based in history. You have to show both a high crime and misdemeanor, and you have to show an abuse of power. We've lived through this before. Most recently in the -- during the Clinton saga, the Clinton years.</p><p>Here, you know, they've -- from what I understand, they've tried -- first they tried treason. Well, it's not treason because, you know, somebody helpfully pointed out, Ukraine is an ally, not an enemy.</p><p>The second thing, it's not bribery because the federal bribery statute doesn't apply to foreign government officials.</p><p>Third, it's not extortion because there's no quid pro quo. And the argument that there's a quid pro quo contained in this five page transcript is a bit over the top and ridiculous unless you're going to claim that any time you're talking about foreign assistance on the one hand and asking for an investigation on the other, that that necessarily means that the one was given for the other.</p><p>And then, finally, we know now, as the result of what was disclosed yesterday, that the matter was ultimately referred to the Justice Department for investigation, a criminal referral, and the public integrity section came back and said, it's not an illegal foreign campaign contribution because, guess what, asking for an investigation is not a thing of value to the benefit of -- of Donald Trump personally. So if it's none of those things, that's zero for four, meaning -- meaning that there's no -- no crime has been committed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RAY: And on abuse of power, while you can argue about whether or not, you know, this telephone call was an error in judgment, ultimately at the end of the day what happened? The president released the foreign aid money and there was no untoward investigation in the Ukraine against either Hunter Biden or the vice president.</p><p>So as a result of all of this, I think as you've pointed out, what does this do? It's aimed to potentially damage the president with this continuing,, you know, diatribe about impeachment. At the same time, what does this do? It harms the vice president's campaign and so it gives the Democrats apparently what they want, which is they're going to head in the direction now of Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, get Biden out of the way.</p><p>RAY: And this is a trifecta because it then allows them also to basically, you know, have an excuse for the fact that the Democratic Congress is going to have accomplished nothing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RAY: In the two years of its term leading up to a presidential election. So it only sort of -- to answer your question, ultimately, it reinforces to me, since we will, within a month or so now be in the election year --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RAY: What an exceedingly bad idea it is for the country, and not in the best interest of the country, to be conducting an impeachment proceeding in an election cycle. That's for the voters to decide.</p><p>FORBES: And then -- and you saw in the president's press conference yesterday, the Democrats were more high-handed with Ukraine than anything he did in that telephone conversation. You know, those three senators, earlier in the year, in effect implying to Ukraine, you don't do what we want to do, we're going to cut off your aid. That was overt. There was nothing subtle about that.</p><p>RAY: That's right, Steve. And even with regard to the vice president. the vice president's the only one around who -- who engaged in mafia-like tactics or strong-arm tactics against Ukraine. I mean he was bragging, as the president pointed out in the phone call about the fact that he leveraged Ukraine in order to get rid of a prosecutor they didn't think was, you know, doing his job to weed out corruption. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We haven't heard a lot about Tony Podesta. You know, he was lobbying for years for Ukraine. That -- that should be coming out soon. It's a real spotlight now on Hunter Biden, the Bidens and the Clintons.</p><p>RAY: Right. And, look, I mean, ultimately, as we've tried to point out for months and months and months now, they seem to be very uninterested in getting to the bottom of that. Fortunately for us, the attorney general is focused on that. That's where ultimately I think we're going to find out answers and people will be held to account.</p><p>You know, in the midst of all of this, we're -- we're wasting an enormous amount of time and burning an enormous amount of energy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RAY: And, you know, I think, you know, at the end of the day, the voters are going to ultimately decide whether this was an overreach. Now Nancy Pelosi owns impeachment. And where we go from here is anybody's guess, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's what Dagen said actually at the top of the show, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to know, though, in the -- in the short run where this goes, with the acting director of national intelligence, Maguire, as you pointed out, testifying publicly in front of the House Intelligence Committee later today. The whistleblower complaint according to reporting has been declassified, although not yet made public.</p><p>But Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who was, again, on the Senate side, has had the ability to look at it, said he found the report troubling. He said the administration ought not to be attacking the whistleblower as some talking points suggest they plan to do. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports the complaint might contain additional information and is based on a series of events.</p><p>So we're going to hear from the -- I -- the public will likely get to see this. I hope everyone reads it.</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As they should have read the Mueller report.</p><p>But, again, how quickly does this get buttoned up, if you will, Robert?</p><p>RAY: I don't know --</p><p>MCDOWELL: This whistleblower complaint and the testimony.</p><p>RAY: I don't know because I haven't -- I haven't seen the whistleblower complaint, although other --</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) yet.</p><p>RAY: Other members of Congress have suggested, after having looked at it last night, that it really doesn't do anything other than provide corroborating details to the fact that the conversation occurred. Well, hello, we now have the conversation between the two presidents. Is there really much more to it than that? I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Ben Sasse --</p><p>BARTIROMO: See, I'm not -- I'm not surprised that the president would say, you know, look, there's corruption, we want to know what happened in 2016. A lot of op-eds this morning in \"The Journal\" basically saying, look, it was bad judgment. The president did not have to bring up Joe Biden's son, did not have to bring up this stuff, probably should not have gone there at all, but there was no mention in that transcript of quid pro quo.</p><p>RAY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There was no mention of aid at all.</p><p>RAY: Which apparently \"The LA Times\" concedes. So, you know, look, I mean, I've looked at it, too. I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Someone call CNN and MSNBC because obviously they're not reading the actual facts.</p><p>RAY: No. And if you're listen to Ocasio-Cortez, apparently we're supposed to impeach a president based upon the fact that there's been a deviation from democratic norms, whatever the heck that means.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And Nancy Pelosi, yesterday, said -- or two days ago said, it doesn't matter if there's no quid pro quo, just the fact that he brought it up is a problem for us. That's impeachable according to her.</p><p>RAY: Well, that -- that's a nice thing to say. And while the Constitution itself doesn't provide explicit guidance, you know, we do have a history here. We've been at this for 240 years. We've lived through Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and now this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but after what -- after what this president has been through where the entire country was in hysteria over potential collusion with Russia and the media was driving the bus on it, I can understand the frustration there that he wants to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>RAY: He was actually kind of whistle about that yesterday. I'm sure he'll recover from that today. But the -- the -- you know, the long and short of it is, he's right about the fact very few people would be able to actually continue to withstand this and to wake --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true.</p><p>RAY: And to wake up every morning, as he says, and put his suit on and go back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RAY: And, ultimately, the American people are going to judge this. And if - - if what happens as a result of this, that the Democrats lose control of the House, they can look back to yesterday and Nancy Pelosi's action as the reason why it occurred.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just really quickly. How long -- how long would this take in terms of the impeachment process?</p><p>RAY: Well, they're -- Jerry Nadler's apparently saying, oh, you know, we hope to get this done by the end of the year. I have to tell you, again, my marker is, if they haven't done anything by the date in November which constitutes the one-year marker between there and the election in 2020 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Forget about it.</p><p>RAY: It's too late.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Too late.</p><p>RAY: So they're -- I can tell they're scrambling around trying to, you know, hustle here because they know an impeach proceeding within an election year is not in the best interest of the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Isn't the timing very curious.</p><p>RAY: Yes, isn't it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and if they don't get -- if they don't get USMCA done by October 21st, which is the Canada election, I don't think it gets done at all.</p><p>And, by the way, after all of this, I don't think it gets done.</p><p>RAY: Right and not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here we are. It doesn't get done. That's it (ph).</p><p>RAY: And this is all assuming regularity. What happens if, you know, some things that we can't foresee, you know, happen with regard to the United States on things that we should be worrying about?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RAY: The country is going to have very little toleration for this if we've got a crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Robert, good to see you. Thank you. Robert Ray.</p><p>RAY: Good to see you. Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back with the headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The General Motor strike not just affecting workers, it is starting to take a toll on customers and dealerships,</p><p>Cheryl Casone on headlines now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria, the strike has caused a shortage of parts, delaying repairs for trucks, cars and SUVs. And dealers are starting to run low on some of their models. Job action in its 11th day today. Progress is now being reported, though, at the bargaining table as GM and the United Autoworkers are looking to both end the walkout. So we'll see if we get something today on that. There's a one month chart of GM, by the way.</p><p>Ninety-five countries now have military drones. That's according to a new report from the center for the study of the drone. Back in 2010, only about 60 countries actually have them. As part of her AI special, Maria spoke with Palmer Luckey, the founder of defense technology company Anduril Industries about how technology is changing militaries around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALMER LUCKEY, FOUNDER, ANDURIL INDUSTRIES: The ultimate idea is to give soldiers and other first responders a perfect picture of everything that's going on around them and also a perfect picture of what's going to be happening in the near future. What's going to happen is that AI is going to be used to allow people to plan better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, China Israel, and the United States are the top exporters of drones according to the report.</p><p>And Alexa has a new voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMUEL L. JACKSON, ACTOR, \"SNAKES ON A PLANE\": Enough is enough. I have had it with these (EXPLETIVE DELETED) snakes on this (EXPLETIVE DELETED) plane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: A very colorful voice, indeed. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"Snakes on a Plane.\"</p><p>CASONE: I know. Samuel L. Jackson and other celebrities can tell you jokes, give you the weather, play music. This upgrade is going to cost 99 cents. It's available on new versions of, Maria, the Echo devices. Whether or not you get the f-bombs, I don't know, but, anyway, it's up to you, I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The whole time.</p><p>FORBES: Those old (INAUDIBLE). Those old voice male (INAUDIBLE) phone services where you can put Nixon's voice in, or somebody else's voices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.</p><p>FORBES: The same sort of thing. It's alive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's very funny.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A quick break, and then the rise of e-sports. How the gaming industry is involving the investment of major sports teams. We're going to check it out when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are looking at the big business of e-sports. Digital sports and entertainment company New Meta Entertainment launching today. It is backed by some of the biggest sports teams, like the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Devils, Houston Rockets and the Boston Bruins. The company announcing this morning is has raised $30 million in funding.</p><p>And joining us right now is the CEO of New Meta Entertainment, Michael Prindiville.</p><p>Great to see you, Michael. Thanks so much for join us.</p><p>MICHAEL PRINDIVILLE, CEO, NEW META ENTERTAINMENT: Thank you for having me. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations.</p><p>Tell us about the company.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: OK. The company, New Meta Entertainment, essentially a parent company. Again, the investor base, including NBA teams like the Philadelphia 76ers, the Houston Rockets, as well as NHL teams like the Devils and Bruins through Delaware North. Basically just reflecting a seismic, massive change in the world of digital sports and entertainment, right?</p><p>We used to think just about e-sports as the key for gaming. Now it's really broader than that. It's that total gaming audience. And this business effectively reflects, you know, three key parts, which is e-sports, content and investments. And, you know, at the end of the day, we are building a gaming and media company that we think reflects this systemic change in the world.</p><p>DAGHER: How come gaming is so popular among the younger folks?</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: I mean I just think it's about evolution, right?</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: So we grew up in our backyard playing wiffle ball or soccer. The last 20 to 30 years, the kids have been playing video games, right? Technology has been advancing. They've been able to talk to their friends, not just in the room, but on the other side of the planet. And those form of communications, combined with the skills and the level of complexity of these games have captured an audience, captured those eyeballs and driven them away from more traditional forms of entertainment like TV and other videos on the Internet, really.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And --</p><p>FORBES: So you're going to see more things like they had in Madison Square Garden, or in South Korea, you get 40,000 people coming to these tournaments and are we going tell our kids, now grandkids, you can make a living as a video coach, as many people are doing now?</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: I think it's -- I think it's been proven, right?</p><p>DAGHER: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: Like, we learned about a month ago, through the Fortnite world championships, where a young 16-year-old won $3 million, right? So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes, that was great.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: That's a nice little sum of money.</p><p>DAGHER: (INAUDIBLE), yes.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: You know, and this -- this weekend, in Brooklyn here, ESL 1 will be packing the Barclay Center down in the Wells Fargo Center, Overwatch (ph) will be having their world championships. That will be sold out. And, you know, I happen to be getting on a plane to Berlin later tonight for the League of Legends World Champions --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: Which will be in -- in Europe. (INAUDIBLE), my organization will be playing in it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Legal Legends was one of the first to really -- to do the kind of big superdome competitions.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, talk about moving away from the consoles, that -- the real gold in gaming, broadly speaking, is to like you just game on this and nothing else. You don't need to be tethered to as great as the graphics are, as great as the technology is and the visual. You can just game on your phone. You're not going to need to be tethered to an xBox or a PlayStation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think that's why the growth has ramped up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or even a computer --</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: Well, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You can take it with you. It's on the go.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: So it's pretty amazing, right? So in the world of competitive gaming, the elite form comes on a high-powered PC. People still play console. People play games on their phone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did say -- I did say play -- I did say PC too.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: Of course --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I meant like being tethered to a machine.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: No, but I think your point was great, right, because I can be on the subway and I can see someone playing Candy Crush and you can literally go up to them and say, hey, are you a gamer? And they'll be like, ah, I'm not a gamer. Literally you -- for the last half hour you've been looking at your phone playing Candy Crush, right? We're all gamers more than we think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, congrats, Michael. We're going to be watching the developments. Thanks so much.</p><p>PRINDIVILLE: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael Prindiville joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, impeachment inquiry is looming. President Trump is still pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over USMCA. Where are we on that? That's next</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019092601cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4N-5CD1-DXH2-651T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8044\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Facebook morning, this morning, the social media giant setting aside $5 billion for expected privacy violation fines.  Then, Mark Zuckerberg's podcast debut as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble for Tesla to report, the company posted big loss after a decline in Model 3 deliveries, then details on Elon Musk's new insurance program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carlos Ghosn could be released from jail any moment, we are waiting for details.  The former Nissan chief granted bail.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets this is morning, trading -- take a look at markets this is morning, as we wait for earnings this morning, which, of course, has been setting the tone in Futures this morning, look like, really a mixed opening, is what we are expecting after yesterday's close, which was a decline.</p><p>The major technology stocks reporting yesterday, activity ahead of some earnings this morning, Facebook shares are jumping in late trading yesterday, after reporting positive first-quarter earnings, as the technology giant is also expected to face a multi-billion-dollar federal trade commission fine, Dagen is looking at that this morning.  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria, this one time reserve $3 billion that Facebook has set aside to cover this expected Federal Trade Commission fine did eat into its earnings, more on its profits and bottom line, in a moment.</p><p>But this $3 billion is the expected fine from the FTC over privacy violations, a multi-billion-dollar penalty of this size would likely be the largest ever, against a major U.S. tech company, also the largest privacy fine in FTC history.</p><p>Why the fine?  Facebook, back in 2012, agreed not to collect personal data and share it without user consent.  This is part of the settlement with the FTC, but the agency has been looking into the Cambridge Analytica Scandal where the data of tens of millions of users was transferred to that -- essentially campaign firm, this data firm, during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>So, this is a sign that the case could be winding down -- $3 billion -- the range of the expected fine was $3 to $5 billion, but FTC has not given us any deadline.  Let's take a look at the earnings, earnings per share did come in higher than expected; although, profits dropped by more than half to $2.43 billion in the first quarter, in part, because of that one-time reserve wiped out most of its income.</p><p>Facebook posted $15.08 billion in revenue that was up 26 percent from the year, earlier period.  Take a quick look at the stock, it is up 39 percent year to date, and it's popping an aftermarket and I quickly want to get hard rap, I will send it back to you more on the podcast, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to talk more about that.  I know on Facebook, we've got a lot of news, Dagen, but we want to tell you that Joe Biden has, in fact, announced this morning, that he is running for president.</p><p>He just released that on Twitter, the former vice president tweeted this, the core values of this country are standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America is at stake.  That is why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.  #Joe2020.</p><p>Joining me right now is Democratic Political Analyst, John Hopkins University Professor, Wendy Osefo, great to see you sir -- Wendy, thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction, we were expecting Joe Biden to jump in and he has.</p><p>WENDY OSEFO, DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ANALYST:  He's in.  And I think a lot of people have been waiting for this moment, especially on the Democratic side and now, we have the official word from him that he's in.  I mean, he goes into this race, leading not only Trump, but also he's fellow Democrats in the race.</p><p>A recent POLITICO poll has him leading Trump at eight percentage points, 42 to 34.  He's leading when it comes to millennials at 14 percent, when it comes to women, at 22 percent, so these are big numbers here.  I think we have to look out for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.  These are places where Bernie Sanders has a stronghold on New Hampshire.</p><p>Kamala Harris has a stronghold on that African-American base in South Carolina.  But, overall, I think that what we see here is what the numbers alone.  He has a very strong chance of winning.  But I will say this, this is not going to be an easy run for him, he has to rectify issues when it comes to why did he vote to enter the Iraq war, why did he vote against busting to integrate, you know, racial equality.</p><p>There are issues that Joe Biden has to face, so this is going to be an uphill battle.  But the numbers show, if we just look at the sheer demographics of this, he is the leading candidate, not just for Democrats, but for 2020, as a whole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because some people in the party would say Bernie Sanders is the leading candidate.  He's been an incredible fundraiser, even President Obama and Michelle Obama said yesterday that they are not going to vote for anybody.</p><p>They're not getting behind anybody in the primary season.  They say they're going to wait for the voters to decide, and then they'll probably get behind, obviously, whoever the candidate is.  Did you find that interesting that President Obama is not coming out strong behind Biden?</p><p>OSEFO:  I think that what's going on right now, the Democrats is the overall arching goal, is they want someone to beat Trump.  So, whoever that person is, whoever it is, they do not want to muddy the waters.  They want the people to decide and vote with their feet and vote with their thoughts.</p><p>And with that being said, what they're saying here is, we're not going to back anyone because we want to make sure that when it comes to 2020, we do not have any inclination of us possibly losing.  We want to make sure we win this.</p><p>So, even though, you know, Obama calls Joe Biden his brother, he does not want to get into this too early.  And I think that that's actually a good approach, because myself, and as well as other Democrats and strategists, what we're saying here is whoever wins our party's nomination is who we're going to go for because that's how strongly we feel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  But, I mean, does, you know, Biden need the push from Obama now, to get, you know, the lead, because this is a tight race.  You know that there are --</p><p>OSEFO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a radical arm of the party that wants Elizabeth Warren, that wants Bernie Sanders, to have big federal programs like Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, AOC, so don't you think Joe Biden needs Obama now, not to necessarily wait until the, you know, party decides?</p><p>OSEFO:  I don't necessarily think so.  I think that having Obama now could possibly muddy the waters because when Obama left his presidency, there were some Democrats who were not necessarily happy about things that he left on the table and did not complete.</p><p>So, even though Obama is our party favorite, I think, right now, we're just trying see what each candidate can do on their own, even though Elizabeth Warren is not necessarily leading, she is definitely the one when it comes to policy, she is one of the only few, out of the 20 Democrats, who have hard-core policies, and says this is what she's going to do.</p><p>So, you know, even though Obama would be great as far as fanfare, right now, we just want to see what each candidate is bringing to the table as far as policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right.  Let me ask you about the fallout from the Mueller report and whether or not this has any impact, because Hillary Clinton is out with a new op-ed in the Washington Post this morning, titled, Mueller documented a serious crime against all Americans.</p><p>Here how respond in it, she calls for Democrats to hold off on impeachment efforts, saying that the debate about how to respond to Russia's sweeping and systematic attack, and how to hold President Trump accountable for obstructing the investigation and possibly breaking the law has been reduce to a false choice: immediate impeachment or nothing.</p><p>History suggests there's a better way to think about the choices ahead.</p><p>What's your reaction to this, especially since we know that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier, was tangled up with Russians to actually try to get dirt on Donald Trump.  There's a whole investigation now going on in terms of how that investigation into Donald Trump started because it was no predicate.</p><p>We know that the FBI handled her with kid gloves, that she really wasn't investigated over her e-mail scandal.  There's a story today that her e-mails actually were found in the Obama White House now, the fact that she's writing op-eds and out there on stage, talking about this, what's your reaction, Wendy?</p><p>OSEFO:  I believe she's a private citizen, so she has the right to do so, even though she was former First Lady, even though she was, you know, Secretary of State, she still has the right to be a private citizen, and when it comes to the Mueller report, it's something that definitely impacts all of us.</p><p>I think that she does bring a good point, whether you sit on the left side or the right side of the aisle, which is, you know, we are faced with two choices, and those two choices are not really good ones, which is, you know, impeachment right now, or just do nothing.</p><p>I think there has to be a middle-of-the-road here because what we see from that report is something did happen, and at what point do we hold the President of the United States accountable for what the report says, and that's what she's bringing up here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we know something happened.  We know that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier.</p><p>OSEFO:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That they got the dossier to find out this dirt on Donald Trump, which actually was unverified and solicitous.  That's what happened.</p><p>OSEFO:  Well, you know, and then I can also say what happened is that the Russians went ahead and tried to interfere with our Democratic process, in favor of Donald J. Trump.  And that is an issue, and that is something that not only affects Hillary Clinton, as well as Donald Trump, that's something that affects 2020, whether we're going to make sure that whoever goes forward for 2020, we do not allow a power like Russia, a nefarious power, to interfere in our Democratic process --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting, because we knew -- we knew that Russia was trying to meddle into the west's dealings back in 2012 and 2014, why do you think President Obama and Hillary Clinton never did anything about it?</p><p>OSEFO:  I think he did try to do something about it, I definitely do.  I do believe that it's not something that was finished, that's what I'm saying about, you know, there's certain people on the left side that have issues with what happened with Obama and the things that he left on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>OSEFO:  But I do believe that now that Trump is in office, that he is the President of the United States, the question then becomes what is he currently doing about it?  And right now, there's nothing he's doing about it, and that is an issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Wendy, thanks very much, we're going to keep following this.</p><p>OSEFO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, Joe Biden is on Twitter, he is officially in the race, running for president.  Joining me right now on the telephone is Mark Penn, he is Senior Adviser to the -- he was Senior Adviser to the Clintons, he is the President of the Stagwell Group, and Mark, it's always great to have you here, what's your reaction to Joe Biden jumping in here?</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP (through telephone):  Well, I think that he's jumping in clearly as a values-oriented moderate (INAUDIBLE) at his announcement, he's not -- he's not stressing Medicare-for-All, Green New Deal, he's stressing at those he's concerned about the middle class.  He's concerned about climate change.  He's got real concern about equality.</p><p>So, he seemed like he's got a history of having been a vice president, stood side by side with President Obama, so he's coming out to say, I have values, I think that -- and he says that Trump is off, in terms -- in terms of the values.  I'm really going to fight for the middle class and for equality.</p><p>I really work for Obama.  And by inference, he's coming in as a moderate to take out that crowd.  The values (INAUDIBLE) first person we've seen enter lately, who's really staked out this ground.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you know, it's a good point in terms of the moderate point that you make, because there's this radical arm in Democratic Party, as you know.</p><p>Do you think he's going to be able to push through and be the candidate, even as you've got people like Bernie Sanders raising so much money and coming up with socialist programs, Elizabeth Warren also, really radical on the left, AOC, is he going to be able to have his voice heard, in a moderate way?</p><p>PENN:  Well, even though he hasn't been in the race, he's been -- he's been polling number one, he has a constituency, you know, somewhat more than a third.  His problem is that constituency may or may not be in Iowa, it certainly is in the kind of broad big states, where Democrats, you know, particularly the Northeastern states, he's got, I think, a real constituency throughout the party.</p><p>He's not going to easily win and he's not going to be easily beaten.  There's a lot fire and energy behind Sanders, right now, and some of the -- some of the new exciting candidates, but you know -- you know, he's got a reasonable chance here.  He's clearly in the top 3, and we'll see how he gets out of the gate.</p><p>But he's clearly staked out to me, a ground that's moderate, that's not as radical, that says, hey, I'm an alternative who's going to bring sensible policies that will fit to the middle class, and you know, that at least gives Democrats a real choice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about President Obama saying that he's going stay on the sidelines?  That he's not going to endorse anybody during primary race?  I mean, here we have Joe Biden, his former vice president, jumping in the race, and his former partner, President Obama, is not going to be there to endorse him.</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think like it or not, Obama has said clearly, I thought that he thinks that Biden was a great vice president, but he's not necessarily endorsing him as the -- as the -- as the person who should be the next president, and I think he's always been clear about that.</p><p>I think he's -- and he said he's going to, kind of, sit back and not take an active role in this campaign, and you know, that's always disappointing when you served somebody for that many years, but there is something of a history in that.  Remember (INAUDIBLE) Nixon?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  All right, Mark, thanks so much, we will see you soon, Mark Penn, more on Joe Biden's entry in the 2020 race when we come back.  Plus, Carlos Ghosn may be released from prison, all that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we have breaking news this morning, it is official, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race, joining the conversation this morning, Assistant Editorial Page Editor at the Wall Street Journal, James Freeman is here, along with PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle, good morning, gentlemen.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Joe Biden in the race, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, can be interesting to see who he is as a candidate this time, does he want to show how woke he is, in which case, I think you'd say what's the point of the candidacy, or is he going to stake out that moderate pro-business path that a lot of check writers in the city, on the Democratic side, are hoping for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point, the check writers.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWCUS:  It should be interesting to see if we re-litigate the last, you know, the eight years of the Obama administration.  That becomes the really big issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Here's Joe Biden, breaking the news.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe history will look back on four years of this president, and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.  But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand-by and watch that happen.</p><p>The core values of this nation are standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America is at stake.  That's why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.  Folks America is an idea.  An idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.  It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth.</p><p>It guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity.  And gives hate no safe harbor.  It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve if you work at it.  That's what we believe.  And above all else that's what's at stake in this election.</p><p>We can't forget what happened in Charlottesville.  Even more important, we have to remember who we are.  This is America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the 2020 race is on, your reaction, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That someone -- big Democratic voter described Joe Biden as a mensch.  And I think that that is really somebody who's thoughtful and caring, and I think that's going to have to come out.</p><p>Also, he's got the ability to kind of swoop in when Medicare-for-All is kind of the phrase of the moment which, again, eradicates private insurance in the country, and just come in and say I want to sure up Obamacare.  Here are my fixes for it.  It's working.  I don't want to change it -- change it too much.</p><p>Here is how we're going to fix this.  Again, you are banned from using the word, woke, ever again, James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that there was a quick clip of Martin Luther King in that video.  And I will point out that Bernie Sanders was booed at this She the People Summit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it was yesterday, for name-dropping Martin Luther King, Jr., saying I was on -- I marched on Washington with Dr. King and he got booed.  It was very uncomfortable.  He kept putting his finger up like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again, Joe Biden brings in something to the Democratic nomination race that other people don't have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is he going to be able to push through that will pass these radicals?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because he's not a radical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Well, we will see, we will see what the -- what the Biden 2020 looks like.  I think -- I think he has an opportunity, but it's a question about that 25 or 30 percent that gets in every poll of Democrats, is that name I.D., is that Obama nostalgia, or is it this hunger that we hear in this city for economic sanity in the Democratic field?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even as Obama is not endorsing him.  I find that really odd that President Obama and Michelle said yesterday, they're going to stay on the sidelines.  They're not going to get behind any Democratic candidate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that was -- that was something that in Democratic circles was known.  That President Obama and Michelle were not going to come out and endorse anybody, not until it was pretty clear who the nominee would be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, more on Joe Biden's entry into 2020 race this morning, plus Carlos Ghosn may be released from prison this morning.  We're going to have the details when we come back, stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Trump to send troops.  The President declares he'll bring armed soldiers south, but will the American people be on board with the border move?  Tom Homan breaks it all down on \"DOBBS\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, it is official this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race, we have more coming up throughout the morning on this, but first, we want to get to headlines, Carlos Ghosn could be released from Tokyo jail this morning, Cheryl Casone with more details there and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We're monitoring any breaking news out of Japan, Maria, the former Nissan chairman has been granted bail for a second time, after being arrested back in November, on charges of financial conduct.</p><p>Ghosn will walk out after posting that $4-1/2 million in bail.  He continues to deny the charges against him, including this latest one, a breach of trust for allegedly diverting $5 million of Nissan money.</p><p>Well, Deutsche Bank has ended merger talks with Commerce Bank, we got that news this morning, a deal expected to be announced as soon as Friday.  The Wall Street Journal reports the agreement lack investor support and opposition from the Labor Unions.</p><p>A merger between the two ailing banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution, but that'll all change today.</p><p>Slack technologies moving forward with plans to go public, on the New York Stock Exchange, the Wall Street Journal reports the company expected to reveal its prospectus soon.  Slack is one of the latest tech companies that's looking to make its trading debut during a really hot IPO market, through a direct listing, which doesn't require raising money or using underwriters.</p><p>So, we'll see if we get that news as well.  So, we are watching any, of course, any pictures out of Japan, Maria, we'll bring them to you if we get them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and Slack has been talked about, a lot of excitement about that deal.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we'll watch that as well, Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a lot going on this morning certainly with Biden, entering the race, as well as other news around the Mueller report, what are you following this morning, your reaction, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think the Biden candidacy is interesting, see if it creates a much-up problem for Trump in the Midwest.  Biden moved out of Scranton, Pennsylvania during the Eisenhower administration, but if he -- if he tasked himself as speaking for blue-collared voters, might create a problem for Trump in the Midwest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you raised this issue as well, in terms of all of the other candidates being further left and Joe Biden for the most part.  I think that Tim Ryan is the only one -- other one who's a real moderate.  But he's going to have to answer to the Democratic primary voters on issues like he voted for the crime bill, he voted for welfare reform, he voted for repeal Glass-Steagall, as well.</p><p>So, he's got such a long history in the Senate.  There's a -- there's a lot for them to use against him, a lot of mud to swing in his direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there are so many radicals in the race right now, on the Democratic side.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the question is, if you look at Midterms, suburban voters really made a difference, and Joe Biden could very well appeal to those suburban voters and some of these radicals probably don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, a lot more coming up, Joe Biden is in the 2020 presidential race, the former vice president, adding his name to the crowded Democratic field this morning.  We've got all of the rollout highlights coming up.  He's calling it the values of his campaign.  We'll bring those to you.</p><p>And then, golden arches for golden years, details on McDonald's new partnership with AARP, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 25th.</p><p>We have \"BREAKING NEWS\" this morning.  It is now official, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.  We will talk with former DNC chair, Donna Brazile, this morning about what his candidacy means to the already crowded field of contenders, coming up.</p><p>Earnings in focus, of course, Wall Street, Dow component, 3M with the earnings in moments along with Southwest Airlines, whose fleet of 737 MAX jets remain grounded.</p><p>After develop tonight, we will hear from Amazon as well as Ford Motor and Starbucks who are bringing all of those numbers.  And full analysis coming up.</p><p>Markets this morning look like this.  Take a look at the Futures indicating a mixed story at the start of trading.  Dow Futures are down 56 points, quarter of a percent.  But the S&amp;P Futures up a quarter, and the NASDAQ up 14-1/2 right now.</p><p>Yesterday, a market snapped a three-day winning streak.  Take a look at the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ.  Yesterday, we saw the markets retreating from record highs reversing any gains by the closed.  Dow Industrials are down 59 points.  And the S&amp;P 500, down 6-1/2.  The NASDAQ down 18 points.</p><p>In Europe this morning here's the action right now.  And it is lower across the board.  FT-100, down 25 points.  CAC Quarante in Paris is down 9-1/2.  And the DAX index in Germany down 2-1/2 points.  Fractional moves there, but lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the numbers where Japan was higher, but the Shanghai Composite in China down two and a half percent that really set the tone for markets.  The Bank of Japan said that it will hold rates at zero until spring of 2020.  There is concern about slowing growth, reaching its two percent inflation objective in Japan.</p><p>Southwest Airlines is hitting the tape right now.  As you can see, the earnings at $0.70 share, versus an estimates, $0.61 a share.  That's better than expected.  Revenue also better than expected.</p><p>Ashley Webster is on this news right now.  He is checking on earnings for the first quarter.  Ashley, over to you.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  As you said, there on the headline numbers.  Maria, good morning to you.  $0.70 on earnings per share that is a beat, the estimate was $0.61 on revenue.  A hair -- a hair beat, if you like.  $5.15 billion, the estimate was $5.12 billion.</p><p>More interesting, though, we want to know the impact to the grounding of those 737 MAX jets.  Southwest, says the revenue impact from the grounding of those planes in addition to the government shutdown in this quarter, and other factors, says the airline has had a revenue impact of more than $200 million.</p><p>So, that's kind of important.  Those MAX jets account for about four percent of passenger capacity as well.  So, those headwinds more than $200 million of those MAX groundings, and also the government shutdown.</p><p>So, other than that, the headline numbers are pretty good.  Their guidance remains in line with what they gave in the last quarter at the end of 2018.  They say that the fuel costs also are flat.</p><p>We're also just getting 3M, Maria.  Let me just take a little bit of time to jump into those.  And we have a --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I know that 3M looks like a missed, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  While you get those numbers together.  This is an important one because this is really an indicator of economic growth, not just the U.S. but really the global story.  So, 3M shares right now are down fractionally.  What can you tell us about the 3M quarter, Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, just having you know, look, as you say, bad miss and earnings per share at 223.  Estimate was 249, revenue at $7.86 billion.  The estimate was for $8.02 billion.  So, a miss on top on bottom line.  That's going to hurt the stock for sure.  Says, the operating margin of 14.4 percent.  That's a little light.  The consumer sales coming in at $1.2 billion.</p><p>About inline, healthcare sales.  I mean, this is a conglomerate that covers many areas.  Healthcare sales, $1.54 billion which again is just a little light.  So, a miss on earnings for 3M, and also, a miss on revenue that's going to hurt the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and it's also talking about fiscal 2019 earnings at 8:53 to 9:03 on 3M.  The first quarter was below estimates, but it's only a fractional loss in the stock right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is announcing a realignment of the company from five to four business groups.  We'll come back to you on more details about that actually.  Thanks so much.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We do have \"BREAKING NEWS\" this morning.  As we have been reporting, Joe Biden, announcing he is running for president.  He made the announcements on YouTube earlier this hour.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  I believe history look back on four years of this president, and all the embraces as an aberrant moment in time.  But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are.  And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy.  Everything that has made America, America is at stake.  That's why today, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we have a lot more coming up this morning.  Plus, former DNC chair Donna Brazile is going to be weighing in, in the next hour.  Stay with us for that interview.</p><p>We want to also take a look at earnings this morning.  Facebook, reporting first-quarter results.  Beating on both earnings per share and revenue, the company attributing those strong numbers to growth in stories, users, and ads.</p><p>Microsoft posted a double beat as well late last night.  The company moved past a trillion dollars in market value.  Just the third to hit this valuation after Apple and Amazon as the numbers were better than expected.  As you see, earnings of $1 a share on -- that was the estimate.  As you see, the actual earnings for $1.14 share.  Revenue at $30.57 billion, better than the estimate of $29.8 billion.</p><p>Amazon releases its first-quarter numbers later this afternoon.  And joining us right now is Disruptive Tech Research founder, Lou Basenese.  Lou, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Lou Basenese with us right now.</p><p>Your reaction to the earnings we've shown at to close yesterday.</p><p>LOUIS BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH:  Start off with Facebook.  I'm probably the only one that's not cheering it.  And it's not -- it's not because I don't own the stock and missed out.  It's not sour grapes, it's because I think we're rewarding bad behavior.  As Dagen mentioned earlier in the show, there's a $3 billion -- possibly, a $5 billion fine that's going to be paid, and investors are just shrugging it off like it's no big deal.</p><p>Facebook has been a serial offender of privacy, and we're just letting them go undeterred and unpunished for.  And I just -- you know, I can't get behind that as an investor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.  Stock is up 8-1/2 percent right now.  But I mean, that's their business, Dagen.  I mean, they sell our data to advertisers.  So, I agree, I mean -- you know, this is the business model.  Is this going to works long-term?  Is this going to be sustainable?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I -- if you dig into the actual numbers, I know that the revenue was up 26 percent.  But and its average daily users was 1.56 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was up eight percent.  But there is virtually no user growth in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and that is 70 percent of the company's revenue.  The average revenue per user was up, but I think that if you have to look at its core markets and its growth there.  And independent research separately suggests they spend -- people are spending less time on Facebook.  That's a worry.</p><p>And, by the way, the stock is up even before today up 39 percent year today.  But in terms of the regulatory heat, if you look overseas, it's much worse.  Facebook faces 10 different inquiries from its primary regular.  The Irish Data Protection Commission, and even in Australia in New Zealand, they have threatened throwing Facebook executives' personal funds of jail.  Because of say, when the math the New Zealand massacre was broadcast live on Facebook.</p><p>Because there is been zero responsibility in terms of preventing this kind of horrific video from being live-streamed.  Suicides, murders, even the massacre in New Zealand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you know, you make a good point.  Europe has been so much steeper in terms of the regulatory bite on these social media companies than the U.S.  I don't think people want to see the U.S. be as aggressive as Europe has been.  However, there seems like there's been a tipping point.  Something will get done.</p><p>I don't know.  Will it be a break up of some of these companies?  Will it be more regulation?  What do you guys think?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, right now, I think Congress is going to spend the rest of this term fighting over what we're going to do with the Mueller report as opposed to convening panels to figure out a regulated industry. BARTIROMO:  Well, that's true, too.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But I do think, beyond this Congress, I think consumers, investors, ought to be concerned about a big deal in privacy, more regulation.  The big incumbents, cutting a deal with Washington that gives them protection against new competitors.</p><p>And I guess, Lou, that's what I wonder.  You look at these results, and on the one hand, you could say, users don't care about these issues as much as reporters and regulators do.</p><p>Or do you look at these results and say, people feel like they have no choice they need Facebook, they don't have an option.</p><p>BASENESE:  Look, I would say it's analogous to this generation's big tobacco.  We're addicted to these platforms.  Whether it's for news or connection.  And because as consumers, we're addicted to it, the advertisers are addicted to it.  They can go nowhere else, and get an audience of 2 billion-plus users at once.</p><p>So, it's this -- it's sad -- it's a sad testament.  But the business fundamentalists are super strong.  But the underlying ethics to that business -- you know, Maria mention it too like their business is collecting our data, to then, in turn, sell it to others.  That's the product.  It's over 90 -- 98 percent of the revenue.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And maybe that's a good trade.  Isn't that what this is the results say?</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, and I think we've talked about this before, James.  It's a -- it's a trade, we're making in exchange, but where is the boundary, right?  How much is too much?  How much -- how much information is giving -- are we going to give away?  How much are we willing to give away for them to sell?  And I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's -- the issue with Facebook is also that Facebook promised to stop this behavior and it didn't.</p><p>BASENESE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it keeps promising to, \"We're going to do better, we're going to do better.\"  That podcast from Mark Zuckerberg, now he's going to be preaching about society.  Giz Motor referred to it as today's fresh hell.  This new podcast from Zuckerberg.</p><p>And, by the way, when you're getting one up by the national security -- admit it, that national security agency, then you got a problem.  The NSA has asked the White House to abandon surveillance program where they were collecting information about U.S. phone calls and text messages.</p><p>Say, that the results, the benefits of it are outweighed by the burdens of keeping it running.  So, when NSA is one up in Facebook in terms of privacy, you've got a real problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  How about Tesla?  Lou, the company releasing disappointing first-quarter results.  Another loss, demands, for electric car slumping.  Company announcing it's launching a new insurance company as well.  The stock is down this morning.  What did you make of those numbers?</p><p>BASENESE:  Listen, I think it was a huge miss.  I mean, in January, Elon said that they were going to have a small profit, and then they had a huge $700 million loss.  There is more red flags here than communist parade, and they -- and they just keep coming up.</p><p>I mean, this week alone, we had four directors, you know, not standing for reelection, made some just exaggerated claims about full self-driving capabilities.  And then, now, where just is the -- you know, Elon issued guidance yesterday that just seemed unbelievable.</p><p>And then, also, I came out of the insurance industry earlier in my career.  That's not an easy industry to get into, it's a highly regulated.  And the fact that he thinks that they're just going to open up their own insurance carrier next year, I think it's wishful thinking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BASENESE:  It's more of a cash grab.  For -- and really, I think, that's it.  Overarching, there's two main concerns.  Do they have enough cash to keep the business going, and is there enough demand?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it sounds like he would sell the stock here.  I mean, it's been going down this week, it's a tough week.</p><p>It's at 258.66 right now.  Down two percent yesterday.  What do you want to do as an investor?</p><p>BASENESE:  Yes, you know, I'm bearish -- look, I actually have some bankruptcy put options, some cheap put options on the likelihood that they could run out of cash, and hit a crunch where they can't get financing.  I would definitely not be buying the stock in any debtors.  Too many concerns going on right now, long-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  Lou, great to get your insights.</p><p>BASENESE:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come back soon.  Lou Basenese, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Joe Biden is in.  The former vice president officially throwing his hat into the ring for 2020 presidential election.  We've got a lot coming up on that.  Donna Brazile, joining us to discuss.</p><p>Plus, Golden Archers for the golden years.  Details on McDonald's new partnership with AARP.  Right here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, it is official this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.  We will have much more on that coming up throughout the morning including an interview with DNC Chair Donna Brazile.  But first Martin Shkreli being moved from New Jersey to Brooklyn.  Cheryl Casone with details there, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  He's in Brooklyn.  That's right, Maria.  Shkreli had been confined to a federal prison in New Jersey but, yes, he's been moved to tougher lock-up in Brooklyn.  Don't mess with Brooklyn.  And claims he was using a smuggled cell phone to run his drug company from behind bars in New Jersey.  Shkreli's attorney called the move a formality; saying the disgraced pharmaceutical executive will eventually transfer to a federal facility in Pennsylvania.  Shkreli is serving a seven-year sentence for defrauding investors.</p><p>Well, Japan's Softbank investing a $125 million in an Alphabet unit that sends cellphone antennas very high into the atmosphere.  Loon is working to use the antennas to provide Internet in remote areas throughout the world.  Softbank says, it's an investment -- and Loon is part of a long-term strategic partnership.  Shares for Alphabet, a higher in the premarket.  Of course, this is the parent company of Google.  Higher by more than half-a-percent right now.</p><p>Well, Verizon announcing plans to expand 5G high-speed Internet service across the United States.  They have named 20 more cities where customers are going to get 5G this year.  the cities include: Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas and San Diego, Chicago and Indianapolis are the first to get 5G Verizon service.  and Verizon is also announcing preorders of Samsung's 5G smartphone start today in the United States.  We're going to take a closer look at all of this from Verizon.  Maria is going to be speaking exclusively to the president of Verizon Consumer Group at 8:20 a.m. Eastern Time this morning.</p><p>All right, well, some spend older years spending golf, Mitch Roschelle, or chess -- others want to spend time in McDonalds.  (INAUDIBLE) is teaming with AARP to provide job opportunities for older folks, that ranges from cashiers to managers.  The fast food giant looking to fill a quarter of a million jobs this summer.  Maria, a lot of this older folks lost a lot of their retirement savings in the great recession.  So, they have to work a little bit later in life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  Wait until you hear the bail agreement for Carlos Ghosn -- it's unreal.  We're going to have that when we come back.  We've got breaking news this morning: former Vice President Joe Biden is officially in, in the 2020 presidential race, much more ahead.  Plus, we are talking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazile -- she's weighing in.  We're watching earnings, of course, Starbucks, Ford Motor, Amazon on deck later today.  And then the state of oil and gas as the Trump administration cracks down on Iran -- what investors are looking for next, back in a minute with all of that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, we are waiting for the official release from prison of Carlos Ghosn, we'll get to that in a minute.  And Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race; we're going to have a lot more of that coming up this morning, including an interview with former DNC Chairman Donna Brazile.</p><p>First, the details about Carlos Ghosn.  He's not officially out yet but apparently as part of the bail agreement, sources are telling me that he will not be able to see or communicate with his wife, Carole.  They are telling her -- him that no phone calls, no meetings, the only time she will be able to communicate with him is through lawyers or with lawyers sometimes but they will be unable to communicate.  They're suggesting that she somehow will destroy evidence.  So, there's that in terms of the bail agreement for Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>We'll let you know when that is official.  Earning season very strong recently, certainly better than the low expectations.  Amazon, Ford, Starbucks all set to report later today.  Investors are also watching the price of oil and gas amid the Trump administration's crack-down on Iranian oil across world.  Joining us right now is Pacer ETF's Distributor President Sean O'hara.  Sean, great to see you again.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, DISTRIBUTOR PRESIDENT, PACER ETF:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has this impacted people's willingness to put money in stocks this earnings period?  What are you seeing right now?</p><p>O'HARA:  It's been a little slow in terms of flows into equities all year.  I mean, I watched the volume on some of the bigger ETFs as kind of bellwether to see what's going on -- if you look at IBV or SPY which are the biggest ETFs after the (INAUDIBLE).  The S&amp;P500 or the (INAUDIBLE) for example, that volume is about 60 to 70 percent of what it has been historically.  We talked to some trading firms and their volume is down, so it seems to me like what's going on with this market is that people are wanting to see more confirmation on good news and maybe earnings quarter coming in better than what folks had expected.  I mean, the next 75 percent of the companies in the S&amp;P report like the first 25 percent -- I think everybody would be really happy and maybe that's the catalyst that will get people moving back into the markets in a bigger way.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, we usually think about the market records, market highs has been going along with some sense of if not euphoria, at least extreme bullishness, but sounds like you're not really seeing that with this one?</p><p>O'HARA:  I don't think so.  And maybe it's because economic growth has been so slow for a decade.  It's been good and it's been positive and we haven't had recession but it hasn't been like out of control growth.  There's two percent growth during Obama administration and now, maybe three percent growth or slightly higher under President Trump, maybe that's what's keeping the euphoria out of this market.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Sean, we saw tech companies: Facebook, Microsoft beating a conglomerate today that missed.  Is there any spot in the -- across the S&amp;P 500 from a sector perspective that you're more word about from the earnings perspective?</p><p>O'HARA:  I think I'm more worried about individual names at this point.  I think the market -- we have decouple thinking from stock market as a whole and start focusing on individual names.  Like, for example, you saw Lamb Research report last night and had a good quarter.  But I think it was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Different than Texas instruments.</p><p>O'HARA:  Yes -- instruments, so they're both essentially in the same business and the same sector, but there's a difference in what's going on in the results.  Unfortunately, we own Lamb, we don't own T.I., that's what I think is going on and I think that's what's going to be the challenge for investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm really glad you mentioned semiconductors.  That's an important story right now.  We're going to talk with Michael (INAUDIBLE), he is the Chief Investment Strategist at major investment firm, Research.  We're going to talk with him coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: April 25, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 042502cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Joe Biden Announces 2020 Run; Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un Historic Summit; Bayer Faces Shareholder Showdown Over Monsanto; Venmo has Over 40 Million Users; Magic Johnson Quit Over e-mail; Pizza Hut Draft Special][Sect: News; Financial][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Cheryl Casone, Donna Brazile, Jared Max, Walid Phares][Guest: Mitch Roschelle, Alex Moazed, Doug Wead][Spec: Joe Biden; Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un; China;  Bayer; Monsanto; 3M; Venmo; Magic Johnson; e-mail; Pizza Hut; Draft; NBA; NFL; Amazon; Netflix; Friends; The Office; North Korea; Lakers; Democrat; President Donald Trump; Iran]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, April 25th.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning.</p><p>Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>We're talking with former DNC Chairman Donna Brazile this morning about what his candidacy means to the already crowded field of Democratic contenders this morning.</p><p>Plus earnings in focus, 3M with a miss on revenue and earnings, set to shave more than 100 points off the Dow Industrials right at the opening of trading this morning.</p><p>Southwest says that the grounding of the 737 contributed to a $200 million hit on revenue in the quarter.</p><p>We are waiting on Amazon and Starbucks and Ford, that happens after the bell tonight.  We have a preview.  Take a look, at 3m shares right now nine and two-thirds percent.  A big hit on the heels of that miss on revenue.</p><p>Southwest Airlines is up.  It's almost 3 percent on its numbers which were better than expected despite the hit from the 737.</p><p>Merger breakdown -- Deutsche Bank ending talks with Commerzbank, the merger between the two ailing banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution.</p><p>Markets this morning look like this.  Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  Dow Industrials now down 113 points as I said, largely due to 3M.  S&amp;P 500 is up, futures showing a gain there and the Nasdaq futures right now up 19 points, that's a quarter of a percent higher on Nasdaq.</p><p>Yesterday's markets were lower -- the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq finished down as you can see.</p><p>Microsoft and Disney though hit record highs.  The DowIndustrials were down 59 points, the S&amp;P down 6.5 and the Nasdaq down 18 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices this morning are lower.  FT 100 down 21 points, a third of a percent.  The CAC in Paris down 13, quarter of a percent.  Dax index in Germany lower by 17.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed story there.  You have the Bank of Japan saying it's not going to ease and its' not going to cut right now.  It's not going to raise either.  The Nikkei average as expected from the BOJ, the Nikkei average was up one of half of 1 percent.</p><p>Shanghai getting a hit.  Take a look at China.  The index there down two and-a-half percent overnight.  The Hang Seng and the Kospi also lower.</p><p>The Bank of Japan said that it will hold rates until -- at zero until the spring of 2020.  There is concern about slowing growth in Japan and reaching the 2 percent inflation objective as well.</p><p>Resignation revelation, Magic Johnson reportedly resigned from the Lakers after accidentally being copied on an e-mail about bad job performance -- his own.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and PWC partner Mitch Roschelle.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  It wouldn't be the first time somebody stumbled across an e-mail that they weren't supposed to get.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We've got to be careful when you're e-mailing people and who you cc on it.  Don't cc the subject.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes.  People are very careful in my office not to copy me, because they know it would hurt my feelings.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  You're so thin-skinned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news: Joe Biden is in.  And he's going to give his first interview to \"The View\".  Dagen -- what's that all about?  ?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So he is going to join \"The View\" tomorrow for his first interview since announcing that he's entering the 2020 presidential race.  And then Robin Roberts on Tuesday will have an interview with Joe and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden -- that.</p><p>So part of this is the relationship between -- Meghan McCain is one of the co-hosts on \"The View.  And Joe Biden -- Meghan tweeted back on April 1st that Joe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics.  He helped her through her father's cancer diagnosis.  Again -- Joe Biden's son, Bo, died of the same brain cancer, glioblastoma.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- through his treatment and ultimate passing.  \"More than any one of my father's friends combined I wish there was more empathy from our politicians, not less.\"</p><p>That kind of led to speculation -- there was a story going around yesterday that the McCain family was going to support Joe Biden trying to unseat President Trump.  Cindy McCain came out on Twitter yesterday and said \"Joe Biden is a wonderful man and dear friend of the McCain family.  However, I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics,\" said Cindy McCain.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I saw that tweet.  So look, we were expecting that Joe Biden enters the race and he did so on YouTube.  He launched his 2020 presidential campaign like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.</p><p>But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation -- who we are.  And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.</p><p>The core values of this nation are standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that made America, America is at stake.  That's why today I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now over the phone is former Democratic National Committee chairman and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile.  Donna -- always a pleasure to talk with you.  Thanks so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone):  Absolutely.  Look, this is a big deal.  Joe Biden is not only a proven leader but he is someone I think that will unify many Democrats, especially those who are center left.</p><p>I think he will bring much need assets to the field.  But this is not going to be a cake walk, Maria.  He has many candidates in the race already that's raising money and building up a very big grass roots operation.</p><p>So Joe Biden I think is talented and let's see if he can appeal to a younger generation of Democrats who may not be as familiar with his record.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Donna, let me ask you, what do you think he's talking about in that the video when he says we can't have Donald Trump in for eight years because he will forever alter the nation.  Is he talking about the fact that Donald Trump, should he win another four years, will name more Supreme Court justices?</p><p>BRAZILE: Well, that's part of the argument.  But I do believe that there's a large group of people in this country, especially in the Democratic Party, that believe that it's time for a different form of leadership.</p><p>They believe that the President is divisive, that he has not tried to unify the country.  He is basically focused on his base and not really worked to improve America's standing in the world.</p><p>So Joe Biden also said -- I just saw the video for the second time -- that it's time for respected leadership on the world stage, dignified leadership at home.  It is time for equal rights and equal justice.</p><p>So this is, again, a candidate who knows his way around Washington but also I believe his biggest challenge is to appeal to a different generation of Americans who may not be as familiar with his record.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Donna -- hi.  James Freeman here at the \"Wall Street Journal\".  Wondering about the issue of climate for Biden.  The premise of his candidacy it seems to me is that he can win blue collar voters in the industrial Midwest.  He has called climate the biggest threat we face.  But if he goes all the way to the GREEN NEW DEAL where the senators running for the Democratic nomination have gone, doesn't he alienate those blue collar voters?</p><p>BRAZILE:  Well, everyone knows that, you know, the Obama-Biden administration made a big push for the Paris accord.  They made a big push to make sure that we had a plan to begin the transition to renewable fuel and renewable energy.</p><p>So I don't think Joe Biden's record on climate will put him in any danger of reaching out to blue collar voters in the Midwest or in the sun belt.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Donna, good morning.  Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>President Obama referred to it as a circular firing squad.  How much Kevlar is Biden going to have to wear to avoid getting hit with shrapnel once the debates start.</p><p>BRAZILE:  well I mean, you know, He's the front runner.  As one of the frontrunners in the Democratic Party, many of the candidates will go after his record.  They will also try to point out that the American people are not interested in a third Obama, Biden term.  So I'm sure the vice president can handle all of the incumbents.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Donna, there was -- Maria brought this up earlier, Mike Emmanuel too at Fox News.  This is Dagen McDowell, by the way.  Made it clear that President Obama has said that he does not to endorse early in the primary process if at all in the primaries.  What do you make of that?  Seems a little bit odd.</p><p>BRAZILE:  No, I think that's a great move on his part.  Look, president Obama along with the former first lady has spent -- they've spent a lot of time trying to encourage young people to vote.  They have embarked on a campaign to help with the reapportionment and redistricting battles ahead.  I think they're going to continue to enlarge the electorate and convince a new generation of Americans to heed the call of leadership.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, the fact that it's his vice president and he's not going to be there, I mean, you've got a crowded field here, Donna.  And it's interesting to note, you know, that he's coming out as a moderate but largely the entire field is progressive, radical in many cases.  Is he going to be able to break through all the radicals?</p><p>BRAZILE:  Well, the only thing radical within the Democratic Party or the Republican Party are those that sit on the sidelines and not get involved.  These are people who --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh no, no, no.  No I'm talking about Bernie Sanders.  I'm talking about Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all.  I'm talking about Elizabeth Warren and her wealth tax.  I'm talking about AOC in the party, you know.  I'm talking about the radical ideas comings out of the Democratic Party right now -- Donna.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BRAZILE:  But these are ideas, I mean you are bringing forward ideas.  Yes.  But these are public policy ideas.  Raising the minimum wage, trying to find jobs for people who are still out there looking.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I'm talking about the Green New Deal and the Medicare for all, Donna.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Well, the cost of healthcare rising and more and more Americans spending their disposable income on healthcare, I mean, these are issues that people would like us to talk about.</p><p>I don't believe that we have all of the solutions, but you cannot allow these programs to go unaddressed.  Look, go back to Joe Biden.  Joe Biden has a wonderful opportunity because he is a proven leader, because he's run twice before.  He has high name recognition.</p><p>Can he raise the money?  Can he pull together a coalition?  Can he convince a new generation of Americans that he has a vision for the future?  And if he can, he will become the Democratic nominee.  But it's going to be a battle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially with Bernie Sanders raising all that money.  Bernie Sanders has been very successful.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right now --</p><p>BRAZILE:  People know Bernie.  They know Bernie, they know his record, they know what he stands for.  They know that he's an independent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRAZILE:  He caucuses with the Democrats. And he's the only self-identified Democratic socialist in the race.  But Joe Biden brings a different type of leadership, a different message.  But again, like many of the candidates of his generation, I think there's a hunger within the Democratic Party for new leadership and a new vision.</p><p>And that's one of his challenges.  But he will bring tremendous assets to the race.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Donna, really quickly -- it's Dagen again.  Bernie Sanders kind of got booed.  When he -- he name-dropped Dr. Martin Luther King at the \"she, the people\" summit said that I marched on Washington with Dr. King and he was feeling some heat from the crowd to the point he had to kind of hold up his finger, trying to get a word in.  What does that mean?  What did that say?</p><p>BRAZILE:  Because, you know, it's one thing to say I marched with Dr. back in 1963, 1965 -- whatever year you marched.  What are you doing now?  You know, it's an old song that Janet Jackson performed.  What have you done for us lately.  What are you doing now about criminal justice reform?  What are you doing now to bring jobs and opportunities to the inner city?  What are you doing now to build a new class of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well President Trump did actually did -- the President Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump did prison reform as well.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Well, look, President Trump has challenge as well.  But as you know, President Trump would spin it that he was down in Atlanta while Bernie was in Houston -- he was at a very important lead in on the opioid crisis.  Something else that we have to address as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Donna -- it's great to get your insights.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BRAZILE:  Look, forward to seeing you soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you too.  Donna Brazile joining us there.</p><p>Joe Biden becoming one of 12 vice presidents to seek the White House throughout history.  Some have been successful, others not so much.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE H.W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For seven and-a-half years I've helped the President conduct the most difficult job on earth.  Ronald Reagan asked for and received my candor.</p><p>Now you must see me for what I am, the Republican candidate for president of the United States.</p><p>AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For almost eight years now I've been the partner of a leader who moved us out of the valley of recession and into the longest period of prosperity in American history.  I say to you tonight, millions of Americans will remember for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was then vice presidents George H.W. Bush and Al Gore accepting their nominations for president back in 1988 and the year 2000.</p><p>One of those men, of course, was successful; the other was not.  Today another vice president enters the race.  Historically it might not be all easy for Joe Biden.Joining us right now is presidential historian Doug Wead.  Doug -- great to see you this morning.  Thanks for coming in.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>Your reaction this morning?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, you know, if you're betting in Las Vegas, 14 vice presidents have become presidents of the United States.  But as you said, it's very hard, only four were elected as sitting vice presidents and only one in all of history took a sabbatical like Joe Biden and then came back and won.  So it's going to be brutal, I'll put it that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What does he need to do to break through?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, he's got to distinguish himself from the others and he's going to have to run in the primaries, not the general.  George H.W. Bush 1985 started his campaign.  I tell you -- Maria, it looked like the highway was absolutely clear all the way to the presidency.  He had money, name recognition but almost didn't make it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Unbelievable.  Doug -- it's great to get your insights.  Thank you.</p><p>WEAD:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Doug Wead.</p><p>Coming up -- coming up next, merger collapse, Deutsche Bank ending talks with Commerzbank.  We've got the details after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We've got breaking news this morning.  It's official, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.  We've got a lot more coming up throughout the morning to look at that.</p><p>But first, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank scrap merger talks.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Big news breaking this morning -- Maria.  The Deutsche Bank/Commerzbank deal was expected to be announced as soon as tomorrow.  \"Wall Street Journal\" though is reporting that the agreement lacked investor support and it faced stiff opposition from labor unions.</p><p>The merger between the two struggling banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution.  And is no more.</p><p>Well, the measles outbreak in the U.S. surging to a 25-year high.  69 new cases reported.  The CDC in just this past weeks folks, this placed the number of cases to 695 across 22 save.  This is the worst tally since 1994.  The highest number of outbreaks is here in New York and also in Washington state.</p><p>Well, Amazon's Alexa under fire again over privacy worries.  Workers at the company can reportedly use location data to find users' home address through Alexa.</p><p>Enough incidents have been reported so far but Amazon says that quote, \"Access to internal tools is highly controlled and it's only granted to a limited number of employees who require these tools to train and improve the service for those users that like Alexa.</p><p>Amazon we should say, the big news going to report their latest earnings, that's after the bell today.  Ahead of all that, in the premarket -- Maria, the stock by a little more than 1 percent.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>James, what do you think about that?</p><p>FREEMAN:  You know this measles outbreak is just -- it's tragic.  It is -- people believing junk science, you've got to vaccinate.  This is a disease that was eradicated years ago.  Now it's back in the United States.  It can be fatal and it also destroys the immune system so that kids who get it can be vulnerable to other illnesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of misinformation about vaccines.  And that's the issue here.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And you know, these objections, they're not really religious objections in many cases.  But I think people have unfortunately -- I guess they're not believing medical authorities for some reason.  They're getting bad information from celebrities who have made this kind of a campaign.  You got to vaccinate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the problem is, this misinformation campaign by celebrities and the like has been going on for years about vaccinations.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now you see the results of basically preaching these individuals with a little bit of name recognition, preaching magic at people and just preaching lies and now it's kind of gotten away from the entire nation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've got to jump we've got to jump.  Biden's White House bid is up next.  The former vice president adding his name to the crowded Democratic field.</p><p>Plus Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers. Wait until you see what happened.  Reportedly he wasp copied accidentally on an e-mail about his bad performance.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Earnings in focus this morning, Facebook reporting first quarter results, beating on both earnings per share and revenue.  The company attributing the strong numbers to growth in stories, users and ads.  The stock is up almost 9 percent right now.</p><p>Microsoft posted a double beat last night as well, the company moving past a trillion dollar market value.  The market cap above a trillion dollars with the most recent move up, up 5 percent this morning.</p><p>This is a third of these major tech companies to hit the valuation of a trillion dollars after Apple and Amazon.  Amazon releasing hits first quarter numbers later this afternoon, right after the close.</p><p>Joining us right now is Applico CEO, Alex Moazed and joining us right now.  Alex -- good to see you.</p><p>ALEX MOAZED, APPLICO CEO:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  But first sort of assess the field for us in terms of these tech companies.  What was your reaction to all the earnings that we saw.</p><p>MOAZED:  We're really just getting started with big tech.  These tech monopolies like Microsoft and Facebook, could be earnings and that's just the beginning.  And I predict that Amazon is also going to beat quite aggressively.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes but we were tough on her earlier.  I mean the business model of selling data to the advertising companies.  I mean this breach of privacy that we see over and over again.</p><p>Is this just a state of the business model.  Do you really want to own a stock if you see these kinds of pressure on the companies business model?</p><p>MOAZED:  You know, the funny thing is privacy actually helps them and supports them to actually have a more dominant role if we look at what GDPR has done to Factbook and Google in the E.U.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Are they able to grow users and do they need users to grow and do privacy concerns sort of stunt user growth?</p><p>MOAZED:  Privacy concerns get this legislation going.  That actually prevents the competition from Facebook and Google, from competing with them.  So GDPR put all these rules and fines into place and Facebook and Google are in the best position to comply with those rules, post GDPR, Facebook and google have a more dominant share of digital advertising as a result.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So the fundamentals of their business may not be changing but they're freezing out competition.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until Elizabeth Warren comes along and breaks the company up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if she breaks them up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the theory is that they're kind of dominant monopolies and that there's not a market place competitor able to displace them which I think is your view as well.</p><p>MOAZED:  Yes.  and that's where -- that's really the vulnerability That's really the vulnerability, to your point right, is really the anti-trust regulation that these businesses are monopolies.  But the question is, how do they compete with their supply and that's where they get into trouble.  How are they regulating supply?  How are they regulating the sellers on Amazon or the content creators on Facebook or Twitter.  That's really where they're vulnerable.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But you look at the history of tech.  AOL was thought to dominate online consumer activity.  Yahoo at one time dominating the search business.  Competition tends to come out of nowhere more quickly than we expect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good point there.</p><p>MOAZED:  There is a lot of competition amongst the big tech monopolies.  They do compete quite aggressively.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not for google, they have 90 percent market share in search.</p><p>MOAZED:  Google has -- yes magically somehow those numbers are under 70 percent but Google absolutely has a monopoly on search.  They have a monopoly on content if you look in YouTube.  And they're just getting started.  There's huge growth in front of these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying it's 70 percent, not 90 percent.</p><p>MOAZED:  They will report under 70 percent.  But if you look internationally it's always over 70 percent.  It's funny how those numbers work out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They don't want to show that it's dominant.</p><p>MOAZED:  Yes.  That would create some problems.  But when it comes to their suppliers, that's really where this can be a problem for them, especially as we look towards, say, the elections next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what Applico does.</p><p>MOAZED:  Applico helps these old, traditional incumbents say I need to compete against big tech, big tech has these new business models, I should build or buy this new business model because this is the inevitable future state of my industry.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So you help an old analog business become more digital.</p><p>MOAZED:  Yes, by essentially reinventing themselves.  Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, they have the new business model.  Why aren't the traditional companies trying to adopt the new as opposed to the new tech trying to go into the old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like geo tagging, you got your McDonald's app with your location on, you drive by McDonald's, it will let you know, we'll have your favorite quarter pounder with cheese and large fry ready for you, you can just hit a button, order it and pull through the drive-through and they have it ready for you.  That's traditional business doing something right.</p><p>MOAZED:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, that's the golden arches in golden years I was hoping for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not the AARP.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You want the drone delivering your food to you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MOAZED:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which by the way, that wing, that division of Google, got that approval in Blacksburg, Virginia to do and they're working with the community to figure out what they can delivering to people in this rural area of Virginia.  It's sort overall might want.</p><p>I think that I mean that opens the door to something all together different in this country.</p><p>MOAZED:  And I think we're going to see later today Amazon also beat earnings.  I actually don't think they're just going to beat earnings this quarter, they're probably going to beat earnings next quarter and probably the quarter thereafter.  We're really just in the beginning phase of seeing how these big tech monopolies are really getting into their strides.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the biggest growth story within this space right now?</p><p>MOAZED:  I think Amazon, you know.  Just in the past year they turned on the revenues from advertising on the marketplace, but they have multiple other platform businesses coming behind that.  B2B distribution is three times the size of consumer retail, it's a $6-8 trillion market.  Consumer retails to a half trillion.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Is that U.S. certain level?</p><p>MOAZED:  That's just in the United States, 2.5 trillion is in the U.S. consumer retail.  B2B distribution is two to three times the size.  And they only have $10 billion in GMB.</p><p>So, they have so many things that the core monopoly marketplace is throwing off a lot of cash for these other things that are rising fast as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're expecting a really good quarters for that from Amazon.</p><p>MOAZED:  I think Amazon is going to do very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  Alex, it's great to see you.</p><p>MOAZED:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Alex Moazed, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, breaking news this morning, Joe Biden officially enters the 2020 race.  We're bringing you the very latest on this entry and what it means for the field.</p><p>Plus, the latest nuclear negotiations as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet face-to-face for the first time, the details, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, April 25th.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race officially.  Former Trump campaign foreign policy affairs expert Walid Phares is with us.  He will weigh in on that, coming up.</p><p>Earnings certainly the big focus for Wall Street.  Take a look at 3M with a miss on revenue and earnings, the stock is down eight percent right now.  That is set to shave about a hundred points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average right at the open.</p><p>Southwest is surging, it had a double beat on earnings and revenue.  The stock is up 2-1/3 percent on Southwest.</p><p>Tonight we are hearing from Amazon, Ford Motor and Starbucks right after the bell.  Amazon could be a market mover for tech.  We will be previewing that coming up.</p><p>Markets however are feeling the heat of 3M, look at the Dow Industrials right now, down 93 points.  We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow as Futures will indicate because of 3M.  But the other major indices are actually up.  S&amp;P Futures are up almost one point and the NASDAQ Futures right now up 18 points, that's a quarter of a percent.</p><p>After yesterday's close where the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ at one point in the session hit record highs, but then retreated by the close.  The Dow Industrials down 59 point, the S&amp;P 500 down 6-1/2 and the NASDAQ down 18 points at the close.</p><p>In Europe this morning the indices look like this, and it is lower across the board.  FT-100 down 41 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris down 13 and the DAX Index in Germany down 15 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the -- well, the big news was the GDP in South Korea, it was weaker than expected.  As you can see, the Korean Kospi Index was down one-half a percent.  Japan was up about a half a percent, the Bank of Japan said that it is keeping extremely low interest rates where they are until at least the spring of 2020, pretty much expected that the BOJ wasn't going to do anything.</p><p>We've got streaming wars that viewers love watching reruns on Netflix.  But some popular shows could be pulled.  Which of your favorite shows could go away and not be on Netflix.  We're going to tell you.</p><p>Plus, resignation revelations, check this out, Magic Johnson reportedly resigning from the Lakers after accidentally being copied on an e-mail about his bad job performance.  All those stories coming up.</p><p>But first, the breaking news of the morning and that is Joe Biden made it official, entering the 2020 presidential race.  Joining an already crowded Democratic field.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor, Fox News national security and foreign affairs expert, Walid Phares.  And great to see you, Walid.  Thanks very much for weighing in here.</p><p>WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Joe Biden.</p><p>PHARES:  Well, that was expected by most observers, that the most senior politician in the Democratic Party, the former vice president is in the best position in view of his advisors and the supporters to be the leading candidates of that field.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significant a challenge is this to Donald Trump?</p><p>PHARES:  Probably this is the best shot that the Democratic party would have, because Biden is experienced.  He was for eight years in the White House and all is going to rest now with his team, who is he going to have as a teammate, who is going to be the vice presidential candidate would be the bigger question.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Walid, hi, James Freeman here with the Wall Street Journal.  How would a Biden foreign policy differ from the Trump foreign policy?</p><p>PHARES:  Oh, it will be completely different.  It will be a return to the Obama administration policies, including let's begin with Iran deal, a return to the Iran deal, a different policy with China.  I am not sure what they're going to do with North Korea now that Chairman Kim is meeting with Putin.  That's changing a lot of the chess game going on.  So, we're going to see -- we're going to see a very clear difference between a Biden platform and a Trump platform.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Walid, good morning, Mitch Roschelle.  You mentioned the China deal and I think we've talked about on the air Chinese are slow-playing the Trump administration in hopes that he doesn't win re-election and they don't have to sort of make the deal that's on the table.</p><p>How do you think China would potentially handicap a Biden administration and how could that influence potentially the remainder of the Trump first term from a negotiating with China perspective?</p><p>PHARES:  Well, your angle is very interesting because it applies not only to China but to Iran and many other players who are under pressure by the Trump administration.  China is the biggest actor who's under pressure -- who are under pressure to get a new deal in terms of finances, in terms of economy.  And China is playing all the cards including as I said earlier, Chairman Kim now meeting with President Putin.  I believe China is behind that.  So that it's not dealing with this issue and now it's opening a new chapter so far that president Putin will be the one who will bring back Kim to the table of negotiations.</p><p>So I believe as you said that the next year and-a-half are going to be attempts by many international players to gain time, hoping that there will be no second presidency for President Trump but they may fail.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The meeting -- the meeting between -- it's Dagen McDowell, Walid.  The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, how is that not a black eye for the Trump administration and what's been going on with our two less than successful summits with North Korea?</p><p>PHARES:  I think Chairman Kim meeting with Putin is in preparation and repositioning to speak with our president, with President Trump.  That's what he's trying to do.</p><p>Chapter one failed.  I mean, it all began when Kim fired those missiles, expecting that as was the case before, a Trump administration is going to go and negotiate and accept some sort of aid.  It did not work.</p><p>President Trump tweeted first and then sent task forces.  North Korean leaders ran to China and China told them you have to talk with the United States, and we saw what we saw.  I mean, he was gratified that he has been at the high visibility.  But when the time came and Trump asked him to deliver on nukes, he couldn't.  So now he's going to Putin.</p><p>And Putin, it's very good for him because he's going to reposition himself to speak with President Trump after two years of -- you know, impossibilities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's China.  The White House announcing that U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin are headed back to Beijing next week.  They're going to go on the 30th to resume talks.</p><p>First, your thoughts on that.  Are we going to see a deal?  And what do you think Biden's policy platform will be?  Will he take on China the way the president has?</p><p>PHARES:  He is going in my view to be tougher on China but in reality they're going to negotiate with China from a weaker position.  The Trump administration is stronger in terms of narrative but they will try to cut a deal with China and China understands that now they have two partners that they're going to be dealing with this, a sitting president and a strong candidate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, do you think Biden has articulated his strategy yet?  What is it?  I mean, or is it go -- I mean, is it going to be anything more than take down Trump?</p><p>PHARES:  It's going to be first of all a strong primary.  He's going to distinguish himself on foreign policy from everybody else.  He's going to tell them, look, I have been vice-president for eight years, I know better on China, on Iran, on Russia and everything else, to win that first battle.</p><p>The second battle he's going to say, well, look, Trump has not yet given any results in terms of negotiating with China, what is the result, negotiating with Kim, what is the result, what is he doing on Iran.  These would be the criticisms that will be used by vice president -- former vice president Biden against our president now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that makes a lot of sense.  Walid, great to have your insights.  Thank you so much.</p><p>PHARES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Walid Phares, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Biden's White House bid.  The former vice president adding his name to the crowded Democratic field.  We're going to bring you the very latest on his entry into the 2020 race with analysis.</p><p>Then, Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers explained.  He was reportedly copied on e-mails about his bad job performance, that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, it is official this morning, Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race.  We have a lot more coming up on that throughout the morning.  But first, Bayer facing a showdown with shareholders over Monsanto this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details there in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, I guess some corporate wars going this morning, Maria.  Bayer shares are actually rising overseas, better than expected results, giving that company a brief respite ahead of tomorrow's potentially very unruly and unpleasant shareholder meeting.  Investors are growing impatient with the company's legal problems here in the United States.  The German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company reported an above expected rise in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and sales, driven mostly by the integration of Monsanto which it acquired for $63 billion last year.  So, expect fireworks there.</p><p>OK, Venmo gaining some popularity.  More than 40 million people use the mobile payment app over the past 12 months.  That is more users than top U.S. banks have on their apps like Bank of America, even Wells Fargo.  Total payments on Venmo jumped by more than 70 percent to $21 billion just in the first quarter.</p><p>Now, PayPal which owns Venmo released these details as part of its quarterly earnings that came in after the bell.  Premarket post earnings, PayPal is up almost two percent as you can see on your screen.</p><p>And then another stock to watch could be Netflix.  They might have to say good-bye to some of their most popular shows.  Wall Street Journal is reporting that as companies like Warner Media and NBC Universal are looking to start their own streaming services, they're going to want their programs back and one of them, yes, you can see it on your screen is \"Friends\", it's one of the most popular hits on Netflix, believe it or not.  \"The Office\", another show, people love to stream on Netflix.  Right now Netflix slightly higher in the premarket.  Don't take my \"Friends\" away, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big deal.  I mean, they're paying all this money and investing so much -- you know, so many billions in original content.</p><p>CASONE:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But people want things like --</p><p>CASONE:  They want \"Friends\", yes, they want the old -- the old good stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But now there's multiple platforms that you can stream on, the content -- we said it a million times, content is key but having forcing people to have multiple subscriptions so that they can get all of the content that they want, so you can't get some of the HBO content on this platform.  You have to also subscribe to them.  I think that's going to be the way the game is played.  You're going to have to have multiple monthly bills to get all the content you want.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  HBO now is going to have problems with \"Game of Thrones\" going away.  The \"Deadwood\" movie comes out I think next month.  And then after that, then what?  Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not paying for that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Curb.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, curb your enthusiasm.  That's really worth whatever bazillion dollars a year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, I wonder, I mean, you look at a company like Netflix, if they're going to lose some of the more important things, I mean, will you going to pay up for that?  Probably you will (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't watch \"Friends\" reruns or even in \"The Office\" reruns.  I watch --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want the original content?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't -- yes, I don't watch \"Friends\".  I really -- again, I've lived in New York City for 25 years.  I know no apartment that looks like that every episode (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And no coffee shop looks like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.  And then to \"The Office\", it's all about the original office with Ricky Gervais, not the American version.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, just Netflix has been spending a lot of money to develop new content.  And I think they're still not quite there.  This is -- this is what it suggests to me is that they still need me to buy the rights to those Hollywood creation as opposed to their new stuff which a -- although they -- there is a good documentary if you get a chance, \"Battered Bastards Of Baseball\", it's about the actor Kurt Russell and his dad creating a minor league baseball team in the '70s.  Fascinating story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kurt Russell has been doing a lot.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it's a -- it's really -- it's an amazing story, it's sort of an American entrepreneurial story of a guy kind of challenging the baseball establishment.  It's really, really fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've got a recommendation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there's nobody more awesome than Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're so wonderful.  I love them both.  It's true.</p><p>Coming up, Magic Johnson's shocking exit from the Lakers explained, he was reportedly copied on e-mails about his bad job performance.  The story is next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So we've been telling you all morning an e-mail mistake may have led to Magic Johnson abruptly resigning from the Lakers.  Jared Max with details now in sports.  Jared, Good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  According to NBA analyst, Rick Bucher  of FS1, Magic Johnson's abrupt resignation as Lakers' president two weeks back may have been sparked by something that Magic read.  Bucher tells FS1's Colin Cowherd that to his understanding, Magic was C.C.ed or blind C.C.ed on e-mails between the Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and Lakers G.M. Rob Pelinka, e-mails that Bucher said Pelinka was critical of the Lakers legend who did not appear to get offended by Jeanie Buss.</p><p>The question, have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?  Of the first 32 NBA Playoff games, 27 have drawn lower T.V. ratings than one year ago, 24 with multiyear lows according to Sports Media Watch.</p><p>Last night, the Clippers upset the Warriors despite 45 points from Kevin Durant.  They force game six in L.A. and the winner will face the Rockets who eliminated the Jazz.</p><p>Tonight is the night football fans the first round of the NFL draft.  Heisman trophy winner, Kyler Murray figures to be the number one selection.  He gave up his baseball career in the contract with the Oakland A's to play in the NFL.  The Arizona Cardinals have the first pick, and then it's the 49ers, the Jets, Raiders, Buccaneers and the Giants who pick sixth.  And again, 17th the pick they got for trading Odell Beckham Jr.</p><p>Pizza Hut an NFL draft sponsor, Pizza Hut's offering 50 percent off pizza through Saturday, April 27th.  here's the catch, once the first draft pick gets made, 08:00 Eastern tonight, you have to go to the Pizza Hut social media, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and you get the special code that's needed for the half price pizza.</p><p>Did you watch \"Jeopardy\" last night?  Sports better James Holshouser did it again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You add 24,000 today, it's not a record, it's only 73 only $73,621 and now a 15 day total of $1,135,175.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  A lifelong Chicago Bears fan James Holshouser last night saluted his favorite team.  He use the Chicago Bears logo to kind of create an E in his own name.  there's always a shout out.  And he's on pace to just blow away Ken Jennings' record.  It took like 70 something shows to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, that's cool.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, did Pelinka and Buss know that Magic had seen the e-mail?</p><p>MAX:  I think we're going to find out more and more about this.  We might need an actual investigation and a whole report to find out you know, when it all --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it seems like a tough business.  Like most businesses if this happened it would be we're so sorry, we didn't mean it, please stay and --</p><p>MAX:  And Magic I think thought that he had Jeanie Buss on his side.  You know, from Jerry Buss the longtime owner.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they have known each other for about four decades.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Jeanie well hired her own real blood brother and hired Magic Johnson who she called her brother, that's how close they were.  And it was Magic Johnson that hired Rob Polinka, Kobe Bryant's former agent who was, well, laughed at by many people in terms of some of the like -- some of the things he said and some of the player decisions that he made.  So I --</p><p>MAX:  Small, small, world.  Small business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to be careful when you're e-mailing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't do business with your family is what I would say.  Whether they're fans family by birth or family by choice.</p><p>MAX:  NFL draft really fun to watch the first round.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tonight.</p><p>MAX:  The truth is, most over-hyped event in sports.  Tom Brady was a sixth round draft pick.  And some of the best football players in history weren't even drafted.  It's just to see who's going in.  It's fun, period.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny to see how the like NFL does it versus you know, Fox or -- you know, I mean, when you look at the NFL draft on the NFL network, it just it's like exactly like the pump and circumstance that you would see in the major networks.  I just think it's interesting what the NFL network is doing.</p><p>MAX:  What's bigger than the NFL?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MAX:  Right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared, thanks.

Then earnings in focus, 3M had a miss in revenue.

The stock is up two and a third percent on Southwest.  Later on today, we will hear from Amazon, Ford Motors, and Starbucks, that happens after the bell tonight.  Markets are mixed, take a look at futures, Dow futures are lower because of 3M largely.</p><p>The Dow is expected to be down about 90 points at the start of trading all of which is being attributed to 3M, a third of a percent lower.

The former Nissan chief granted bail.  The strict restrictions he faces upon release coming up.  Merger breakdown, Deutsche Bank ending talks with Commerzbank, the merger between the two ailing banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning, and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle.  Great show so far guys.  Lot of breaking news.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWCUS:  You couldn't have more breaking news although in the next hour you never know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we might.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  And just amazing this slow growth around the world we've been talking a lot about Europe.  Now, you see South Korea underperforming.  Canada is weak.  But the U.S., it looks like we'll find out what the GDP report tomorrow better than expected growth a strong dollar and U.S. remains kind of this island of vitality in the world economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But how long before the conversation and the concerns among investors shift back to a fed that's poise to raise interest rates because right now you see one that's pausing.  And that's one concern that a lot of people have raised just like when do we start wringing our hands about a hawkish fed more than one that's kind of put tap the breaks at the moment?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see what they say next week.  We got a Federal Reserve FOMC Meeting is Wednesday, May 1st.  Also by the way, the China talks are resuming when Mnuchin and Lighthizer go to Beijing on the 30th.  That's also happening next week.  You got the U.S. jobs' report coming out for the month of April at the end of next week on Friday.

We are covering breaking news this morning.  Former Vice President Joe Biden making it official, he is running for president.  Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the reaction and more details.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  He just might be the very last Democrat to jump into the race.  But polls also show at least for the moment he is the front-runner in the Democratic primary.  Joe Biden announcing earlier this morning his run for president in a video that he released in which he focused on the August 2017 protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>The former vice president singling out part of President Trump's initial response when the president said there were, \"Very fine people on both sides.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Those words, the President of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.  And then at that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the Democrats 2016 nominee continues to speak out on the obstruction case laid out in the Mueller report.  Hillary Clinton writing in a Washington Post op-ed that Democrats shouldn't necessarily immediately rush to judgment.  She writes, \"Congress should hold substantive hearings that build on the Mueller report and fill in its gaps, not jump straight to an up or down vote on impeachment.  In 1998, the Republican-led House rushed to judgment.  That was a mistake then and would be a mistake now.\"</p><p>Maria, Clinton also says that there should be a bipartisan independent commission to study election interference to study protecting our elections much like there was a bipartisan independent commission that was setup after 9/11, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Black, thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning.  The president just tweeted on the Mueller investigation.  Here's what President Trump just said as has been incorrectly reported by the fake news media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller even though I had the legal right to do so.  If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn't need McGahn to do it.  I could have done it myself.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I and many others say was an illegal investigation.  There was no crime, headed by a Trump hater who was highly being conflicted and a group of 18 very angry Democrats.  Drain the swamp writes the president.  Joining us right now is The Daily Caller Editor-in-chief Christopher Bedford.  Chris, lots of talk about with you today.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHRIS BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, first your reaction to Biden entering the race.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, it seems like a little bit of a box roll out.  There was a lot of different talk of one it was going to come this week.  He was going to be in Pennsylvania.  He was going to be live event and then -- and then there was talk that the original video that they had planned was scrambled and changed, and leaks this early in your campaign should serve to get people excited, not serve to set expectations that you don't meet.</p><p>But Biden is to clear front runner and people keep on saying, well, once they get a view of him, the left won't like him, but they've had a view of him for eight years.  He's a popular figure in the Democratic Party.  He hasn't won before on the national stage.  But if he can raise his money and get ahead of the Beto's, and the Buttigieg's, and all the other people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about Bernie?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And Bernie, Bernie is the main one.  He's his main competitor.  If he can raise money and not be embarrass in his first few weeks and he's off to a salt start.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But some of the rhetoric from the left that has many of the senators leaning more left than they had been when they ran for their respective offices, do you think Biden can sort of drag the party more to the center in this process or do you think the noise in the left is just going to be unquenchable?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think the noise from the left in a primary is going to be unquenchable, or a Democratic president Biden could probably shift the Democratic Party more to the center.  That's where a lot of the voters are.  That's where a lot of the freshmen class are.  But in the primaries, never the time to take on the most active in your base and that's what he's up against.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know Nancy Pelosi, this is her pick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The -- but the thing is the people who are the most vocal in the media are left wing liberals, and people on Twitter and on social media.  But if you look at the Democratic base based on some polling half of those individuals identify them as conservative Democrats.  So again, he appeals to -- he appeals to that and he's coming into this may be just on pure name recognition with a 6.3-point lead over Bernie Sanders and real clear politics average of polls right now.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And the media has put their fingers so hard on the scale for this one.  The left wing -- I mean who is Buttigieg?  That's a make-believe media candidate that now is getting all these stories out about him saying who is this guy?  Well, we know who it is because you invented him or why is Gillibrand not the first major female candidate, but Kamala Harris is.  They've been picking winners and losers like every single day of the week --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I want to know still why Obama and Michelle are saying we're going to sit it out.  We're not going to get behind a candidate.  I mean this is his vice president and President Obama is saying, I don't know who I'm voting for yet.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I don't think they're typical Democratic politics.  It's not like the Clinton politics of the machine.  It's more Obama has got a vision for how he wants to see America, and what a lot of people would call radical.  Although, Democrats nowadays have moved further to the left than his, and Joe Biden is not the exemplar of that -- of that mission --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  So -- yes.  OK.  So he had to come out and say something.  Go ahead, James.  Sorry.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I just wonder you seem to be criticizing Mayor Buttigieg, is that because the economy of South Bend is not quite the economy of Mishawaka or Elkhart?  I mean if he's -- let's say his got -- he's presiding over the -- one of the top five economies in North CentralIndiana.  Some would say that's reason enough to run for president.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, a dog catcher could run for president these days.  But what blows me away about --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, quite frankly a reality show star did, so let's be clear about that.  Right.  Exactly.  So you joke about Buttigieg --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has major -- I will tell you this.  I've had private conversations about Mayor Pete.  He has major game and it's not manufactured by the media.  It is who he is.  He's a husband and Mayor Pete and (INAUDIBLE) who is his basically communications manager.  They know how to use --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They know how to use --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, his communications is a former  Eliot Spitzer (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They know how to use social media.  I will say that.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And they reach out and the first time I ever heard his name was in an article saying, yes, he is running.  And then we heard more and more and more being ginned up.  This guy speaks so many languages.  He learns languages to read books.  He's such a great mayor and it's just -- he's not nearly at the level that previous people who have run successful campaigns for president.  Although, to all your points when he reaches 10 points nationally, I'm losing a steak dinner bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they're already --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're already digging -- his Democratic opponents are already spending a lot of money apparently and trying to dig up dirt on him, number one.  And, number two, I -- just caution you because we joke -- you joke about Mayor Pete publicly and privately.  That's the same kind of stuff that people said about President Trump with President Trump where they dismissed him dismissed him and dismissed him --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BEDFORD:  An international man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was.  But, again, I think that millennial voters have a connect -- build connections with people via social media that anybody over the age of -- even in my age bracket over the age of 40 don't understand because they're not paying attention, so I just cautioned you about joking because again he's a --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Also, I would caution the Democrats not to rule out the Mayor of Fort Wayne because that's been growing population a little bit faster than South Bend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears.  I got to get your take on (INAUDIBLE) you just want to respond to that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No, I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  New details in the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, the Washington Examiner among others are reporting that a former FBI official says that a cache of Clinton's e-mails were discovered in the Obama White House.  This comes as the Justice Department is looking into possible misconduct by the Obama administration officials and then undermining the 2016 Trump campaign.  We know that Lindsey Graham, that William Barr, and of course the I.G. are looking at the origins of that FBI investigation into Trump, and they didn't do anything and investigate Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The e-mails disappeared and now they were found in the Obama White House, your reaction.</p><p>BEDFORD:  We had some indication that the president had been when he was in office e-mailing back and forth to Hillary Clinton from her private server and now paying attention was sort of what a spokesman said.  But now, we have absolute confirmation that the FBI actually had to dig up these e-mails and find them when everyone said that they were lost.  And everywhere else the rift are found is a long list of Clinton aides and tech aids and then a law firm.</p><p>But then -- and then the Obama White House and the Secret Service, so one of these things is not like the other things, and I'd like to see how many e-mails there were and it will be hard to find that, but what's in them?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to be hard because I don't think there's a willingness to go here.</p><p>BEDFORD:  There's none.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It's amazing how huge these stories, huge government stories and somehow the president at the time is just kind of this figure off stage making occasional cameo appearance.  I mean it's the same thing with the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign, are we going to learn (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've written about this.  James has written a couple of op-eds about this that we -- it's time to hear from the Obama administration.  Where did -- where did the direction come -- where did the directive come from?  Was it the Obama White House to investigate Donald Trump and spy on his campaign during the 2016 election?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Imagine if President Obama was being as helpful to Joe Biden as he was to Hillary Clinton.  I've never seen a president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BEDFORD:  Imagine -- I've never heard of a president who did so much to sabotage the incoming administration as President Obama did and to protect his nominee.  Of course, it's just some party politics at play here.  But I'm wondering if Lindsey Graham is going to be able to get to the bottom of all of where this investigation really started and who is implicated in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We Know Devin Nunes has sent over those eight criminal referrals and apparently they are expecting once the I.G. report comes out there will be more criminal referrals in that I.G. report --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it will fall on Bill Barr, the attorney general to act on those criminal referrals.  And that's why he's being targeted by the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.  All right.  Christopher, great to see you.  BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Chris Bedford there.  Coming up, earning season in full swing now.  Heavy hitters like 3M, Southwest, and Comcast all reporting their quarterly numbers this morning.  3M is down eight percent.  It is on track to cut about 112 points from the Dow Industrials at the opening bell.  That's why the Dow is negative right now.  March durable goods out in 20 minutes' time.  We're going to get another window into how the economy is doing.</p><p>We're looking for an increase of eight-tenths of a percent on durable goods for the month of March.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another jam-packed day with earning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details.  3M really making a mark this morning, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, that's right, Maria.  3M, a double miss for that company.  They've lowered their 2019 forecast.  EPS at 2.23 versus expectations of 2.49 revenue at 7.86 billion.  They're about to shave a hundred points off the Dow when we come to the open.  Big news there.  Southwest earnings though much better, a double beat here.  Take a look.  2.23, that's adjusted EPS expectations were very different indeed, so 70 cents a share versus 61, apologies there.</p><p>So what's interesting about this though, they had a better quarter despite grounding 10,000 737 MAX flights, so big quarter for them.  The stock is up premarket.  Amazon coming after the bell.  We're expecting a very big quarter for Amazon with earnings of $4.92 a share.  It's all about cloud services.  Facebook last night had a double beat.  The stock up after hours and up now 8.5 percent.  They set aside three billion dollars to pay the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Microsoft, the double beat up, five percent strong cloud revenue growth quarterly gaining growth as well.  And Tesla, big miss, the stock down three quarters of a percent this morning.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Gerri, thank you so much, Gerri Willis.  Coming up, Verizon's big announcement on the 5G revolution.  That is next.  Plus, March durable goods out due in 10 minutes.  We've got the numbers for you.  Economists are looking for an eight-tenths of a percent increase there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news this morning, former Vice President Joe Biden officially entering the 2020 presidential race.  But first, the 5G revolution, Verizon announcing this morning 20 cities across the U.S. will get its 5G ultra wide band network this year including Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Washington, D.C.  Preorders for the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G also kicking off today.  Joining us right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the president of Verizon consumer group, Ronan Dunne.  Great to see you, Ronan.  Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>RONAN DUNNE, PRESIDENT, VERIZON CONSUMER GROUP:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're all talking about 5G and the implications there.  First, do you think that we are going to see the 5G network materialize this year because I know there's a lot of conversation about it but so far, we haven't really seen, you know, details of evidence that in fact this is happening that soon?</p><p>DUNNE:  So, Maria, we've already launched our first two cities last week in Minneapolis, and Chicago, and this morning, we've announced the next 20, and that's part of a commitment to make sure that at least 30 major cities across the U.S. have a 5G experience this year.  So 5G is real and 5G is already arrived in the U.S.  And, today, we're also announcing the fact that we've got a great new Samsung S10 5G smartphone, so more of our customers will be able to enjoy an amazing 5G experience on the world's best smartphone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you give us the sense of what kind of changes we'll see as a result of 5G?  What does that mean to people with this phone?</p><p>DUNNE:  So I think a couple of things.  First thing to say is that this phone will also make the most of the U.S.' best 4G LTE network.  So wherever you are, this is a great phone.  But you also get the benefit of an increasing number of cities that have 5G and really when you think about 5G I would say it's moving to real time.  It's about real-time forecast streaming.  It's about real-time video gaming.  It's about an individual being able to trade on their smartphone as fast as one of those Wall Street traders you talk too.  That's living life in real time.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Ronan, Mitch Roschelle, good morning.  One of the things and by the way thanks for the tie shout out on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUNNE:  Good morning, Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But one of the things that's interesting about 5G is that it does enable the internet of things or IOT to take place and in that realm, there are a lot of concerns about data privacy, are you baking anything to guard against data privacy in the 5G rollout?</p><p>DUNNE:  So the first thing to understand is actually your cellular network are the most secure way to transfer data.  So actually, from a privacy point of view, we start from a great position because the technology supports that and we're very conscious as Verizon.  We're very committed to making sure that we recognize it's our consumers' data and should only be used in the way they consent to use it.  So we're absolutely building in security right at the core, and the more of your traffic that goes over a wireless network, the more secure your data is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me just break in, Ronan, and tell you that we do have breaking news right now.  President Trump just tweeted on Joe Biden entering the presidential race and the president just says welcome to the race, Sleepy Joe.  I only hope you have the intelligence long in doubt to wage a successful primary campaign.  It will be nasty you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick and demented ideas.  But if you make it, I will see you at the starting gate.</p><p>Wow, writes President Trump this morning about Joe Biden entering the race.  Your -- before we get back to Ronan, what's your reaction here?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of Vice President Biden's hurdles will be to not seem sleepy and meaning not seem like his heart isn't in it.  And that I think that with -- remember, low energy Jeb.  Jeb act -- Jeb Bush acted like he didn't want to be there and he didn't have the energy for the long haul.  I think that Vice President Biden has to fight back --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the end -- by the end of four years, what?  Biden will be 80?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and I'm not even talking about his age.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean I'm wondering if that's what the president is trying to suggest.  I mean the president is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's -- his -- they're close enough in age.  That wouldn't be throwing stones about some --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump has.  I mean he's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But it's more of the -- I think that do you want this?  Do you want to do this?  Do you have it in your heart at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will -- Ronan Dunne, thank you so much, sir.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  We are awaiting March Durable Goods Orders.  Breaking news this morning, the expectation is up eight-tenths of a percent.  Meanwhile, President Trump just tweeted that he welcomes Sleepy Joe Biden to the 2020 Presidential Race.  Dr. Jill Biden tweeting she's excited and proud her husband is running for president.</p><p>Earnings are in focus this morning.  3M was a miss.  The Durable Goods Orders are 2.7 percent gain.  This is much better than the expectation, which was eight-tenths of a percent.  We're looking at a gain of 2.7 percent for the month of March for Durable Goods.  Let's look at markets to see if we're seeing any change.  3M is the earnings story of the morning.  It was a miss on revenue and earnings and that's set to cut 100 points off the Dow Jones Industrial average at the opening of trading.  As you see, the Dow is down 71 points so we are going to see a negative opening from the broader averages despite the fact that March Durable Goods Order's much better than expected, up 2.7 percent versus an estimate of eight-tenths of a percent.</p><p>These are big ticket items like refrigerators, items to last several years.  Durable Goods Orders is a good indicator of broad economic strength.  As our earnings, of course, at later tonight, we will hear from Amazon, Ford Motor, and Starbucks after the bell.  Markets are lower this morning as a result of 3M, although S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher.  NASDAQ Futures right now showing a gain of 28 points, one-third of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up two points, that's a fraction there, but the Dow is down 77.  In Europe this morning, it is largely a lower day, as you see across the board.  FT-100 down 41 points, two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>The CAC Quarante in Paris down 11, a quarter of a percent and the DAX Index down 12-1/2 points, that's a fractional loss there as well.  In Asia overnight, the big stories were the Bank of Japan meeting along with South Korean GDP.  We saw a decline in GDP, it was weaker than expected, and that pressured markets a bit.  As you see, the big hit was in china, Shanghai Composite down 2-1/2 percent.  Joining me right now is Cornerstone Macro Chief Investment Strategist, Michael Kantrowitz.  Great to see you, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO:  Thank you for having me here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  All right.  So we got the Durable Goods Orders out, we -- we're getting the earnings from the first quarter, how would you characterize the backdrop for investing?  Let's go macro first.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Sure.  Well, the broad economy is -- in the U.S. is still doing very well, although we are very focused on leading economic indicators like PMIs, consumer confidence, housing confidence, and those, in the last year or so, have weakened.  And so leading indicators beginning to decline is foreshadowing a slowdown in some of those other coincident economic indicators in earnings, which we're beginning to see play out.  Our concern is that in the back half of this year, there will be a growth scare foreshadowed by this current weakness and leading economic indicators like the ISM Index.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me ask you about that because you guys have been so great at Cornerstone Macro in terms of identifying the strength that we're seeing.  It's a very good backdrop, and, you know, Nancy Lazar, one of the founders of the company, has been you know, even in face of criticism about the fed, that things are going to, you know, tumble because of Europe and China, she has stayed firm in that things are very strong, but your call is that in the second half, we could weaken a bit.  Where does that come from, the weakness?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Sure.  Well, again, it's from leading indicators like PMIs and earnings, revisions in expectations starting to slow.  You know what's been unique about this market rally is that it's all been P/Es.  It's all been the expectation, and hope that things are going to get better and it's been the reduction of the fed, the fed coming out of the tightening story.  It's been tariff news getting more market friendly?</p><p>It's been the global economy potentially showing some signs of bottoming like we've seen in China.  But we think -- and looking back at past fed tightening cycles, all of the economic weakness in earnings particularly comes after the fed's last rate hike, so while we're all talking about the fed being done and out of the way, the reality is that we're still digesting what the fed has done over the last 2-1/2, three years.  And that's going to hang with us for another 12 months or so, which where we think there could be some disappointment in the back half this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean do you think the Federal Reserve raises rates?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  No.  No.  We're -- we don't think the fed will raise rates again.  And so we do think bond yields with -- as markets begin to, I think, realize that.  We will see bond yields come back down a little bit on the 10-Year, for example, but it's really -- it's not just the fed that raises rates and causes a tightening cycle, we're now seeing banks begin to tighten lending standards, which often happens in the wake of a fed tightening cycle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  I see.  But capex has been pretty strong.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  True.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know that's one of the more important indicators that you guys look at.  And capex, particularly into I.P. technology, R&amp;D, that's been quite strong.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Absolutely.  Yes.  The growth in I.T. and the just the U.S. having -- especially the market, having the benefit.  You mentioned earlier, the NASDAQ is up today, the Dow is down, that's been the story pretty much.  The relative out performance of the NASDAQ has been the story all year because the U.S. markets have so much growth and stability in those tech sectors, and so it's one of the reasons we continue.  Like U.S. equity markets, even though they're generally more expensive than the rest of the world, but there's a reason they're more expensive because they have that sustainable growth whereas countries like Europe, and emerging markets have much more cyclicality in them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your call on the semiconductors.  Texas Instruments, obviously, was focused this week.  The company beat earnings expectations and delivered better than expected sales outlook, however, some people were questioning whether or not it's actually quite strong because they had indications that the industry wasn't as strong as people thought.  You wrote a report on semiconductors called Timber, Don't Write Wood.  Tell me about that.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Well, sure.  Well, that, we were specifically talking about lumber prices.  That was not directly related to semiconductors, but somewhat of a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, OK then.  This is the lumber report.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  -- somewhat of a good time real time leading indicator of U.S. economic activity and so with semiconductors though, when I talked about earlier that P/Es have been driving the market higher for semis, for example, the P/E of the semi group is up, I think, 45 percent this morning.  So you've gone -- you've seen semiconductors valuations go from five, six-year lows, to 10-year highs in the last four months so they're called kind of a rags to riches story.  And so the valuation story for semis is gone and the fundamentals are not yet improving.</p><p>And what T.I. said in their earnings report was that we're only into the second quarter of a slowdown, a typical slowdown in the semi space.  It tends to last about four to five quarters, so that's consistent with our view more broadly that earnings, which are slowing, will continue slowing and not pick up.  Investors today are expecting a imminent and sharp pickup in earnings expectations right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you want to -- do you want to sell semis then?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  We would be fading semiconductors and other various cyclical groups like autos, even I think housing, which has benefited from the big drop in interest rates.  I think we've gotten the max benefit, if you will, from the drop in rates.  If interest rates continue falling from here, or if the fed gets more dovish, we don't think that's going to be something that'll support the equity market because it'll likely happen because of a disappointment in economic activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So people will basically view the Federal Reserve lowering rates as an indication that things are pretty slow.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Sure.  If the fed were to cut rates, which is not our near term view, that something bad has likely happened and the markets are likely lower ahead of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-huh.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  We think it's quite a high bar for the fed to lower rates today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me about the commodities part of things, this report on timber and lumber.  What is that telling us?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Sure.  When we look at lumber prices, it's a phenomenal -- has a phenomenal fit with actual -- as a leading indicator of earnings growth, PMIs, which is something we focus on as another measure of a leading indicator.  And lumber prices are down about 60 percent year-over-year, one of the biggest drops actually going back to the early '90s.  And so historically, that's been a good foreshadowing of a continued weakness in leading indicators --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So --</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  -- which would portend further downward revisions for earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that indicate weakness in the housing sector?  Obviously wood and --</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  It could.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of construction.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Yes.  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And are there any other indicators like that like iron, or -- that you would -- that you would point to for further indication of that?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Lumber prices are more of coincident indicator.  When we try to figure out -- figure out where earnings momentum in the economy is going and ultimately where you want to be positioned within the market?  We look at things that lead, things like the industrial production report like we got or the durables report we got today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  And that's -- there tends to be things like monetary policy.  So, yes, the feds raise rates, they are done but kind of like when you have a big meal, you don't feel -- you don't get that stomachache until an hour after you've eaten that meal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  And so the fed kind of stopped eating, if you will, but we still think there is a stomachache if you will for the economy in the next couple of quarters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, in terms of that slowdown that you're expecting second half of the year, will the markets take a cue from that?  Do you want to buy stocks here or do you want to sell given the fact that you are expecting the backdrop to weaken?</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  Sure.  So the market's gone up entirely on P/E expansion, which has been a function of reducing the risks around the fed, tariffs, the dollar, which is now beginning to move up again, so that could become a risk.  And the global slowdown, which we think will continue into the end of this year.  And so P/Es aren't going to help anymore, and so you're now back to earnings.  We think earnings are going to disappoint so I think the market is for the year is about as high as it's going to get.  Could go higher a little bit, sure, but I would actually be moving more into groups that are beneficiaries of a slowdown or disappointment, such as staples, utilities, health care, still sticking with some high quality tech growth names, those will do better than other cyclical names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will it there.  Michael, great to have you on the show.</p><p>KANTROWITZ:  All right.  Thank you so much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so muck.  Michael Kantrowitz, Cornerstone Macro.  Coming up, eye on Amazon this evening.  The retail giant reporting earnings today after the closing.  Stuart Varney will weigh in on that with his expectations.  Then glamor meets camping, we are taking a look into the big business glamping, a luxury camping experience that lets you experience great outdoors without the work, back in a minute with that, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The big business of Amazon, the retail giant reporting earnings after the bell.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Stu, good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I just wonder, Maria, if Amazon will take its cue from Microsoft and Facebook which, this morning, are zooming after their very positive earnings reports yesterday.  Now I'm not leading anybody on here.  I am suggesting though that if Amazon comes out with blowout earnings, they could be headed very sharply higher just like Microsoft and Facebook.  I've got a caveat here, though, one of the reasons that Microsoft is up so sharply is that their cloud business performed so very well.  Up 73 percent, as I -- as I'm reading the numbers.  Well, Amazon is big in the cloud business as well.  They're a direct competitor with Microsoft for the cloud industry, so to speak.</p><p>If Microsoft is doing so well, does that mean that Amazon is not doing so well in the cloud?  And if that's the case, then the stock probably won't zoom as much as it might other things being the same, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens this afternoon.  The indication is, I'm looking on the board now, Amazon's up about 20 bucks at $19.22.  I just wonder if there is a blowout report, they're doing well in the cloud, do they hit $2,000 today or tomorrow morning?  Which is it?  I'm just wondering.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>VARNEY:  Just saying.  Just saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you believe this stock price, $1,900?</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, it's been above 2,000 before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Looks set to get back to that.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder why they don't split it, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  I -- I've never understood that.  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean look at Google, $1,200 a share.  Back in the day, you know 10 years ago, you split when you got to about $80.00, $90.00, $100 a share.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  That was kind of normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p>VARNEY:  Also Berkshire Hathaway stood out, it went up to, what, 40,000 or something.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>VARNEY:  I just don't know what else --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's -- and let's not forget where Google went public.  What was it, $75.00?</p><p>VARNEY:  Something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it was $75.00.  They -- remember they did that --</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that public offering that they didn't use, banks traditionally the way that regular IPOs are done?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And here it is at 1,273.</p><p>VARNEY:  Who -- and I cannot understand why they don't split.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I just don't get that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Stu, I know you'll have a lot more in 15 minutes.  We'll see you at the top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA so stay with us for that.  But first, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are scrapping the merger talks.  Cheryl's on that right now in headlines.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Another big story this morning, Maria.  An announcement on the Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank deal was expected as soon as tomorrow, but Wall Street Journal has reported the agreement lacked investor support and it faced its opposition from labor unions.  The merger between the two struggling banks would have created Germany's largest financial institution.</p><p>Well, out of japan, Carlos Ghosn could be released from a Tokyo jail today.  The former Nissan Chairman has been granted bail for a second time, after being arrested back in November on charges of financial misconduct.  Now he continues to deny all charges against him including the latest concerning breach of trust for allegedly diverting $5 million in Nissan money.  And sources telling Maria Bartiromo once Ghosn's released, he won't be able to see or communicate with his wife, Carole, as part of his bail agreement.</p><p>Now Maria, when you spoke with Carole Ghosn last week, she told you her husband is in poor health.  Well, some music for concert lovers, ears to mark National Concert Week next week, Live Nation is offering quite a deal and selling tickets for just 20 bucks.  The bargain, good for more than 2,800 concerts across the country.  The tickets go on sale, get ready, Wednesday, May 1st.  All right.  Coming up, gone glamping, a look into the big business of luxury camping.  How to surely make you a happy camper, it's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you from outside in the plaza here at FOX.  The woods will never be the same, a new high end camping experience provided by Brooklyn-based Terra Glamping.  Joining me right now is Terra Glamping CEO and Co-Founder, Rebecca Martin.  And Rebecca, it's great to have you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REBECCA MARTIN, CEO, TERRA GLAMPING:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love Brooklyn and love the idea of this glamping, so that's glamorous camping.</p><p>MARTIN:  Correct.  Yes.  And we're Brooklyn-based, which is where you would think all of your outdoor companies are from, but we do -- we provide luxury glamping for -- in a hotel setting and also for special events all around the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is very cool.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This tent is so beautiful.  Let's go in and take a look at some of the features that we've got here.  Hello there.  Oh, wow.  Tell me about this.</p><p>MARTIN:  So these are our sleeping tents that we have at our glamping hotels, and all of the tents have memory foam mattresses, and beautiful bedding on them, so that when you're -- you can sleep outdoors and you can have that fresh air wafting through, but you can be comfortable.  You don't have to worry about sticks and bumps.  We have everything that you need from, you know, face wash, and sunscreen to cell phone chargers and books.  So it's like a hotel room right inside here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is very cool.  So, you know what, I actually -- I needed this one.  I stayed overnight in the Sahara Desert and I was freezing all night.  What about the temperature?  Because when I was in a tent, it was so cold I had to wear like three or four layers.  Is there some kind of a heating mechanism in here or no?</p><p>MARTIN:  So the beds.  The beds themselves are incredibly warm, they will heat up to your body temperature at night, and then we have down comforters on top of those.  We often have people who will say, \"Oh, I'm going to be freezing tonight.\"  Go in layers and then they strip it off in the middle of the night because the beds are so incredibly warm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, OK.  What is the benefit of glamping versus camping?  Tell me about that.</p><p>MARTIN:  So the benefit of being outdoors, the benefit of disconnecting from the crazy, busy world that we're always in right now, so we're always on our phones, we're always, you know, at work, and this way we can be in nature, but you don't have to lose the creature comforts.  There are a lot of people who --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look nice.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  There are a lot of people who don't want to be outdoors and this is a great way to open it up to so many more people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are opening it up this summer.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got plans to be out in New York.  East Hampton?</p><p>MARTIN:  East Hampton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tell me about that.</p><p>MARTIN:  So 30 tents, we're going to have, and East Hampton right on Gardiners Bay, so we're looking out on the water, to Sag Harbor, and we have the sleeping tents, we have a dining tent, lounge tents, we have kayaks, and standup paddleboards.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this idea.  That's fun.  How much is that -- the whole experience if somebody wanted to get into this tent on -- in East Hampton for a weekend in the summer?</p><p>MARTIN:  So Terra Glamping East Hampton, it starts $300 a night for this room, and weekends are two-night minimum on there, but you get breakfast as well, you know, the campfire, and a gourmet smorgasbord every night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my goodness.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's terrific.  So what's the reception been so far?</p><p>MARTIN:  Reception's been great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I mean it's a trend, I think, that that's going to come more mainstream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN:  Been in the business for five years at the infancy in America and it's just more and more companies are coming out.  People understanding.  I don't have to explain glamping anymore to people, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess -- I guess in the summer time, it's OK because the weather is nice.</p><p>MARTIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you won't be that cold.</p><p>MARTIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's sort of like an Airbnb but in a tent.</p><p>MARTIN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Love it.  Rebecca, great to have you.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Check it out, Rebecca Martin.  We'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Welcome back.  We're coming to you from outside the plaza.  Hey, thanks for coming out this morning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see everybody.  Let's get some final thoughts from our all-star panel.  How'd you guys like the glamorous tent?  Over to you, Mitch.  Final thoughts.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I did like the glamorous tent.  Durable Goods Orders came out earlier at 2.7 percent, which was way ahead of expectations.  Tomorrow, we have GDP, which could also exceed expectations.  So, maybe the rumors of the demise of the U.S. economy were greatly exaggerated and we're starting off to a good start in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'd have to agree with that.  James, what do you say?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  American exceptionalism.  So far, kind of cool.  We'll look forward to tomorrow.  I like glamping as well.  I have a feeling Mrs. Freeman would especially like glamping.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  So my favorite story out this morning, I just saw this on Axios, this is of course given that Vice President Joe Biden is now officially running for the Democratic nomination, former Democratic Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly have a plan to teach 2020 candidates how to talk to a Trump voter.  How to talk to rural voters.  These two individuals, Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly couldn't even hold their Senate seats in their own states but they're going to tell other candidates how to win over voters.  That was the biggest belly laugh for me all morning so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.  Great analysis, as always.  Great to see you, guys.  Thanks so much for joining us.  It's been a show of breaking news throughout the morning.  Have a great day, everybody.  A big hello to Stuart Varney as we toss over to him.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Over to you, Stu, and \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\"</p><p>VARNEY:  All right, Maria, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2215218566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D12R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23045\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

US stock index futures dropped, tracking European markets a day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record high, as optimism in a virus-vaccine breakthrough and faith in the record tech rally was challenged by concerns over an unexpected frop in Eurozone PMIs which put the biggest recovery narrative in recent months in doubt.    Among US stocks, Deere &amp;#38; Co rose 4.5% premarket after it revised up its full-year earnings forecast and reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly profit. Pfizer rose 1.5% after reporting positive additional data from an early-stage study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine being developed in collaboration with German biotech firm BioNTech. U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech jumped 8.1%. Tesla gained another 1.8% after surging past the $2,000 mark on Thursday for the first time and extending its rally ahead of an upcoming share split. </p><p> US stocks finished higher on Thursday as investors continued to bet on tech heavyweights including Apple and Amazon.com to ride out the pandemic as U.S. data painted a picture of a wobbly economic recovery. However the market's bad breadth is getting extremely narrow: yesterday stocks closed green even though 70% of all companies closed in the red.  U.S. tech darlings \"continue to mask the broader concerns spearheading an end-of-week rally,\" saidNema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, head of research at Johannesburg-based Rand Merchant Bank. \"Wider credit spreads and bond bidding suggest an air of nervousness is starting to creep in.\"  Joe Biden accepted his party'snominationThursday to challenge President Donald Trump in a speech that cast November's election as not merely the choice of a president but a fundamental referendum on the nation's character.  Europeanstocks and the euro slumped after European PMI composite readings unexpectedly declined in August from July, missing expectations even as U.K. data was materially stronger (UK flash composite PMI 60.3 vs 57; est. 56.9). Job losses were a notable feature of the surveys.  As Goldman writes, after a record, better-than-expected cumulative improvement of 41.2pt over May-July, the Euro area composite PMI declined by 3.3pt to 51.6 in August, notably below expectations. The overall decline was heavily skewed towards the service sector, with the manufacturing PMI little changed from July. Across countries, the German and French composite PMIs were also weaker than expected, with the sequential weakening in France broad-based across sectors but solely concentrated in services in Germany. The implicit decline in the composite PMI outside of France and Germany was only marginally smaller than the decline in the Franco-German composite PMI. The weakening in the PMIs suggests that the pace of sequential growth has moderated as the gap in the level of activity relative to pre-Covid narrows (consistent with high-frequency activity indicators):  Euro Area Composite PMI (August, Flash): 51.6, consensus 55.0, last 54.9.  Euro Area Manufacturing PMI (August, Flash): 51.7, consensus 52.7, last 51.8.  Euro Area Services PMI (August, Flash): 50.1, consensus 54.5, last 54.7.  Germany Composite PMI (August, Flash): 53.7, consensus 55.0, last 55.3.  France Composite PMI (August, Flash): 51.7, consensus 57.0, last 57.3.    The broader miss was led by France whose manufacturing PMI unexpectedly dropped in August after a two-month rebound. The sharp fall put in doubt the country's recovery and led to a decline in the euro. Meanwhile Germany's recovery also lost momentum, with mixed PMI figures. PMI for services declined while manufacturing continued to improve  Earlier in the session, Asian stocks gained, led by communications and IT, after falling in the last session. Most markets in the region were up, with Taiwan's Taiex Index gaining 2% and South Korea's Kospi Index rising 1.3%, while Australia's S&amp;#38;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.1%. The Topix gained 0.3%, with Fujikyu and TSUNAGU GROUP HOLDINGS I rising the most. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5%, with Whirlpool China and Ningbo Jifeng Auto Parts posting the biggest advances.  Earlier this week, the S&amp;#38;P 500 clinched a record high, recouping the last of its losses caused by the coronavirus-driven slump and joining the Nasdaq in notching new highs even as investors remained on edge over a stalemate in talks between House Democrats and the White House over the next coronavirus aid bill as about 28 million Americans continued to collect unemployment checks. There was some hope that a deal would be reached tomorrow when a $25BN post office spending proposal is considered.  In FX, the dollar gained against a basket of its peers largely thanks to a sharp drop in the Euro which reversed an early gain that came at the back of hopes over a coronavirus vaccine after the latest PMI data challenged the narrative that euro area growth will outperform the US; the EURUSD slumped after data showed French manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in August after a two- month rebound; German and euro area data also missed expectations. The common currency retreated as much as 0.6% to 1.1780.    The euro poised for first weekly drop in nine; interbank desks fade the dip given Thursday's rebound after 21-DMA support held, yet short-term traders look for a move toward 1.1750, three traders in Europe said.  The offshore yuan rose to its strongest level in seven months against the dollar, as China's economic and market rebound from the pandemic has proved one of the world's fastest.  Elsewhere, Turkey's lira gained amid speculation President Recep Tayyip Erdogan willannouncea major Turkish energy discovery in the Black Sea later Friday.  In rates, Treasuries advanced while Europeanbond yields were flat to 1bp lower across the curves; the 10Y Treasury yield dropped -3bp to 0.6282%, flattening the 2s-10s curve. German 2-yr, 10-yr yields 1bp lower.  In commodities, Brent ($44.72) and WTI ($42.57) traded lower but were on track for a third weekly gain in New York trading. Gold slumped to $1920 as the dollar surged.  Looking ahead, expected data include PMIs and existing home sales.

The sharp fall put in doubt the country's recovery and led to a decline in the euro. Meanwhile Germany's recovery lost momentum, with mixed PMI figures. PMI for services declined while manufacturing continued to improve  Composite PMI fell below estimates in the euro-area.  The U.K. economy rebounded to a seven-year high, with composite PMI performing better than expected, while retail sales for July beat estimates, pushing the pound upwards momentarily  Global market snapshot courtesy of NewsSquawk:[3]  Asian equity markets traded mostly positive as the region benefitted from the tech-led gains on Wall St where Apple prodded above the USD 2tln market cap status and as firm gains in Tesla, Microsoft, Intel and Facebook also fuelled the big tech resurgence resulting to outperformance in the Nasdaq, although upside was capped in the broader market amid mixed data releases including higher than expected Initial Jobless Claims. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) both initially took impetus from the constructive handover from US peers but with upside in Australia later retraced following soft PMI data and with weakness seen in defensives as well as the top-weighted financials sector, while the Japanese benchmark contended with the effects of a mixed currency and resistance at the 23,000 level. Hang Seng (+1.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were underpinned amid the continued PBoC liquidity efforts in which it injected CNY 150bln through 7-day reverse repos and CNY 50bln in 14-day reverse repos. This was the first occasion the central bank utilized the latter instrument in around 2 months, and there was also recent confirmation from China's MOFCOM that the US and China will be conducting the delayed trade discussions in the approaching days. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat and continue to eye the 152.00 level to the upside despite the gains in Japanese stocks, with mild support provided by the BoJ's presence in the market for JPY 870bln of JGBs and the central bank also offered to purchase JPY 200bln in corporate bonds from 25th August with a remaining 3-5yrs to maturity.

Covid-19 Brought It Back  European equities (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) have held onto opening gains despite a brief dip lower in the wake of French PMI metrics. However, the pessimism surrounding the August outturn for France was short-lived for broader European assets with equities paring declines ahead of the German release. The German release painted a slightly less downbeat picture with a firmer manufacturing outturn alongside a softer than expected services, with the eventual EZ-wide release posting a miss on expectations for both sectors but ultimately remaining in expansionary territory. IHS Markit noted 'the eurozone stands at a crossroads, with growth either set to pick back up in coming months or continue to falter following the initial post-lockdown rebound'. Nonetheless, sentiment for European equities remains afloat in what has been a relatively choppy week in terms of price action for the region. Sectoral performance in Europe is broadly firmer with the exception of energy names which are tracking crude prices lower. Travel &amp;#38; Leisure names are faring the best thus far with some reprieve been granted to the likes of Ryanair (+1.6%) and easyJet (+1.4%), however, with the UK continuing to add more countries to its quarantine list (albeit, has removed Portugal), it's difficult to see how much conviction will be placed upon a recovery in the sector. Elsewhere, individual movers include Kingspan (+7.4%) post-earnings, Wirecard (+5.4%) amid reports that it has found a suitor for its UK assets, whilst Accor (+2.6%) shares continue to remain supported alongside talk of a potential bid for InterContinental Hotels. To the downside, laggards are relatively sparse with Maersk (-2.8%) and Saipem (-2%) lower on the day following downgrades at JP Morgan Chase and Bernstein respectively.  Top European News  Europe's Economic Recovery Stumbles After Initial Bounceback  U.K. Economy Rebounds With Activity Rising to Seven-Year High  Pessimism Returns to Brexit Talks as Hopes for Deal Slip Away  Advent Said to Mull Over $1.2 Billion Sale of Health Firm Mediq  In FX, sub-par French Flash PMIs triggered the losses in the Single Currency, with the French manufacturing metric surprisingly falling back into contraction, whilst Germany and EZ held their heads above the 50 threshold, but largely missed forecasts. EUR/USD has receded from its 1.1882 high and took out an interim support area around 1.1840-45 to test 1.1800 to the downside. Participants will now be eyeing any updates on the Belarus front in regard to sanctions, with little on the docket in terms of scheduled events. Conversely, UK Retail Sales and PMIs topped forecasts across the board but gains Sterling were short-lived as the currency succumbs to the Buck, whilst Brexit talks remain in limbo as officials suggest no progress has been made on outstanding points in the latest round of negotiations. Cable has given up its 1.3200 status (vs. high 1.3255) and continues declining in light of pessimistic comments from both the EU and UK Chief Brexit negotiators, with the former nothing that at this stage, a deal seems unlikely and both sides highlight the little progress mate. EUR/GBP has recovered off lows amid the latest Brexit headlines, with the cross initially dipping below the Aug 13th low ~0.8948 before rebounding to session high at 0.8980.  DXY - Propped up by the post-PMI Euro - the index is back around 93.000 from an overnight base of 92.570 , with the highs from Wednesday (93.059) and Monday (93.124) the next points of resistance ahead of yesterday's peak at 93.248. Looking ahead to today, the calendar remains light with US Markit PMIs and Existing Home Sales the only scheduled events.  JPY - USD/JPY had been ebbing overnight in light of the weaker Dollar during APAC hours, but the JPY holds onto gains in early EU hours despite the Dollar rebound as PMI-related haven flows keeps the Japanese currency buoyed. USD/JPY dipped below 105.50 from 105.80 at best ahead of the weekly base at 105.104. Note: USD/JPY sees around USD 550mln in options rolling off at 105.00 at the NY cut.  AUD, CAD, NZD - All narrowly softer in what is a Dollar story. AUD/USD as dipped back below 0.7200 (vs. high 0.7215), whilst Westpac raised its year-end forecast to 0.7500 from 0.7200 as their case of a momentum stall is still not convincing. NZD/USD remains contained within a tight current range of 0.6525-0.6550, with overnight comments from the RBNZ Chief economy noting that the Central Bank has scope to act aggressively if needed. Similarly, the revival of the Dollar and declines in the crude complex sees the Loonie yield, with USD/CAD testing resistance at 1.3200 (vs. low 1.3159) ahead of Canadian Retail Sales, with today's option expiries seeing USD 505mln at 1.3225 alongside a sizeable USD 1.7bln between 1.3250-60.  EM - Mixed trade across EMs but the Lira stands out as the outperformer after the CBRT lifted the TRY interest rate on swap transactions from 8.25% to 9.75% yesterday to match the lending rate. Furthermore, the Turkish President is expected to announce 'good news' today in regard to an energy discover in the black sea, most likely natural gas. USD/TRY has trades sub-7.2500 from a high of 7.3380.  In commodities, WTI and Brent October futures have waned off overnight highs, albeit with the magnitude of price action relatively small thus far. Crude-specific news flow has remained light, but the contracts saw a sentiment-driven leg lower amid the overall down-beat flash PMIs from the EU. Both contracts trade lower by some USD 0.20/bbl apiece, with WTI testing USD 42.50/bbl to the downside (vs. high 42.96./bbl) whilst its Brent counterpart dipped below USD 44.75/bbl from around USD 45/bbl at best, with only the weekly Baker Hughes rig count slated on the calendar. Elsewhere, spot gold and spot silver yield to the post-PMI Dollar strength, with the former losing further ground below USD 1950/oz (vs. high 1956/oz) whilst latter briefly dipped below USD 27.00 from 27.54 at best. In terms of base metals, copper continued to grind lower with the Shanghai inventories again posting another rise in stocks. Dalian iron ore prices fell overnight as the steel-demand-driven rally somewhat fizzled whilst China's iron ore portside stockpile rose to four-month highs.  US Event Calendar  9:45am: Markit US Manufacturing PMI, est. 52, prior 50.9  9:45am: Markit US Services PMI, est. 51, prior 50  9:45am: Markit US Composite PMI, prior 50.3  10am: Existing Home Sales, est. 5.41m, prior 4.72m; MoM, est. 14.62%, prior 20.7%  DB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap  The brief excitement that we got in markets late Wednesday proved to be fairly short-lived in the end with equities at least pretty much back to the status quo again yesterday. Indeed there were more gains for the S&amp;#38;P which nudged up +0.32% with the NASDAQ (+1.06%) once again leading the way and finishing at yet another record high. However, all this came on a foundation of low volumes and pretty thin breadth of gains when you dig below the surface - a theme that's been fairly consistent all week. A stat that stood out yesterday was that just 30% of the S&amp;#38;P 500 actually advanced with the equal weighted index down -0.55%. In fact, while the benchmark S&amp;#38;P 500 is up +0.38% this week the equal weighted index is actually down -1.43%.  In fairness markets did open on the back foot after the latest weekly initial jobless claims data came in at a higher-than-expected 1.106m for the week through August 15. That was well above the consensus forecast of 920k, and marks a rebound from the prior week's 971k reading, which was the first time the weekly number had fallen below a million since the pandemic began. Though it's only one week, the +135k increase in claims is the largest weekly jump since late March, and raises fears that the labour market recovery is unlikely to be a smooth one. While continuing claims represented somewhat better news, with a decline to 14.844m in the week through August 8 (vs 15m expected), they still remain at more than twice the peak after the GFC back in 2009, suggesting there's still a long way to go before we get back to any king of normality.  Treasury yields were already a couple basis points lower going into that and they held that level into the evening with 10y yields in particular closing -2.9bps lower. The curve also keeps doing its best to unwind some of last week's bear steepening with 2s10s and 5s30s curves both -3.1bps flatter yesterday. Meanwhile the USD had a more choppy session but ultimately ended a shade weaker with the dollar index down -0.10%. It's also down a further -0.16% this morning.  On that, it's worth noting that yesterday our FX team took profit on their EURUSD trade having nearly reached their 1.20 target earlier this week. They now see a more balanced outlook approaching September, with positioning becoming stretched, virus statistics becoming worse in Europe, and the Fed signalling a less dovish stance for September. This isn't to say that they're turning bullish on the dollar all of a sudden, but having nearly reached 1.20 the risks are more evenly balanced in comparison to their strong conviction view earlier this year. See their full note here.  Looking ahead to today, the highlight will likely be the release of the flash PMIs for August, which will give us one of the first indications of global economic performance into the month. Overnight, we've already had the Australian and Japanese numbers with Japan's manufacturing PMI coming in at 46.6 (vs. 45.2 last month) however the services print fell to 45.0 (vs. 45.4 last month). The decline in the services PMI was more pronounced in Australia given the localized lockdowns as it came in at 48.1 (vs. 58.2 last month) but the manufacturing PMI was relatively stable at 53.9 (vs. 54.0 last month). Later today, we'll hear from Europe and the US, where the consensus is expecting a continued rebound in activity from the lows of the initial lockdowns. Remember though that these are diffusion indices, so they simply ask respondents whether conditions are better or worse than in the previous month, rather than measuring growth itself. As a result they can struggle to capture the extent of any declines or rebounds when the numbers are at extreme levels as they've been recently.  This will be important to keep in mind if the current uptick of coronavirus cases persists and causes partial shutdowns of economies in infected areas. Italy reported the most new cases since mid-May yesterday, while weekly cases in the UK have recently risen over 8000 for the first time since early June. However, despite cases rising, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron have indicated they oppose nationwide lockdowns, and want the continent to coordinate a strategy for avoiding a further economic slowdown from the virus. In Asia, South Korea's new infection wave has spread nationwide and the country reported additional 324 cases in the past 24 hours. On the positive side, Pfizer and BioNTech said that their vaccine candidate is on track for regulatory review as early as October, assuming clinical success. Meanwhile, the NHK reported that Japan is set to allow foreign residents shut out by virus-related restrictions back into the country from September.  Asian markets have followed Wall Street's lead this morning with the Nikkei (+0.43%), Hang Seng (+1.25%), Shanghai Comp (+0.78%) and Kospi (+2.27%) all up. The positive vaccine news mentioned above seems to be aiding sentiment. Futures on the S&amp;#38;P 500 are also up +0.27%. In terms of other data releases, Japan's July CPI came in line with consensus at +0.3% yoy while both core and core-core CPI came in a shade lower than expectations at unchanged and +0.4% yoy respectively.  In other overnight news, President Trump said that 'We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America, and if they don't do it, we will put tariffs on those companies, and they will have to pay us a lot of money,' if he gets re-elected.  Back to yesterday, there weren't any major surprises from the release of the ECB minutes. In terms of things to note, they showed that the Governing Council's focus was shifting away from market stabilisation as a focus towards price stability. For example, the number of references to 'financial conditions' fell to 8 in the latest minutes, having been 23 back in June. There was also more time devoted to the weakness in longer-term inflation expectations, with 3 mentions versus 1 in the last minutes. The STOXX 600 closed down -1.07% in Europe yesterday while bond yields on the continent were 1-3bps lower with the exception of BTPs which finished flat.  In other news, yesterday we got confirmation that China and the US are to have a call soon to discuss the progress of their trade deal, expected in the 'near term' although no exact date was given. Kudlow confirmed yesterday that Lighthizer 'has said a number of times that he actually is pleased with the progress' on the trade pact. Further evidence therefore of ring-fencing the trade pact in the US-China tit for tat. Staying with US politics, moderate Democrats from swing states are urging Speaker Pelosi and Congressional Republicans to restart stimulus talks that have stalled. However Pelosi also noted that she would not support a 'skinny bill that only dealt with the unemployment benefits without offering funding help to the states that need it.  As for the remaining data yesterday, August's Philadelphia Fed business index came in at 17.2 (vs. 20.8 estimated), down from last month's 24.1 reading. This is the second month in a row that the gauge has fallen, though the ISM adjusted index ticked up higher to 54.1 from 53.6. Over in Europe, the German PPI reading for July was up 0.2% from the previous month (vs. 0.1% expected), while down -1.7% YoY.  To the day ahead now, and the data highlight is likely to be the aforementioned flash PMIs for August. As well as that, we'll get UK retail sales and public finance data for July, the advance Euro Area consumer confidence reading for June, US existing home sales for July, and Canada's retail sales for June.

digital coin on Wednesday, insisting tough regulatory problems would have to be worked out first.<br/>The massive social media company's plan to launch a digital coin has met with a chorus from regulators, central bankers and governments saying it must respect anti-money-laundering rules and ensure the security of transactions and user data.</p><p><br/>But there are also deeper concerns that the powers of big tech companies increasingly encroach on areas belonging to governments, like issuing currency.<br/>\"The sovereignty of nations cannot be jeopardised,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists after chairing the first day of the two-day meeting.<br/>\"The overall mood around the table was clearly one of important concerns about the recent Libra announcements, and a shared view that action is needed urgently,\" he added.<br/>German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Facebook's plans do not \"seem to be fully thought through\", adding that there were also data security questions.<br/>\"I am convinced that we must act quickly and that (Libra) cannot go ahead without all legal and regulatory questions being resolved,\" Scholz told journalists.<br/>France, which chairs the Group of Seven advanced economies this year, has asked European Central Bank executive board member Benoit Coeure to set up a G7 task force to look into crypto-currencies and digital coins like the Libra.<br/>Coeure presented a preliminary report to ministers and central bankers at the meeting, in the quaint chateau town of Chantilly, north of Paris.<br/>Central bankers say that if Facebook wants to take deposits, it needs a banking licence, which would subject it to the strict regulation that goes with operating in that industry.<br/>Some central bankers also say that allowing people to transact anonymously is a non-starter given financial sector regulations that require payments firms to hold basic information about their customers.<br/>JAPAN: GLOBAL CONSENSUS NEEDED<br/>Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the G7 task force was likely to evolve over time into something including a broader range of regulators beyond the group, given the huge impact Libra could have on the global economy.<br/>\"If the Libra is aspiring to be used globally, countries must seek a globally coordinated response,\" Kuroda said.<br/>\"This is not something that can be discussed among G7 central banks alone.\"<br/>G7 finance ministers are also concerned about how best to tax big tech companies, with France keen to use its presidency of the two-day meeting to get broad support for ensuring minimum corporate taxation.<br/>G7 governments are concerned that decades-old international tax rules have been pushed to the limit by the emergence of companies like Facebook and Apple, which book profits in low-tax countries regardless of the source of the underlying income.<br/>The issue has become more vexed than ever in recent days as Paris defied U.S. President Donald Trump last week by passing a tax on big digital firms' revenues in France, despite a threat from Trump to launch a probe that could lead to trade tariffs.<br/>Their bilateral dispute aside, France and the United States are in favour of rules ensuring minimum taxation as part of an effort among nearly 130 countries to overhaul international tax rules.<br/>Although a G7 agreement would set the tone for the broader push, an agreement among all of the G7 ministers on a minimum rate or range of rates is likely to prove elusive as Britain and Canada have reservations, a French Finance Ministry source said.<br/>\"If we don't agree at the G7 level on the broad principles for taxing digital companies today or tomorrow, then quite frankly it will be complicated to find among 129 countries at the OECD,\" Le Maire said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Facebook's Libra digital coin, insisting tough regulatory problems would have to be worked out first, Reuters reports.</p><p>The massive social media company's plan to launch a digital coin has met with a chorus from regulators, central bankers and governments saying it must respect anti-money-laundering rules and ensure the security of transactions and user data.</p><p>But there are also deeper concerns that the powers of big tech companies increasingly encroach on areas belonging to governments, like issuing currency.</p><p>\"The sovereignty of nations cannot be jeopardized,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists after chairing the first day of the two-day meeting.</p><p>\"The overall mood around the table was clearly one of important concerns about the recent Libra announcements, and a shared view that action is needed urgently,\" he added.</p><p>German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Facebook's plans do not \"seem to be fully thought through\", adding that there were also data security questions.</p><p>\"I am convinced that we must act quickly and that [Libra] cannot go ahead without all legal and regulatory questions being resolved,\" Scholz told journalists.</p><p>France, which chairs the Group of Seven advanced economies this year, has asked European Central Bank executive board member Benoit Coeure to set up a G7 task force to look into cryptocurrencies and digital coins like Libra.</p><p>Coeure presented a preliminary report to ministers and central bankers at the meeting, in the quaint chateau town of Chantilly, north of Paris.</p><p>Central bankers say that if Facebook wants to take deposits, it needs a banking license, which would subject it to the strict regulation that goes with operating in that industry.</p><p>Some central bankers also say that allowing people to transact anonymously is a non-starter given financial sector regulations that require payments firms to hold basic information about their customers.</p><p>Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the G7 task force was likely to evolve over time into something including a broader range of regulators beyond the group, given the huge impact Libra could have on the global economy.</p><p>\"If the Libra is aspiring to be used globally, countries must seek a globally coordinated response,\" Kuroda said.</p><p>\"This is not something that can be discussed among G7 central banks alone.\"</p><p>-- Contact us at <email

France wants to use its presidency of the two-day meeting in the picturesque chateau town of Chantilly north of Paris to get broad support for ensuring minimum corporate taxation. G7 governments are concerned that decades-old international tax rules have been pushed to the limit by the emergence of Facebook and Apple, which book profits in low-tax countries regardless of the source of the underlying income. </p><p>The issue has become more vexed than ever in recent days as Paris defied U.S. President Donald Trump last week by passing a tax on big digital firms' revenues in France despite a threat from him to launch a probe that could lead to trade tariffs. \"France is a sovereign nation and will continue of course to decide as a sovereign nation on all taxation issues,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at a conference at the French central bank on the eve of the G7 meeting. \"So let's work during the G7... on that key question of digital taxation because this is for us the best way to fix this issue,\" Le Maire added. Their bilateral dispute aside, France and the United States are in favour of rules ensuring minimum taxation as part of an effort among 139 countries to overhaul international tax rules. Although a G7 agreement would set the tone for the broader push, an agreement among all of the G7 ministers on a minimum rate or range of rates is likely to prove elusive as Britain and Canada have reservations, a French Finance Ministry source said on Friday. Common ground should be found more easily among ministers and central bankers present at the meeting on the issue of digital currencies and coins. Facebook's recent announcement of plans to launch a digital coin has met with a chorus from regulators, central bankers and governments insisting it must respect anti-money-laundering rules and ensure the security of transactions and user data. But there are also deeper concerns that the growing powers of big tech companies increasingly encroach on areas belonging to governments, like issuing currency. \"These digital giants are turning into private states - states over which citizens have no control and where democracy has no place,\" Le Maire said. \"We cannot let companies, which are serving private interests, gather all the attributes of sovereign states. We must act,\" he added. Off the official agenda, ministers are also due to consult on possible successors to replace Christine Lagarde at the head of the International Monetary Fund. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and some European ministers are due to meet with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has been mooted as a possible candidate for the IMF job.

Authored by Aaron Wood via CoinTelegraph.com,[3] The G7 group of nations has reportedly drafted a report which says that 'global stablecoins' pose a threat to the global financial system.    image courtesy of CoinTelegraph[4]  According to the BBC on Oct. 13, a draft report from the G7outlined[5]the various risks associated with digital currencies. </p><p>It also said that, even if member firms of the governing Libra Association addressed regulatory concerns, it may not get approval from the necessary regulators, stating:  \"The G7 believe that no stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed.  [...] Addressing such risks is not necessarily a guarantee of regulatory approval for a stablecoin arrangement.\"  The G7 also states that global stablecoins with the potential to scale rapidly could stifle competition and threaten financial stability if users lose confidence in the coin.  \"the introduction of 'global stablecoins' could pose a host of challenges to the regulatory community, not least because they have the potential to become systemically important, including through the substitution of domestic currencies.  These include challenges for financial stability; consumer and investor protection; data privacy and protection; financial integrity including AML/CFT and know-your-customer compliance; mitigation of tax evasion; fair competition and anti-trust policy; market integrity; sound and efficient governance; cyber security and operational risks; and an appropriate legal basis.\"  The report will purportedly be presented to finance ministers[6] at an annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund this week.  Further problems for Libra?  The BBC states that, while the report does not single out Facebook's proposed Libra stablecoin project, it could spell further trouble for the already beleaguered proposed payments system.  Global regulators are increasingly leaning on the project, with the Bank of England recentlyestablishing[7]provisions with which it must comply before it can be issued in the United Kingdom.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg willtestify[8]before the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee about Libra later this month. The head of the committee, Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, has been a noted critic of the project. Earlier this year, the committeedrafted[9]the 'Keep Big Tech out of Finance Act.'  Libra has seen several major partner firms of its governing consortium leave the project recently. On Oct. 4, major payments network PayPalwithdrew[10]from the organization and was soonfollowed[11]by Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay.  Furthermore, Finco Services of Delawareinitiated[12]a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and 'false designation of origin' regarding the use of the Libra logo. The plaintiff is also suing its former designer, who did the logo work for Facebook, for reusing the design.

As the crypto news today[1] show, the (Group Of Seven) G7 says that there are many risks associated with digital currencies, according to reports by BBC on October 13. The report[2] also said that even if member firms of the governing Libra Association addressed regulatory concerns, it may not get approval from the necessary regulators. </p><p>The full report in which G7 says this shows the following: 'The G7 believe that no stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed. [] Addressing such risks is not necessarily a guarantee of regulatory approval for a stablecoin arrangement.' The G7 also says that global stablecoins with the potential to scale rapidly are the ones that could stir up the competition and threaten the financial stability if users lose confidence in the coin. The report will purportedly be presented to finance ministers at an annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund[3] this week. The BBC features that G7 says that while the report does not single out Facebook's Libra stablecoin project - it could spell further trouble for the already beleaguered proposed payments system, the Libra news[4] show. On the other hand, we have global regulators that are increasingly leaning on the project. The Bank of England (BoE)[5] recently established provisions with which it must comply before it can be issued in the United Kingdom. The CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, will testify before the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee about Libra this month. Earlier this year, the committee drafted[6] its 'Keep Big Tech out of Finance Act.' While G7 says that stablecoins like Libra are a threat to the financial system, it seems like the backers behind Libra are on the same page. If you followed our previous news, you probably know that on October 4, the major payments network PayPal withdrew from the organization[7] - later followed by Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay. Furthermore, we saw Finco Services of Delaware initiating a lawsuit against Facebook and alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and 'false designation of origin' regarding the use of the Libra logo.

Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>The G7 are concerned that Facebook's ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks.</p><p>\"A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion,\" European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, the chairman of the task force, told the G7 meeting.</p><p>\"However ... they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, cyber resilience, fair competition and tax compliance.\"</p><p>The G7 also agreed that large tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present.</p><p>They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a \"race to the bottom\" to attract business from digital multinationals.</p><p>\"A minimum level of effective taxation, such as for example the U.S. GILTI regime, would contribute to ensuring that companies pay their fair share of tax,\" the chair summary concluded.</p><p>The U.S.'s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime (GILTI) aims to subject overseas intangible income to 10.5 per cent to discourage firms from shifting profits abroad to avoid the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate of 21 per cent.</p><p>Using the GILTI regime could help allay possible U.S. fears that the new rules could discriminate against U.S. companies.</p><p>\"We're beginning to develop a framework ... We feel very strongly that this should not just be geared at the U.S. digital companies,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told journalists.</p><p>An outline of the new regime and its implementation is to be developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of the year, so that the details can be agreed by the end of 2020.</p><p>Several European countries including France, Italy, Britain and Spain already have introduced their own taxes on digital companies or plan to do so. Washington saw the French levy as discriminating against U.S. companies, and launched a probe that could lead to the imposition of tariffs on French goods.</p><p>Le Maire said Paris would keep its levy in place until the new, internationally agreed tax replaced it.</p><p>The meeting comes amid growing global economic uncertainty as U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing trade threaten to undermine a prolonged recovery.</p><p>Additional reporting by Leigh Thomas, Myriam Rivet, Francesco Canepa and Michael Nienhaber; writing by Leika Kihara and Jan Strupczewski; editing by Mark John and Kevin Liffey Reuters !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

And so our job is to think about safe too ... We've got an emerging sense that we need to work together on this.\"</p><p>In a summary of the informal G7 talks in Chantilly, north of Paris, the French presidency said the ministers and governors had agreed that \"stablecoins and other various new products currently being developed, including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra, raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns.\"</p><p>Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>The G7 also agreed that large tech companies can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present there.</p><p>They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a \"race to the bottom\" to attract business from digital multinationals. The U.S.'s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime (GILTI) aims to subject overseas intangible income to 10.5 per cent to discourage firms from shifting profits abroad to avoid the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate of 21 per cent.</p><p>Using the GILTI regime could help allay possible U.S. fears that the new rules could discriminate against U.S. companies.</p><p>\"We're beginning to develop a framework ... We feel very strongly that this should not just be geared at the U.S. digital companies,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told journalists.</p><p>An outline of the new regime and its implementation is to be developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of the year, so that the details can be agreed by the end of 2020.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the G7 top world economies, told a news conference the group opposed the idea that companies could have the same privilege as nations in creating means of payment - but without the control and obligations that go with it. 'We cannot accept private companies issuing their own currencies without democratic control,' Le Maire said. </p><p>In a summary of the informal G7 talks in Chantilly, north of Paris, the French presidency said the ministers and governors had agreed that 'stablecoins and other various new products currently being developed, including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra, raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns'. Governments are starting to worry that big tech companies are encroaching on areas that belong to governments, such as issuing currency. Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments. The G7 are concerned that Facebook's ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks. 'A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion,' European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, the chairman of the taskforce, told the G7 meeting.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol'However they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, cyber resilience, fair competition and tax compliance.'Digital taxesThe G7 also agreed that large tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present there. They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a 'race to the bottom' to attract business from digital multinationals. 'A minimum level of effective taxation, such as for example the U.S. GILTI regime, would contribute to ensuring that companies pay their fair share of tax,' the chair summary concluded. The U.S.'s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime (GILTI) aims to subject overseas intangible income to 10.5% to discourage firms from shifting profits abroad to avoid the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. Using the GILTI regime could help allay possible U.S. fears that the new rules could discriminate against U.S. companies. 'We're beginning to develop a framework We feel very strongly that this should not just be geared at the U.S. digital companies,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told journalists. An outline of the new regime and its implementation is to be developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of the year, so that the details can be agreed by the end of 2020. Several European countries including France, Italy, Britain and Spain have already introduced their own taxes on digital companies or plan to do so. Washington saw the French levy as discriminating against U.S. companies, and launched a probe[2] that could lead to the imposition of tariffs on French goods. Le Maire said Paris would keep its levy in place until the new, internationally agreed tax replaced it. The meeting comes amid growing global economic uncertainty as U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing trade threaten to undermine a prolonged recovery.

Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>The G7 are concerned that Facebook's ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks.</p><p>\"A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion,\" European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, the chairman of the taskforce, told the G7 meeting.</p><p>\"However ... they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, cyber resilience, fair competition and tax compliance.\"</p><p>DIGITAL TAXES</p><p>The G7 also agreed that large tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present there.</p><p>They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a \"race to the bottom\" to attract business from digital multinationals.</p><p>\"A minimum level of effective taxation, such as for example the U.S. GILTI regime, would contribute to ensuring that companies pay their fair share of tax,\" the chair summary concluded.</p><p>The U.S.'s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime (GILTI) aims to subject overseas intangible income to 10.5% to discourage firms from shifting profits abroad to avoid the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%.</p><p>Using the GILTI regime could help allay possible U.S. fears that the new rules could discriminate against U.S. companies.</p><p>\"We're beginning to develop a framework ... We feel very strongly that this should not just be geared at the U.S. digital companies,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told journalists.</p><p>An outline of the new regime and its implementation is to be developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of the year, so that the details can be agreed by the end of 2020.</p><p>Several European countries including France, Italy, Britain and Spain have already introduced their own taxes on digital companies or plan to do so. Washington saw the French levy as discriminating against U.S. companies, and launched a probe that could lead to the imposition of tariffs on French goods.</p><p>Le Maire said Paris would keep its levy in place until the new, internationally agreed tax replaced it.</p><p>The meeting comes amid growing global economic uncertainty as U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing trade threaten to undermine a prolonged recovery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRDNEW-3092545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-PWX1-DY3K-T0MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend Daily News (Azerbaijan)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61542\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook's June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.</p><p>The G7 are concerned that Facebook's ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks.</p><p>\"A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion,\" European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, the chairman of the taskforce, told the G7 meeting.</p><p>\"However ... they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, cyber resilience, fair competition and tax compliance.\"</p><p>DIGITAL TAXES</p><p>The G7 also agreed that large tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present there.</p><p>They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a \"race to the bottom\" to attract business from digital multinationals.</p><p>\"A minimum level of effective taxation, such as for example the U.S. GILTI regime, would contribute to ensuring that companies pay their fair share of tax,\" the chair summary concluded.</p><p>The U.S.'s Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime (GILTI) aims to subject overseas intangible income to 10.5% to discourage firms from shifting profits abroad to avoid the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%.</p><p>Using the GILTI regime could help allay possible U.S. fears that the new rules could discriminate against U.S. companies.</p><p>\"We're beginning to develop a framework ... We feel very strongly that this should not just be geared at the U.S. digital companies,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told journalists.</p><p>An outline of the new regime and its implementation is to be developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by the end of the year, so that the details can be agreed by the end of 2020.</p><p>Several European countries including France, Italy, Britain and Spain have already introduced their own taxes on digital companies or plan to do so. Washington saw the French levy as discriminating against U.S. companies, and launched a probe that could lead to the imposition of tariffs on French goods.</p><p>Le Maire said Paris would keep its levy in place until the new, internationally agreed tax replaced it.</p><p>The meeting comes amid growing global economic uncertainty as U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing trade threaten to undermine a prolonged recovery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRDECO-3092545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRDECO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-PWX1-DY3K-T0DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"644\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend Daily Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61541\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook\u2019s June 18 announcement of Libra heralded an effort to expand beyond social networking and move into e-commerce and global payments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The G7 is concerned that Facebook\u2019s ambitions for a digital currency might not only weaken their control over monetary and banking policies but also pose security risks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cA global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion,\u201d European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, the chairman of the taskforce, told the G7 meeting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cHowever ... they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, cyber resilience, fair competition and tax compliance.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>The G7 also agreed that large tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple can be taxed in the countries in which they make money, even without being physically present there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They also agreed that there should be a minimum level of tax to discourage countries from competing in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d to attract business from digital multinationals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHADLY-8677304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHADLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-P8N1-DYMS-S1WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383971</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"389\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Shanghai Daily Publishing House</copyright><publicationName>Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
