Not by a long shot.<br/>Government Abuse as a Threat to Freedom<br/>The genius of the Constitution is a result of the American Founders' understanding that our freedoms and rights precede government and that an unrestrained government is the biggest threat to those freedoms. The Founders limited the power of the government through an intricate system of enumerated powers, separation of powers, explicit rights, and rights retained by the people to impede the abuse of governmental power.<br/>Limiting the potential for governmental abuse was fundamental to the design of our constitutional order and remains an abiding concern. No such concern existed for \"big corporations\" because businesses do not wield the power to promulgate civil and criminal laws and exact punishment for violations of them. The state, not business, has a monopoly on compelled coercion.<br/>Government has the legal authority to incarcerate you, allocate your tax dollars how it sees fit, and foreclose on your home if you fail to mow the lawn.<br/>While laws and law enforcement are essential in a free and orderly society, government abuse at all levels has riddled our history (from FDR's internment camps to Jim Crow laws in the South) and is the stuff of daily headlines.<br/>Government has the legal authority to incarcerate you, allocate your tax dollars how it sees fit, and foreclose on your home if you fail to mow the lawn.<br/>You may recall the Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission involving Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop. Phillips was asked by a same-sex couple to create a wedding cake for their upcoming ceremony. Jack politely refused. A complaint was filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which led to a years-long struggle for Jack as he sought to protect his business, his brand, and his reputation. Even though the Supreme Court ultimately sided with Jack, the state of Colorado sought to punish him for exercising his freedom of speech and association.<br/>Where Is the Evidence of Corporations Threatening Freedom?<br/>Much of the nationalist right's recent lambasting of big business seems focused on social media. A few media personalities like Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos have been de-platformed for violating terms of service or community standards, but where is the widescale conservative or nationalist purge? Even when users from the right have been suspended \"permanently,\" social media has reversed course and reinstated their accounts, sometimes within 48 hours. (Ask your attorney if you can appeal a conviction or civil judgment brought by the government within 48 hours.)<br/>The reality is that no person has a constitutional or natural right to a social media account.<br/>The reality is that no person has a constitutional or natural right to a social media account. A user must agree to the terms of service and comply with community standards to enjoy the services offered by these platforms. No user can compel Facebook or Twitter to tolerate what it deems hateful or offensive language any more than they can compel Fox News to give airtime to pro-Antifa screeds.<br/>Where else is big business threatening conservatives' freedom? Are banks refusing mortgages to conservatives? Are hospitals refusing to treat them? Are auto dealers refusing to sell F150s to boomers because of MAGA memes? Certainly, there are unfortunate stories of well-known conservatives being refused service at local restaurants, but the multi-year investigation into the IRS's unfair treatment of conservative groups reveals where the greater threat lies.<br/>\"Big Business Hates Your Family\"<br/>Carlson's speech at the conference was titled \"Big Business Hates Your Family.\" While Carlson has railed against American companies for any number of reasons in recent years, his latest b\u00eate noire is Oreo. Nabisco, a parent company of Oreo, was in Carlson's crosshairs for advertising that suggests kids \"choose their pronoun\" with their Pride Month \"pronoun pack\" cookies.<br/>Tucker dismissed the idea that people can start their own competing business if they don't like a company's practices. This dismissal of entrepreneurship is puzzling coming from an entrepreneur; Carlson is the co-founder of an online publisher. But there is an even simpler course of action than starting your own cookie company. If you are not happy with Nabisco's business practices, buy different cookies... or bake your own at home with your family.<br/>It's not clear what policy Carlson would suggest in response to Oreo, but Carlson's characterization of big companies as monopolies may give a clue.<br/>Use a Scalpel, Not a Sledgehammer<br/>Carlson has blasted social media giants as \"digital monopolies.\"<br/>The big digital monopolies demand that we conform to their worldview and shut us down when we dissent. They have too much power. They are are threat to this country. Congress is doing nothing about it. It's time to complain, while we still can. #Tucker @FoxNews<br/>- Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) April 27, 2018<br/>Despite the national media celebrity's histrionics, there are dozens of social media platforms and search engines. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram might be the most popular for now, but if a conservative doesn't like these companies' policies, they can unplug, deactivate their account, or try other emerging platforms like Codias, MeWe, Ricochet, or an alternative search engine like DuckDuckGo.<br/>Decrying social media companies as monopolies suggests that the companies should be broken up under antitrust laws. However, the Federal Trade Commission enforces antitrust laws where there's a showing of anti-competitive practices. It isn't enough to say that a company is too large or the company's practices are not pleasing to pundits like Carlson.<br/>Giving users greater control over their own information would be one way to give consumers more power without breaking up the companies.<br/>If companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook engage in anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing or exclusionary contracts, they should be forced to comply with applicable law like any other company. But rather than fearmongering that these companies are a greater threat to freedom than the government, we should narrowly tailor a remedy.<br/>For instance, these tech companies' greatest competitive advantage is that they have collected extensive data over the years. Rather than trying to break up these companies, users could be given the statutory right of data portability, where a person can delete their account and take all of their personal data with them. Giving users greater control over their own information would be one way to give consumers more power without breaking up the companies they enjoy using on a regular basis.<br/>America Needs More Capitalism, Not Less<br/>Ultimately, it's an odd time to rail against American capitalism. Unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since 1969, and worker wages are on the rise. Capitalism, including big business, is a source of economic prosperity for American workers and families.<br/>Rather than weaponizing antitrust prosecutions for political or social purposes, policymakers should eliminate the anti-competitive privileges of crony capitalism. Concerns about data privacy are real but can be addressed with focused remedies rather than the blunt tool of \"breaking up big tech.\"<br/>Americans are not at the mercy of businesses that don't share their values.<br/>Americans are not at the mercy of businesses that don't share their values. Like Tucker Carlson, we are free to start a competing business, or we can simply choose another supplier. By contrast, we can't \"log out\" of laws and regulations-even ones we disagree with. Violating federal law or disobeying the instructions of a law enforcement officer can come with severe and sometimes deadly consequences.<br/>Our Founders wisely recognized that our greatest threat isn't Nabisco or Facebook. With the memory of an overreaching British monarch fresh in their minds, they sought to establish a republic that ensured government-not private business-was properly constrained. We ignore their wisdom at our own peril.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-69280</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM2-FH21-F03R-W14F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 FEE, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foundation For Economic Education</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While laws and law enforcement are essential in a free and orderly society, government abuse at all levels has riddled our history (from FDR's internment camps to Jim Crow laws in the South) and is the stuff of daily headlines. Government has the legal authority to incarcerate you, allocate your tax dollars how it sees fit, and foreclose on your home if you fail to mow the lawn[5]. You may recall the Supreme Court case[6] Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission involving Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop. Phillips was asked by a same-sex couple to create a wedding cake for their upcoming ceremony. Jack politely refused. A complaint was filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which led to a years-long struggle for Jack as he sought to protect his business, his brand, and his reputation. Even though the Supreme Court ultimately sided with Jack, the state of Colorado sought to punish him for exercising his freedom of speech and association.Where Is the Evidence of Corporations Threatening Freedom?Much of the nationalist right's recent lambasting of big business seems focused on social media[7]. A few media personalities like Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos[8] have been de-platformed for violating terms of service or community standards, but where is the widescale conservative or nationalist purge? Even when users from the right have been suspended 'permanently,' social media has reversed course and reinstated[9] their accounts, sometimes within 48 hours. (Ask your attorney if you can appeal a conviction or civil judgment brought by the government within 48 hours.) The reality is that no person has a constitutional or natural right to a social media account. The reality is that no person has a constitutional or natural right to a social media account. A user must agree to the terms of service and comply with community standards to enjoy the services offered by these platforms. No user can compel Facebook or Twitter to tolerate what it deems hateful or offensive language any more than they can compel Fox News to give airtime to pro-Antifa screeds. Where else is big business threatening conservatives' freedom? Are banks refusing mortgages to conservatives? Are hospitals refusing to treat them? Are auto dealers refusing to sell F150s to boomers because of MAGA memes? Certainly, there are unfortunate stories of well-known conservatives being refused service at local restaurants, but the multi-year investigation into the IRS's unfair treatment of conservative groups reveals where the greater threat lies.'Big Business Hates Your Family'Carlson's speech at the conference was titled[10] 'Big Business Hates Your Family.' While Carlson has railed[11] against American companies for any number of reasons in recent years, his latest bte noire is Oreo. Nabisco, a parent company of Oreo, was in Carlson's crosshairs for advertising that suggests kids 'choose their pronoun'[12] with their Pride Month 'pronoun pack' cookies. Tucker dismissed the idea that people can start their own competing business if they don't like a company's practices. This dismissal of entrepreneurship is puzzling coming from an entrepreneur; Carlson is the co-founder of an online publisher. But there is an even simpler course of action than starting your own cookie company. If you are not happy with Nabisco's business practices, buy different cookies or bake your own at home with your family. It's not clear what policy Carlson would suggest in response to Oreo, but Carlson's characterization of big companies as monopolies may give a clue.Use a Scalpel, Not a SledgehammerCarlson has blasted social media giants as 'digital monopolies.'The big digital monopolies demand that we conform to their worldview and shut us down when we dissent. They have too much power. They are are threat to this country. Congress is doing nothing about it. It's time to complain, while we still can. #Tucker[13] @FoxNews[14]\u2014 Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) April 27, 2018[15]Despite the national media celebrity's histrionics, there are dozens of social media platforms and search engines. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram might be the most popular for now, but if a conservative doesn't like these companies' policies, they can unplug, deactivate their account, or try other emerging platforms like Codias, MeWe, Ricochet, or an alternative search engine like DuckDuckGo. Decrying social media companies as monopolies suggests that the companies should be broken up under antitrust laws.[16] However, the Federal Trade Commission enforces antitrust laws where there's a showing of anti-competitive practices[17]. It isn't enough to say that a company is too large or the company's practices are not pleasing to pundits like Carlson. Giving users greater control over their own information would be one way to give consumers more power without breaking up the companies. If companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook engage in anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing or exclusionary contracts, they should be forced to comply with applicable law like any other company. But rather than fearmongering that these companies are a greater threat to freedom than the government, we should narrowly tailor a remedy. For instance, these tech companies' greatest competitive advantage is that they have collected extensive data over the years. Rather than trying to break up these companies, users could be given the statutory right of data portability[18], where a person can delete their account and take all of their personal data with them. Giving users greater control over their own information would be one way to give consumers more power without breaking up the companies they enjoy using on a regular basis.America Needs More Capitalism, Not LessUltimately, it's an odd time to rail against American capitalism. Unemployment has dropped to its lowest[19] level since 1969, and worker wages are on the rise[20]. Capitalism, including big business, is a source of economic prosperity for American workers and families. Rather than weaponizing antitrust prosecutions for political or social purposes, policymakers should eliminate the anti-competitive privileges of crony capitalism. Concerns about data privacy are real but can be addressed with focused remedies rather than the blunt tool of 'breaking up big tech.' Americans are not at the mercy of businesses that don't share their values. Americans are not at the mercy of businesses that don't share their values. Like Tucker Carlson, we are free to start a competing business, or we can simply choose another supplier. By contrast, we can't 'log out' of laws and regulations\u2014even ones we disagree with. Violating federal law or disobeying the instructions of a law enforcement officer can come with severe and sometimes deadly consequences[21]. Our Founders wisely recognized that our greatest threat isn't Nabisco or Facebook. With the memory of an overreaching British monarch fresh in their minds, they sought to establish a republic that ensured government\u2014not private business\u2014was properly constrained. We ignore their wisdom at our own peril.

Just minutes ago, the White House released a letter saying the president is inclined to declassify that Democratic committee memo and will work with the House Intelligence Committee to see if they can come up with a releasable version of it, much redacted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that is not the only breaking news tonight. There is a lot more. The Russia story has suddenly become an FBI story and it's moving faster than anyone anticipated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just a year ago, all the smart people were mocking Donald Trump for being insane enough to suggest the Obama administration had surveilled or, as he put it, wiretapped his campaign. What a paranoid lunatic, they said. Get off Twitter.</p><p>Yes, now we know what actually happened. The question, at this point is, how many people in Trump's orbit weren't spied on by the FBI? Trump advisor Carter Page was placed under government surveillance in the fall of 2016 after the feds used uncorroborated claims from the Trump dossier to justify a FISA warrant.</p><p>We know from congressional testimony that Page spoke with Trump advisor, Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon while he was being spied on. Meaning that Bannon was likely spied on, too.</p><p>Tonight, based on our own reporting, we can tell you that Carter Page also sent email messages to members of the Trump campaign during that same period. Presumably, the FBI intercepted those as well. Suddenly, it looks like the Obama administration may have spied on a significant portion of the Trump campaign team.</p><p>Just how many people were surveilled and to what extent? How much did President Obama know about it? We still don't have the answers to those questions. Though we definitely have the right to them.</p><p>Oh, no, we don't, say Democrats. Asking questions is a sign of disloyalty to this country. The very people who once told us that spying absolutely never happened are now telling us that spying was perfectly justified and normal. Why? Because Russia.</p><p>OK. But the funny thing is almost all of the Russian collusion evidence unearthed recently implicates Democrats. Not the Trump campaign. Yesterday, we learned that, for example, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was secretly sending text messages to a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch in the hope of making contact with the dossier author Christopher Steele.</p><p>Warner tried to hide that correspondence. I'd \"rather not have a paper trail,\" he texted to the oligarch's lobbyist.</p><p>Now, traditionally, Washington, anyway, no paper trail is not an indicator of transparency. In fact, it's a sign of wrongdoing.</p><p>Now, we are not saying that Sen. Warner ought to resign his seat and face treason charges and we are not saying that because we are not hysterical liberals willing to poison our international relations and misuse the justice system just for cheap political ends. But we do think that Warner's behavior is worth knowing more about.</p><p>And so, by the way, is a remarkable new \"New York Times\" story just published about 40 minutes ago. That story alleges that, within the last year, American intelligence agencies paid a spy, apparently a spy working for the Russian government, $100,000 in American tax dollars in exchange for unverified and possibly fabricated information about President Trump.</p><p>Now, why would our intelligence agencies use our money to do something like that? Why would they do anything like that under any circumstances. And, by the way, what was the information they gathered used for?</p><p>None of that is clear at this hour. Here's what is clear right now. The bottom line in what we've learned this whole week, the one thing worth taking away from a dramatic week in Washington is this, the Obama administration spied on a rival political campaign. There had better be a legitimate reason for doing that. But, increasingly, it looks like there wasn't.</p><p>Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us with more on that Russia intel story. Ed?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tucker, this is just breaking this hour. \"The New York Times\" reporting that a shadowy Russian tricked American spies actually out of 100 grand last year.</p><p>They promised not just information on Donald Trump, but to deliver stolen national security agency cyber weapons in a deal that this shadowy Russian insisted would also include, yes, compromising material on the president. Sounds like a spy novel.</p><p>The NSA has been devastated by losing these secret hacking tools. So, they delivered the cash in a suitcase to a Berlin hotel room in September. Supposed to be the first installment of a million-dollar payout.</p><p>Here's the kicker. The Russian claimed the information would link the president and his associates to Russia. But, instead of providing the hacking tools, the Russian produced unverified and possibly fabricated information involving Mr. Trump and others. Bank records, emails, purported Russian intelligence data. Sounds a little bit like the Steele dossier.</p><p>Several US intel officials tell us tonight they made clear they did not want the Trump material from the Russians. They are insisting they never wanted this. He was suspected of having murky ties to Russian intel and to Eastern European cyber criminals. That's what they tell \"The New York Times\". But it sounds like US intel officials are spinning after the fact because they were in negotiations.</p><p>The NSA even used its official Twitter account nearly a dozen times to send out coded messages to this Russian. The Russian's eagerness to sell the Trump dirt raised suspicion among American spies because it was part of an operation to feed the information out into the United States intelligence community and pit US intel officials against Mr. Trump.</p><p>It was confusing because, at one point, this Russian dropped his asking price from $10 million to just over $1 million. That raised alarm bells.</p><p>Then he showed a 15-second clip of a video showing a man in a room talking to two women. He claimed it was Mr. Trump. But there was really no way to confirm that it was Mr. Trump with two women. It was a grainy video. It had no audio. And we are told that these officials were shown the video in the Russian embassy in Berlin.</p><p>So, this does sound like a spy novel. And as you were just saying, the president some time ago was suggesting that some US intel officials were out to get him. People said this is crazy. That wouldn't happen.</p><p>But now \"The Times\" is reporting tonight a remarkable story suggesting that they were willing to pay a million dollars to potentially get dirt on the president. US Intelligence officials.</p><p>They gave $100,000, the first installment, and the shadowy Russian took the money, went away without any dirt on the president. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Pretty unbelievable. Actually shocking. Very badly written story. But you, I thought, summarized it very well.</p><p>Philippe Reines was a longtime advisor to Hillary Clinton, was deputy assistant secretary of state under Obama and he joins us tonight. Philippe, thanks for coming on.</p><p>PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've just got to ask you, to the extent you know about this story that just broke, but the bottom line is our intelligence community paid $100,000 to apparently a Russian agent for salacious information of sexual nature, unverified, likely false, about President Trump. That doesn't seem standard.</p><p>REINES: Well, you know what? I think it's a couple things on why it does sound like a spy novel. Unfortunately, it's nonfiction. It's what we are living through.</p><p>I think the intelligence agencies often have to pay people who are not great to get information. We paid $8 million to find out who the worst spy in FBI history was, Robert Hanssen. I think we paid $25 million to locate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. For sure. And I'm glad that we did.</p><p>REINES: I'm glad, too. But I think this is an example of it working because I don't know when this is from, but you know what, you haven't heard about it, and that's because it was debunked, exactly as Ed was saying.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I don't know. Look, there is a lot that we don't know and I don't want to presume anything ever. But the bottom line is, our government paid $100,000 of our money to buy fake salacious material about the president. What would be the national security reason for doing that?</p><p>REINES: I think the bottom line is that the president's campaign was stocked with people, starting with Carter Page, who, by the way, was under FBI surveillance going back to 2013. Nothing to do with the president's campaign.</p><p>His contacts warranted multiple surveillance warrants. Starting on October of 2016, four more times. And mind you, do the math. Four more times takes you into the Trump administration.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm aware of that. And you, like a lot of people who have abandoned concerns about civil liberties, are assuming that because someone is under surveillance, he has done something wrong, whereas I would argue that the onus is on the government to explain why you are spying on Americans.</p><p>REINES: I think most people agree with you. I certainly agree with you and the FISA court has a very high bar.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it actually doesn't. And we know that because almost no applications for FISA warrants are ever turned down.</p><p>REINES: But there are very few ever made because everyone knows -</p><p>CARLSON: OK. This is the chicken and the egg. But the truth is they are almost never turned down. And we know that, in this case, the dossier was the backbone of the request. It was the first thing in the request. We do know that.</p><p>And we know that the dossier by the FBI's own description was a flakey document, whose contents they could not verify.</p><p>So, look, here's the bottom line. Does it bother you - if I said during the Obama administration that the Bush administration during the campaign had spied on a bunch of members of Obama's campaign team.</p><p>REINES: Not that they were suspected of Russian agents.</p><p>CARLSON: But what if a year-and-a-half later, there was no evidence that they were Russian agents? Would you say, well, geez, before you spy on a rival political campaign using the FBI, you better be sure you've got good reason.</p><p>REINES: That is an interesting argument. Is Carter Page part of the Trump campaign or not? You'd make it sound like he was the running mate, except when it comes to his contacts -</p><p>CARLSON: He didn't have anything to do with the Trump campaign.</p><p>REINES: So, it's not looking at the Trump campaign.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. Here's the point. Look, Carter Page - this show exclusively learned today - emailed a number of people on the Trump campaign.</p><p>REINES: That's called surveillance.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. And so, if you are surveying Carter Page who never got paid - he says he never met Trump, Trump says he never met him, whatever. I wasn't there, but that's what we know about it. I don't think he was integral to the campaign. But he had contact with people on the campaign.</p><p>And all of his conversations, both written and verbal, were being surveilled by the federal government.</p><p>REINES: That's what surveillance is. (INAUDIBLE) of what you're doing. He's probably talking to his dentist too.</p><p>CARLSON: But what this means is the Obama administration is spying on the Trump campaign.</p><p>REINES: No. They are not.</p><p>CARLSON: They actually literally were.</p><p>REINES: The Obama administration thankfully took this very seriously. They went and got a warrant on someone. The warrant was based on George Papadopoulos. The dossier was part of the warrant, but the warrant was primarily -</p><p>CARLSON: That's not true. That's not true.</p><p>But the point is, I'm just saying. Let's be totally honest here. The Obama administration spying on the Trump campaign, maybe there is an awesome reason for it, no one has explained that yet. But you assume that it's totally fine. You would not assume it was totally fine it was flipped around, would you?</p><p>REINES: I would assume - I happen to trust our government. I know that these days that's not a very savvy thing to say.</p><p>CARLSON: I've always trusted our government.</p><p>REINES: I trust it whether it's President Bush or President Obama. FISA started in earnest after 9/11. And I think we all learned that it was important. And if American citizens are, in some way, acting as a foreign agent, then they are fair game. I'm sorry they are fair game.</p><p>CARLSON: But you have to prove that they are and they didn't. And by the way, there is no reason based on everything we have learned in the past couple of weeks to have child-like faith in our intelligence agencies. And I don't think it's a good idea.</p><p>REINES: But bear in mind, with Carter Page, that it was renewed every 90 days three times. But it was renewed based on what happened in those 90 days.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's see the applications.</p><p>REINES: I'm happy for that. Unfortunately, I don't control it.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't either. Philippe, thank you.</p><p>REINES: No, thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Kim Strassel is on \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board. She follows the subject very closely and she joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Kim, I hate to hit with a story that's just come out because neither of us knows that much about it. But I just want your reaction since you cover this.</p><p>We learn in \"The New York Times\" piece 50 minutes ago that US intel agencies under the Trump administration paid 100 grand to get salacious information and apparently false information on Trump. Does that sound kind of just like normal business as usual to you?</p><p>REINES: No. It does not. Because as was just noted, it's one thing to go out and spend money potentially getting information on a sworn enemy of the United States. It's another to go out and spend $100,000 trying to get information on the commander-in-chief.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, presumably - according to \"The Times\" piece, it wasn't information that suggested he was selling secrets to anybody. It was information of a sexual nature that's probably not even true. But like it's also irrelevant to American national security.</p><p>Let me ask you this. Do you find it striking that the very people who a year ago said anyone who claims Trump was spied on by the Obama administration is a nutcase or Alex Jones or whatever tinfoil hat type. Those same people are now telling us, like, yes, of course, it's totally normal for one administration to spy on a rival presidential campaign. Like, no big deal.</p><p>STRASSEL: This is the story of this entire investigation, Tucker. Think back. First, we are told that the dossier was a creation of Republican funder. Turns out it was the Clinton campaign and the DNC.</p><p>Then we are told that it couldn't possibly have been used as part of a FISA warrant. Turns out it was. Then we are told it couldn't have made a big part of it. It turns out it was the main piece.</p><p>Now, we are told, well, it doesn't really matter because it wasn't really spying on the Trump campaign. It was spying on a man who had already left the campaign. Only that's not true either. It turns out it was used to end up following the conversations of Carter Page and whomever else he might have been talking to.</p><p>Steve Bannon, who has been mentioned, is potentially only one. There could be many other people that they managed to capture because of this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, how can - I mean, it seems to me it's critical in order to restore faith in government that we know the details here. Or else, in the vacuum created by ignorance, conspiracy theories grow. So, like, how do we get to the bottom of what actually happened?</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, look, for instance, at what happened when Sen. Grassley put out a less redacted version of his referral letter of a criminal investigation of Christopher Steele. You know, we were told none of that could come out, it would damage sources, methods, highly classified.</p><p>You look at it and you find out that the only thing that was, in fact, redacted was information that was highly scandalous and hurtful to the FBI that undermined it and the Justice Department.</p><p>So, my question is, why shouldn't we put out these FISA applications? Let's put out all the documents and see where the skeletons are. And, yes, we can try to be careful of sources and methods. But this has now become a force of he said, she said. And the American public deserves to see it and judge it with their own eyes.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. The embarrassment of federal bureaucrats is not justification for keeping something secret. It doesn't belong to them. They don't own these documents. They belong to us.</p><p>So, Kim Strassel, thanks for reminding of us of all that. It was great.</p><p>STRASSEL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Trump administration planning to enforce laws that keep immigrants off welfare. Those laws have been on the books for a long time. Of course, progressives are outraged. As always. That story next.</p><p>CARLSON: Federal law has long stipulated that immigrants cannot arrive in the United States and receive permanent residency if they become \"public charges\" who depend upon welfare. Of course, we spend decades learning that the government treats immigration law as strictly optional.</p><p>The Trump administration is looking to change that. The administration is drafting a new regulation that would penalize immigrants for receiving welfare programs like food stamps, Section 8, Head Start and CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. The left, of course, is howling.</p><p>Jose Aristimuno is a former press secretary for the Democratic National Committee and he joins us tonight. Jose, thanks for coming on.</p><p>JOSE ARISTIMUNO, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE FORMER PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what I find so interesting about the complaints here is that we know - I know from doing the show every night and speaking to immigration advocates that there are no immigrants on welfare. They are the most impressive people in our society. Add the most to our economy. They're the hardest working. None of them is a drain on the system.</p><p>And so, given that - I think you told me that too. Who cares if it's illegal for them to go on welfare? Why would they be on welfare if they are adding so much to our economy?</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: This is the issue, Tucker. And it's this. We shouldn't be punishing immigrants, legal immigrants, right, who pay taxes into our economy. Number one, if they are paying taxes, they should be able to have benefits of social programs such as Head Start. So, we are now going to punish.</p><p>CARLSON: Why? Why should they?</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Let me tell you. We are now going to punish, US children, right, who were born in this country, we are not going to allow them to go into Head Start because parents, right, illegal immigrants, are not going to want to put him in programs like Head Start because they're going to be afraid that they're going to be deported.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But, look, it's really simple. I'm sure that there are lot of immigrants who want these programs. I get it, they will be unhappy with it. But the point is pleasing American citizens since it's our country, not theirs.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: These children are US citizens.</p><p>CARLSON: That's great. OK. But the truth is, we can probably figure out how to do that for the children. But I'm not talking - I mean, you are picking a tiny percentage of this.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: But it's an important percentage.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, OK. Fine. Let's figure out a fix. But most immigrant families are on welfare. This is one of the things that advocates like you never admit when they're lecturing us that they're so much more impressive than you are. Most are.</p><p>And if you break it down by country, the last numbers I have from 2009, the federal numbers, but some countries like 70 percent of the immigrants are on welfare. So, why would you be in favor of that if you are an American citizen? Bringing people in and putting them right on benefits. That is not the American dream that we hear about at all.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Look, the immigration system in the United States is clearly broken. If you want to come and apply the legal way in the United States, you already go under a bunch of tests that define if you are going to be a public charge.</p><p>If you are go going to come into the United States, you should not be a public charge. You and I agree on that. But I think what the president is doing wrong he is expanding the tests. He's making it even harder for immigrants.</p><p>CARLSON: Here are the numbers. Maybe it will change your mind on this. OK, this is from the current population survey from March 2010, OK? Here are the numbers from Mexico. Mexico is the country that sends the most immigrants to the United States. By far.</p><p>Seventy-four-point-seven percent, as of 2009, immigrants from Mexico are on some form of welfare in the United States. Round up. That's 75% of all immigrants from Mexico are on some kind of welfare. That's ridiculous. And I think you just said you agreed that that was ridiculous.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: We can change that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why not just fix that right now and say, look, if you want to be here and add to the sum total of the economy, great. But you can't come and go on our social programs. You can't have open borders and a welfare state, right?</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Look, you and I agree on that. This is the issue. US citizen children are being punished because of this regulation coming into place.</p><p>CARLSON: Then take - leave everyone, just let the kids get go to on Head Start, which, by the way, has never been shown to work in 50 years. So, I'm not even sure you'd want that. Honestly.</p><p>But whatever. Let's just talk about the real problem, which is the majority of immigrants are on welfare. Why would any country put up with that and why would the left defend it? I'm totally confused.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: We are a country of laws and we are a country of immigrants. A majority of immigrants in this country are not criminals. You know that.</p><p>CARLSON: But I'm not saying they are criminals. I'm not saying the majority are criminals. I'm saying, the majority are on welfare. And that's not healthy. Because the whole idea is you move here and you take advantage of the opportunities.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: We are now going to make it harder for them to assimilate into the country. That doesn't make any sense.</p><p>CARLSON: Going on welfare is not assimilation. Going on welfare is dependency. Look, some of the people need to go on welfare. We've got a lot of Americans on welfare.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would we import people from other countries on welfare. That's insane, isn't it?</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: I understand what you are getting at. But the problem is that the regulations that the president wants to put forth are not doing the point that you're trying to make. The point that we are trying to make as Democrats, the majority of Democrats is that children are being punished.</p><p>And guess what? We're now going to punish immigrants because they are poor?</p><p>CARLSON: What do you mean punish them because they are poor? They are coming to our country. It's not their country.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: In search of a better life.</p><p>CARLSON: In search of a better life and then going on our welfare programs? Are you joking? This is not the bring us your poor, tired, huddled masses that we're told about where people come here and work their way up and run a tech company in Silicon Valley. This is like the opposite of what we want.</p><p>I think you would agree, but you are defending it for some reason. I don't know why.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Because it's coming from a bad place. The regulations are coming from an anti-immigrant racist agenda that the president has put forth.</p><p>CARLSON: You know what? When you guys have nothing left to say, you just, oh, it's race. If you don't give us everything we want, you are racist.</p><p>I really kind of want to move to, like, Mexico and start accusing the authorities there of racism because they are not giving me free stuff. Seriously.</p><p>I'm talking about a president that has talked about people -</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care what the president - I'm an American.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Well, he's the president of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I have a right to have some say, every American citizen does -</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: We all do, right.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. And, like, this is insane. It's not about whether the president is a racist or not. That's not a real answer, is it?</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: So, the answer is let's end chain migration, as you guys like to call it, right? Let's end the visa lottery.</p><p>CARLSON: No. Let's just have control over who comes here.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: Let's destroy the legal immigration system, right, and deport 11 million people. Is that what we want to do?</p><p>CARLSON: I think we should have control of who lives here. I mean it. Why wouldn't you? We are a country. And if that means deporting who shouldn't be here, that's our right.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: You and I agree on that.</p><p>CARLSON: No, you don't. You don't. You are not being honest. I'm sorry. You don't agree because you argue Trump is a racist. OK.</p><p>ARISTIMUNO: He is.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, whatever. Thanks, Jose. Appreciate it.</p><p>George Soros was at Davos. Soros, Davos, try to read that in a script. Two weeks ago, he blasted tech companies for hurting the world. He is right about that. But there are other problems. And we'll tell you what they are.</p><p>Of course, we will continue to follow tonight's breaking news. The White House says the president intends to release the Democratic FBI memo, but needs to work with the intel committee on edits. We will continue to follow that story and tell you what's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" over on \"CBS\", New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says that, even though, she recently denounced Bill Clinton as a sexual predator, his wife, Hillary Clinton somehow remains her greatest political role model, which is confusing, which is why we called Tammy Bruce, the New York radio show host, to sort it all out for us. And she joins us tonight.</p><p>Tammy, what does that mean?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, NEW YORK RADIO SHOW HOST: It means that, obviously, Kirsten Gillibrand doesn't know what she is talking about or she's operating exclusively politically.</p><p>Look, Hillary Clinton is the enabler of Bill Clinton. She is, of course, now we know revealed as someone who protected a sexual harasser and disrupted the work life of the victim in order to shield that individual. It's a remarkable admission.</p><p>And, yet, of course, it's completely political. If Kirsten Gillibrand cared about the issues, she couldn't even really associate with the Clintons. She is denying in this interview coming up, by the way, Tucker.</p><p>She's asked if she's spoken to the Clintons. She wouldn't answer that, but then that's when she said she admired Hillary Clinton. So, it's very strange. She doesn't want to say that she is speaking to them, but that she needs to be able to at least give her some compliments.</p><p>It could be that there is no leadership in the Democratic Party and Kirsten is wondering what kind of national base could she latch on to for this. So, that probably is part of it.</p><p>But I think she should be careful about being seen as a public face of the #MeToo movement, which now is becoming completely politicized, and I think that's bad news for that movement.</p><p>CARLSON: So, she, obviously, thinks she is going to be president. She is running for president. This interview is part of the PR preparatory to that. It seems like maybe everyone running for president should take at least one lesson from the Trump campaign, which is voters will put up with a lot if they think you are just being honest.</p><p>BRUCE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: That phoniness is transparent. Everyone likes it, nobody appreciates it. Why hasn't she learned that? It just seems so false to me.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, I think it's because there are bubbles. Look, she's a New York Democrat. She might not even see herself as president, but perhaps as vice president. So, she is setting herself up to move beyond.</p><p>Clearly, the Democrats are deluded. If their leadership are the Clintons, no wonder they are in trouble. And she sees that somehow this is some way to move herself ahead of the game.</p><p>In California, there is a democrat, a woman who is also the face of the #MeToo movement who has now taken leave because of sexual harassment allegations against her by men. So, we're looking at a very unique dynamic. But I think the American people see through it and I think Kirsten Gillibrand is in for a little bit of a wake-up call coming up.</p><p>CARLSON: The irony alarm just goes off in the back. Tammy Bruce, great to see you. Have the best weekend.</p><p>BRUCE: My pleasure. Thank you, dear.</p><p>CARLSON: Billionaire and far-left patron George Soros was in Davos last week, of course. He was talking. And he called the big tech companies like Google and Facebook a menace to society. He is right about that.</p><p>But then, he kept going. He said the current administration in Washington is not just bad for the country, it's an existential threat to civilization itself. Civilization itself.</p><p>Steve Hilton hosts \"The Next Revolution\" here on \"Fox 9\" every Sunday night. Fantastic show. He does not agree with this assessment. And he joins us tonight from California. Hey, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, \"FOX 9\" HOST, \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\": It's just so laughable. Look, we both agree with Soros that the tech companies are a menace to society. But he forgot to tell us that he invested in the tech companies. It is so laughable.</p><p>The things he said were so offensive to me - I can get away with this because I, like George Soros, am a Hungarian. So, I can call him a Hungarian hypocrite. Not just for the fact that he criticizes the tech companies while investing in them, he went on about gambling.</p><p>While back in the UK when I got my start in politics, he made his billions gambling in the foreign exchange markets which crashed the economy and caused untold misery for millions of people.</p><p>But when it comes to this question of the open society that he argues Donald Trump is wrecking, he really should know better because he and I share experience of that.</p><p>Communism in Hungary, that's a real attack on the open society. It's so disgusting for him to make that comparison.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it is disgusting. But it's of a peace with his behavior over decades as just you pointed out. But since you follow this guy pretty closely, and I think you are great at big-picture things, we just learned that he is paying - giving campaign money to district attorney races around the country. And he's doing a lot of other things. What ties them all together? What's is his vision? What does he want for America? What's the point of all this?</p><p>HILTON: I think he - you know what I really think is the simple answer to that? I think it's guilt. I think he is guilty at the way he's made his money, gambling in the casino of the financial markets. And he is trying to atone for that.</p><p>A lot of the liberal elite are exactly in that position. And again, it comes to hypocrisy. The Hungarian hypocrite. He, like all the other liberal elite, jump up and down and go on about dark money in politics and the evil Koch Brothers, and yet he is doing exactly this.</p><p>It's not that he is supporting this particular candidate in these rather obscure around the country, he's actually effectively covering it up. Those donations are not made public to the electorate before the election.</p><p>CARLSON: Good point.</p><p>HILTON: And this is exactly the kind of corruption in politics that the rest of the time they love to condemn. I took a look, by the way, Tucker. The candidate certainly didn't want to recognize the contribution of her big benefactor.</p><p>She said thank you to a lot of people after her campaign. Someone called Sherri Murphy (ph), your help was major. Her local progress family, the EO network (ph), whatever that is. And even, wait for it, Tucker, your favorite publication, \"Teen Vogue\". This candidate thanks \"Teen Vogue\", but not George Soros who basically handed her her position on a plate.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. Everything that Soros pays for in this country makes America weaker and more divided. That seems to be a connection to me. Steve Hilton, great to see you.</p><p>Steve's show, \"The Revolution\", every Sunday night 9 p.m. Eastern. I watch it. You should too.</p><p>America is a depressed country. Tens of millions of Americans are taking pills for depression. Is it working? Is there another way? We'll meet an author of a brand-new book, who says there is. Really interesting conversation. Just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: The president has announced his choice for the nation's next drug czar. His name is Jim Carroll. He's currently White House deputy chief of staff. He will be leaving to direct the office of national drug control policy. He suddenly has grave significance in the middle of this nation's worst drug epidemic.</p><p>The move, another departure from Trump's West Wing in the wake of staff secretary Rob Porter's resignation earlier this week.</p><p>Antidepressants are more popular than ever in this country. Virtually ubiquitous. According to CDC report last year, about 1 in 8 Americans reported recent antidepressant use. And yet, the nation's suicide rate has surged and the country doesn't seem to be that much happier than countries than countries that have fewer drugs in circulation.</p><p>That raises the question, are we thinking about depression in the wrong way. the author of \"Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions\". A book that unexpectedly has become the center of a lot of debates and has sold quite well. He joins us tonight. Johann, thanks for coming on.</p><p>JOHANN HARI, AUTHOR, \"LOST CONNECTIONS: UNCOVERING THE REAL CAUSES OF DEPRESSION - AND THE UNEXPECTED SOLUTIONS\": Hi, Tucker. It's great to be with you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this book has been very controversial, I think, in the best way, in that it's forced a conversation where there should have been one years ago.</p><p>But summarize for us, if you could, crisply, what is the case that you are making about antidepressants.</p><p>HARI: Yes. Most of the book is not about antidepressants. It's about why we are in such pain in the first place.</p><p>And I think that everyone watching the show knows that they have natural physical needs, right? You need water, you need food, you need shelter. If I took them away from you, you'd be in real trouble real fast.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HARI: There's equally strong evidence that human beings have natural psychological needs. Overwhelming evidence. You've got to feel you belong. You've got to feel your life has meaning and purpose. You've got to feel that people see you and value you. You've got to feel that there is a future that makes sense to you.</p><p>And our culture is good at lots of things. But there's very strong evidence we have been getting less and less good at meeting people's deep underlying psychological needs. And that is one of the key drivers of this depression and anxiety crisis.</p><p>What we've been told up to now - when I was a teenager and I went to my doctor in a real sense of profound pain, my doctor said - told me a totally biological story about why I was depressed. He was just due to a chemical imbalance in my brain.</p><p>And I drugged myself for 13 years. I remained depressed. There are other people who've taken antidepressants who do experience benefit.</p><p>But one of the things that was so striking to me when I went and traveled all over the world and to meet the leading experts in the world about what really causes depression and anxiety and what really solves them is that, overwhelmingly, it's due to responses - it's a response to key factors in how we're living.</p><p>I learned the scientific evidence -</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm just laughing because it seems so obviously.</p><p>HARI: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why have we been telling ourselves that it is mysterious chemical imbalance. Those do exist, of course. But for the overwhelming majority, maybe it has to do with the way that we are living, is making us unhappy.</p><p>HARI: Yes. If you are depressed and anxious, you are not crazy. You are not a machine with broken parts. You are a human being with unmet needs.</p><p>So, that can sound a bit strange in the abstract. So, I'll give you an obvious example that connects people immediately. There's a study that asks the average American how many close friends do you have that you could call on a crisis.</p><p>And when they started doing years ago, the most common answer was five. Today, the most common answer is none. So, we are -</p><p>CARLSON: None?</p><p>HARI: It's not the average. It's the most common answer. So, we've become the loneliest society that's ever been.</p><p>And what I want to look was what are antidepressants for these nine deep underlying causes of depression and anxiety, what are the solutions to these problems? I'll give you an example to that one.</p><p>There is a doctor in East London called Sam Everington, had loads of patients coming to him acutely depressed and anxious. And he felt really uncomfortable because he had been told in his training, even though he knew the science was much more sophisticated, to say you've just got a chemical imbalance in your brain and just give them drugs.</p><p>Like me, he is not opposed to the drugs, but he could see this wasn't solving the problem. A lot of them, for example, were acutely lonely.</p><p>He did an experiment. A woman came to him called Lisa Cunningham. She'd been shut away in her home for seven years with really severe depression and anxiety.</p><p>He said, Lisa, I'll keep giving you the drugs, don't worry. I'm also going to prescribe something else. I'm going to prescribe for you to take part in a group. There was an area of scrub land behind the doctor's surgery. And he said, we'll come and support you, but I want you to meet with a group of depressed and anxious people twice a week. And we're going to turn this into a beautiful garden. They met over weeks and months.</p><p>As Lisa put it to me, as the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom. A study of a very similar program found it's more than twice as effective as chemical antidepressants.</p><p>What I learned all over the world is there are people who are trying anti- depressants that are about dealing with the deep social and psychological reasons why we feel so terrible in the first place.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the deeper question is - everything you said is so obvious to me. Reports are (ph) completely with our experience as people. We're are out of time, but maybe you can come back and explain why we vest so much unwarranted faith in psychiatrists. Why are we so willing to take bad advice from people with MDs.</p><p>HARI: We've only given those psychiatrists one lever to pull. So, in one way, you can't blame them for pulling it. But what we need to do as a society is put in place a much more expanded menu of options. Things that actually deal with these nine deep reasons why we feel so terrible in the first place. And those options exist. They've been tried all over the world. I've seen them. And they're reducing depression and anxiety. They give a lot of hope.</p><p>CARLSON: I believe you completely. The book is \"Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions.\" I'm reading the title, so people will buy it. I think it's great.</p><p>Johann, thank you.</p><p>HARI: Thank you so much, Tucker.</p><p>\"Final Exam\" is next. Have you been following the news more closely than our news professionals? You can find out in just a minute.</p><p>CARLSON: Time now for \"Final Exam\" where we pit two news professionals here at Fox against one another to determine who has been paying closer attention to the news of the past week.</p><p>Our three-time defending champion here for a fourth week Carley Shimkus, \"Fox News Headline 24/7\" reporter and contributor to \"Fox &amp; Friends.\" Her challenger this week, (INAUDIBLE) Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry.</p><p>HENRY: Big title.</p><p>CARLSON: Who was on the show last night in a very different context.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, \"FOX NEWS HEADLINE 24/7\" REPORTER: He is a heavyweight.</p><p>HENRY: Yes, literally.</p><p>CARLSON: He's smart. But we'll see. No one has been able to stop Carley so far.</p><p>OK. Put your hands on the buzzers. I'm going to go through the rules. You know what they are. I ask the questions. The first one to buzz in gets to answer. You have to wait until I finish the question in order to do that. Every correct answer is worth a point. Get it wrong, we subtract a point. Best of five wins.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I think we can handle that.</p><p>CARLSON: All right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We'll see.</p><p>CARLSON: Good luck.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: A 13-year-old went viral during Justin Timberlake's halftime show at the Super Bowl because he seemed very distracted. What was he doing? Ed Henry.</p><p>HENRY: He was on his phone. He took a selfie with Justin Timberlake, but there was something - he was watching a video and it broke down or something. So, he got teased.</p><p>CARLSON: That's a long answer. Does the tape -</p><p>HENRY: He was on \"Ellen\". I saw him on \"Ellen\".</p><p>CARLSON: We're going to roll the tape and find out.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Interesting information.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Meme of 13-year-old Ryan McKenna stealing the spotlight, poking fun at the teenager for staring at his phone too much while the pop star was right next to him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought the kid should have taken the selfie with Justin behind him and then put his phone down and enjoy the show. Just like what we all do. Everyone has got to have their phone and tape everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's a very unclear answer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: No. I dispute that.</p><p>CARLSON: But our judges are saying he got it.</p><p>HENRY: He was on his phone. He said on \"Ellen\" or \"Good Morning America\" that he was watching a video and said he got teased because the phone broke down.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you are watching both \"Ellen\" and \"Good Morning America\"?</p><p>HENRY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Let's talk later about that. OK.</p><p>SHIMKUS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: Question two, a world leader made news this week when he chastised a woman for using the phrase \"mankind\" which is a sexist phrase in his country. This leader recommends more inclusive terms like peoplekind. Who was it?</p><p>HENRY: Wait, she did it - he hadn't finished.</p><p>SHIMKUS: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: Judges? He finished says the judges.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That would be Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><p>CARLSON: Not, Justin Timberlake. Justin Trudeau.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Justin Trudeau. The other JT.</p><p>CARLSON: The other JT. Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\": Prime minister Justin Trudeau is really serious about making Canadians watch their language.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: We like to say peoplekind, not necessarily mankind. That's more inclusive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Very inclusive.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: He's an inclusive guy.</p><p>CARLSON: So, let me just say that our judges - look, I'm not sure why they make the decisions they do. But you don't ask those kind of questions. This is a very hierarchal show. The judges are in charge. Here we go, it's 1-1.</p><p>HENRY: Do you have certain number of challenges?</p><p>CARLSON: No, I don't. I never challenge. Question three, which 77-year- old lawmaker just set a record for the longest continuous speech in the history of the House of Representatives causing some of her colleagues to dozen off in their chairs? Carley Shimkus?</p><p>SHIMKUS: That would be Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>CARLSON: Nancy Pelosi. I don't think she is 77, but we'll find out. Check the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST, \"INGRAHAM ANGLE\": And Nancy Pelosi, oh, she punishes - I mean, promotes the Dreamers with a marathon 8-hour speech. Good for her. 4-inch heels, too. Lent has come early.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST, \"WATTERS WORLD\": Even Democrats aren't happy with the minority leader's performance. One of Nancy's colleagues fell asleep during the speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: That's understandable, right? Eight hours.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Our judges concede - sort of back end of this, can see the metrics, say that you buzzed in just milliseconds before your competitor.</p><p>HENRY: So, it doesn't count?</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. It does count. It does count.</p><p>HENRY: Wait. So, you could break the rules?</p><p>CARLSON: No, I was just complimenting for her (INAUDIBLE) reaction.</p><p>HENRY: But you can bend the rules. OK.</p><p>CARLSON: She is fast. All right. Question four, 2-1. Billionaire Elon Musk just launched a Tesla Roadster into space with an astronaut mannequin in the driver's seat because he can do literally whatever he wants.</p><p>The roadster has now gone off track and is headed for the asteroid belt. But what was its original destination? Ed Henry?</p><p>HENRY: Mars, the orbit around Mars.</p><p>CARLSON: Mars. The orbit around Mars. All right. Let's check the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And just for fun. The payload on this test flight was a brand new electric Tesla Roadster, which is now heading to the Mars orbit. Starman astronaut dummy in the driver's seat with three cameras to provide epic views.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That is correct. And by the way, our judges said they admired the precision with which you answered it. The Mars or the orbit around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Casting a wide net.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is the third week in a row that Carley has come to sudden death situation. Two-to=two. Winner of this takes the award, which has changed this week.</p><p>All right. Final question. Another example of tech changing everything. Best Buy, the company, announced this week that they would no longer be selling which music-related product?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>CARLSON: Ed Henry.</p><p>HENRY: CDs.</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, that's pretty authoritative.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That would make sense.</p><p>HENRY: It's not 8 tracks.</p><p>CARLSON: Let's check the tape. CDs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: According to a report in \"Billboard\", Best Buy has just told music suppliers that it will pull CDs from its stores come July 1st.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow! And there you go. Carley Shimkus.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let him have it. Such a nice guy.</p><p>CARLSON: If you are going to lose to someone, it should be Ed.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Ed. One era ends, another begins. We have a new prize. This is the Erik Wemple mug. This has a picture of Erik Wemple of \"The Washington Post\" guest on the show at one point. Here is what happened to him and then the back side is my triumphant face. The official Erik Wemple mug.</p><p>This is the very first day of it. Congratulations.</p><p>HENRY: Thank you. I will drink this with honor.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you both. That was great.</p><p>Pay attention all week. \"Final Exam\" is over now, but next week we'll be back and you can see if you can outwit our contestants. We will return in just a moment.</p><p>CARLSON: Two big stories breaking tonight. The FBI spent more than 100 grand of tax dollars chasing damaging information on Donald Trump. Instead simply handed money to a Russian scammer for what looks like fraudulent information. What?</p><p>Also, President Trump says he is willing to release that committee memo, the Democratic one, but he's going to work with the intel committee on alterations to it.</p><p>Here is something new. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is planning a series of votes on immigration next week. Rather than pushing a specific bill, he's planning to let every proposal offered get up or down vote. We'll be on it next week and we'll tell you how your lawmakers voted on that issue.</p><p>Have a great weekend. See you Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Mueller investigation appears to be moving in directions that nobody  could have anticipated, none of them obviously connected to Russian  meddling in the past presidential election. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So, what is the point of all of this? And when and where does it end, if  ever? Ken Starr and Joe diGenova join us in a moment on that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first tonight, freedom of speech. Lot of people voted for Donald Trump  in the hope that they would have more of it. But two years in, the opposite  has happened. A ruling class has clamped down, as never before, on personal  expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Gone is the free exchange of ideas we were promised. As Americans, it was  supposed to be our birthright, remember? But in its place now, mandatory  soul-deadening conformity, an entire population forced to repeat the same  mindless platitudes, or else.</p><p> An axis of Left-wing corporate power, academia, the media and lawmakers  have all aligned to curb your right to speak freely, which is to say your  right to think for yourself. When they control your words, they control  your mind.</p><p> The Left used to deny that that was their goal. They're not pretending  anymore. They're baring their teeth and snarling. Get in line or we'll hurt  you. </p><p> In a speech on Monday night, CEO Tim Cook pledged that Apple, one of the  biggest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, will do  whatever it takes to silence dissenting opinion.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TIMOTHY DONALD COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Hate tries to make its  headquarters in the digital world. At Apple, we believe that technology  needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to  get tied up in knots. That's why we only have one message for those who  seek to push hate, division, and violence, you have no place on our  platforms.</p><p> (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Hate, it's a real thing. There's a lot of it out there right now.  But hate is also the word they use for views they don't like or questions  they can't answer. </p><p> Cook's real message is simple. We are holy. You are fallen. Shut up and  obey. CEOs didn't used to talk like this. They were in the business of  selling products, not preaching sermons. </p><p> Then, over time, conventional religion receded from public life, and people  like Tim Cook and his fellow CEOs stepped forward to fill that void. It was  not an upgrade. Apple has a lot more power than the Episcopal Church ever  had, and much less humility, and much less restraint. </p><p> Leaders a 100 years ago could tolerate dissent. They thought God would sort  it out in the end. They didn't have to. Members of our modern ruling class  consider themselves God. They render their own judgment. They view  disagreement as equivalent to apostasy, an attack on the one true faith.</p><p> In New York, to name but one example, among many, a new bill in the state  legislature would ban anyone who says something politicians don't like from  buying a firearm. </p><p> Prospective gun owners will be required to give up their passwords and to  show their social media accounts to regulators who would inspect them for  unapproved thoughts. Sound like something that Chinese military thought up?  Yes, it does.</p><p> But Democrats are not apologizing for it. Listen to one of the sponsors of  the bill explain.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: If we make this  law and you have to, you know, allow the - you know, the state government  to, in fact, look at your social media posts, you can decide on whether you  want a pistol license or not. You don't have to have a pistol license.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: That's true. You don't. You don't have to vote either or go to  church of your choice or be tried by a jury of your peers. What other  constitutional rights will soon be contingent on saying the right things? </p><p> To find out, we've invited Kevin Parker on the show tonight. He is the New  York State Senator from Brooklyn, you just saw on that tape. Senator  Parker, welcome. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p> PARKER: Thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I should just say at the outset what I'm sure of you (ph) as  already know, which is it's already against federal law to sell firearms to  the mentally ill, thank heaven, and I think all of us support that  restriction. So, it's already against the law.</p><p> But what other constitutional rights that we, as Americans, possess should  be contingent on how we behave on social media?</p><p> PARKER: Well, let's be clear. I take an oath that supports the amendments  and - and the whole Constitution, both the U.S. and the--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PARKER: --the state government Constitution. And so, this is really not  about impinging on constitutional rights. This is really about safety. This  is really about how do we, in fact, make the State of New York as safe as  possible.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PARKER: Now, we've already been very safe. We're one of the - the top three  safest states in the entire country, particularly when you look at, you  know, - you know, mass shootings, thank God. </p><p> But we can always be safer, and we can always make sure that what happened  in Pittsburgh, what we saw in Parkland, what we saw in Orlando doesn't  happen here.</p><p> And so, this - this law simply says let's look at, you know, what people  are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a -  a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> PARKER: --because what we've--</p><p> CARLSON: Well but then - but - but - but hold on, but - but--</p><p> PARKER: --what we've--</p><p> CARLSON: --and, by the way, I agree with your desire to make your state and  - and every state as safe as - as we possibly can. But why restrict it to  gun owners? </p><p> I mean you are an elected official. You are a State Senator. You wield a  lot of power. You control people's lives. Why shouldn't I have the password  to your social media accounts, so we can assess whether you should be  wielding the power that you do?</p><p> PARKER: Well somebody (ph) should put that law and maybe we can - we could  do that. My, first of all, my social--</p><p> CARLSON: Well no, no, no, but no, but it's a--</p><p> PARKER: --my social media--</p><p> CARLSON: --sincere question. Would you send me - would you send me your  password?</p><p> PARKER: Tucker - Tucker, my social media is open right now. You can go on  it and look at it, anybody can look at it. It's public information.</p><p> CARLSON: I don't know. Why don't you-- </p><p> PARKER: So, people can look at--</p><p> CARLSON: --why don't you send but - but hold on--</p><p> PARKER: --at my social media.</p><p> CARLSON: --why don't you send me your passwords, and I'll find out how open  it really is.</p><p> PARKER: Well, again - again--</p><p> CARLSON: You're - you're requiring gun owners to give you their passwords.  Why shouldn't they turn around and ask you for the same? That's--</p><p> PARKER: Well, look--</p><p> CARLSON: --a sincere question.</p><p> PARKER: --look, what we should be talking about is how do we make the State  of New York safe? And I'm simply saying, right now, we're not as safe as we  can be, because people are saying things on social media, and we're not  using that--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> PARKER: --and looking at that as we, in fact, give out a weapon that can  that - that is used to kill people.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But I--</p><p> PARKER: Period (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --I - I - I get what you're saying. I guess I'm just wondering why  we're restricting. I mean as long as, and you've said that privacy is not a  concern, and if you have concerns about privacy, you know, don't - don't  carry a gun, don't buy a gun. </p><p> OK. But you're saying that that's the only category to which this applies.  Why don't we apply it to voting?</p><p> PARKER: Again--</p><p> CARLSON: Before you vote and choose who runs the state, who controls your  life, why shouldn't you have your social media checked? I'm not sure--</p><p> PARKER: Because--</p><p> CARLSON: --I understand.</p><p> PARKER: --because voting doesn't necessarily lead to people killing each  other. This is really about access to guns--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, of course, it does.</p><p> PARKER: --no, this is about access to guns. </p><p> CARLSON: Well no--</p><p> PARKER: And we know that there's a direct correlation with the number of  guns that are available in - in - in states, and the - the - the prevalence  of mass shootings. We also know--</p><p> CARLSON: Well we don't - we - we don't know--</p><p> PARKER: --we know that - we know that - we know that in the -  internationally (ph) as well--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just to let you know (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --we know that internationally (ph) as well.</p><p> CARLSON: --that's actually that's - that's not true. I think Wyoming has  the highest per capita gun ownership in the country. I don't think--</p><p> PARKER: Yes. Yes, with the five people--</p><p> CARLSON: --there were any mass shootings--</p><p> PARKER: --with the five people who live in Wyoming--</p><p> CARLSON: --in Wyoming (ph), right, OK--</p><p> PARKER: --and the guns that they have.</p><p> CARLSON: No. It - OK, but let me just (ph) say--</p><p> PARKER: But when you look at - when you look at--</p><p> CARLSON: --there is not a correlation--</p><p> PARKER: --when you look at--</p><p> CARLSON: --between those two things just in--</p><p> PARKER: --there's absolute - there's absolutely--</p><p> CARLSON: --just in point of fact (ph). </p><p> PARKER: --there's--</p><p> CARLSON: No, there's not, actually.</p><p> PARKER: --absolutely - there's - Tucker-- </p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> PARKER: --there absolutely is. And--</p><p> CARLSON: I mean look at social science center (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --we look at places like Japan--</p><p> CARLSON: --whatever, OK.</p><p> PARKER: --when we look at places like Japan and we look at--</p><p> CARLSON: But - but this is--</p><p> PARKER: --places like Australia, they have much lower gun violence--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. OK. So, but - but - but--</p><p> PARKER: --and - and especially mass shootings--</p><p> CARLSON: --but the question - the - the question here is--</p><p> PARKER: --exactly because they limit the number of--</p><p> CARLSON: --who decides--</p><p> PARKER: --guns that people have.</p><p> CARLSON: --who decides - no, but you're not calling for limiting the number  of guns in this bill. You're calling for people to turn over their social  media passwords, so you can decide whether they've said things that are  naughty. And if they have, they don't get to own a gun. </p><p> And so, my question is what other constitutional rights are dependent on  your approval? Is the right to abortion? Should we before allowing women to  have abortions check their social media accounts? Sincere question. And if  - if not, why not?</p><p> PARKER: Tucker, I'm really focusing on the issue of gun violence. There's  too much gun violence in our communities--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But you're--</p><p> PARKER: --too much gun violence in--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I can't - I--</p><p> PARKER: --in - across the country.</p><p> CARLSON: --look, I agree. I'm against gun violence --</p><p> PARKER: And it's really important that we--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK but--</p><p> PARKER: --that we get it down.</p><p> CARLSON: --but - but hold on, who's going to make this? I mean you're  obviously not--</p><p> PARKER: The state - New York State Police.</p><p> CARLSON: --engaged in--</p><p> PARKER: --The--</p><p> CARLSON: --the New York State Police.</p><p> PARKER: --New York State - the New York State Police.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but they'll just decide? Typically before we determine  someone is mentally ill, we adjudicate that person mentally ill. That's  the--</p><p> PARKER: This is - this is - this is not about mental illness.</p><p> CARLSON: --term we use.</p><p> PARKER: This is an addition to--</p><p> CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p> PARKER: --the other - in addition--</p><p> CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p> PARKER: --in addition to the other criteria that the New York State Police  will use and they already use to determine who should be eligible to get a  gun permit, in addition to that, what I'm saying is, we should also have  the State Police review the social media accounts of the people who--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. And take the passwords--</p><p> PARKER: --are making the requests.</p><p> CARLSON: --right. And so, on but what - what would cause this? So, the  State Police, independent of a judge, just get to decide whether you can  have a gun or not based on whether or not they like what you've said on  Facebook.</p><p> PARKER: Well the state - the state - the state--</p><p> CARLSON: And they--</p><p> PARKER: --legislature has the ability with - with the signature of the - of  the Governor to, in fact, make law. And so, we make it the law, we then  can, in fact, subscribe--</p><p> CARLSON: So then you turn over to the--</p><p> PARKER: --the power to the state--</p><p> CARLSON: --police--</p><p> PARKER: --to the state police to make a--</p><p> CARLSON: --you know, it's just - it's just--</p><p> PARKER: --determination--</p><p> CARLSON: --interesting, so you--</p><p> PARKER: --which they do all the time--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --by the way.</p><p> CARLSON: --oh, of course, they do like, yes, the police get to unilaterally  decide whether we can exercise our constitutional rights. You're  comfortable giving the--</p><p> PARKER: No, they're not--</p><p> CARLSON: --police that power.</p><p> PARKER: --unilaterally deciding. </p><p> CARLSON: I don't think you would--</p><p> PARKER: The state - the state legislature's-- </p><p> CARLSON: No.</p><p> PARKER: --actually deciding it--</p><p> CARLSON: The state legislature is handing over--</p><p> PARKER: --which the states are allowed (ph) the state--</p><p> CARLSON: --to them the power--</p><p> PARKER: --no, that's - that's, in fact--</p><p> CARLSON: --to their side (ph).</p><p> PARKER: --not done - exactly.</p><p> CARLSON: So, in every - oh? No, it's--</p><p> PARKER: What we - what we do (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --happening (ph), right.</p><p> PARKER: --but they already have that power right now.</p><p> CARLSON: Right. OK. So--</p><p> PARKER: At this very moment, the State Police decide who gets a gun--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK. Let me just (ph) ask you a human--</p><p> PARKER: --and who doesn't get a gun.</p><p> CARLSON: --question. Do you think it's a little intrusive that the  government would be forcing citizens to turn over their social media  passwords to the police before doing something that Constitution guarantees  them the right to? That doesn't bother you in any way? That doesn't seem a  little bit, say, totalitarian or something--</p><p> PARKER: Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --that maybe China would - would do.</p><p> PARKER: Tucker, we make legislation through a process. All the things that  you have objected to, there are lots of people who object to it. There's  conversations that are going on. Maybe all the--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But you're - you - I'm sorry. I can't--</p><p> PARKER: --but - I got it but may (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --let you third - skirt the third question in a row.</p><p> PARKER: I'm not - I'm not - I'm not skirting it. I'm saying--</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think it's a little bit--</p><p> PARKER: --what I'm saying to you that--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, it's a process. I'm--</p><p> PARKER: --there's an (ph) opportunity for-- </p><p> CARLSON: --I'm aware of how (ph) our government works.</p><p> PARKER: --and I - so there's a--</p><p> CARLSON: But I--</p><p> PARKER: --it's opportunity for us to work together to, in fact, look at  this. Maybe the passwords--</p><p> CARLSON: You're - you've written--</p><p> PARKER: --won't play in this (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --this bill.</p><p> PARKER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And these are your proposals.</p><p> PARKER: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: So, this is essentially (ph) something that you came up with. And  I'm just asking you, as you sat at your laptop and typed out, you will be  required to hand over your passwords to the State Police. And if they don't  like what you say, you don't get to exercise your rights.</p><p> PARKER: Right now--</p><p> CARLSON: So, part of you think, boy, that sounds--</p><p> PARKER: --you know, right (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --really Orwellian to me--</p><p> PARKER: --right now - right now - right now--</p><p> CARLSON: --like \"Really? We're going to do that?\"</p><p> PARKER: --you're - you're focusing on a part that's actually quite not the  whole bill, right? So, the big thing is to review social media--</p><p> CARLSON: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?</p><p> PARKER: --right?</p><p> CARLSON: I mean--</p><p> PARKER: Exactly.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p> PARKER: It's not the--</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> PARKER: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly. But it--</p><p> PARKER: It's not the whole bill--</p><p> CARLSON: --but it is--</p><p> PARKER: --but it's - it's - it's part of it.</p><p> CARLSON: --right. It's part of it. And you don't see that as fascist in  anyway?</p><p> PARKER: And--</p><p> CARLSON: Are there any other decisions that I mean should the State Police  have to sign off on your marriage, do you think, or how many kids you can  have? Would that be - I mean because, obviously, some people shouldn't be  getting married.</p><p> PARKER: Right. But what we'll talk (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Would that be all right?</p><p> PARKER: --what - what we're, again, concerned about is the safety of the  people in the State of New York. And we're concerned that that people are--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. I'm not going to--</p><p> PARKER: --getting - are getting shot down.</p><p> CARLSON: --movie shooting your (ph) point.</p><p> PARKER: It's - it's--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not going to--</p><p> PARKER: --it's too important (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --guess it's that (ph) obviously.</p><p> PARKER: No, well - no, what I - what I'm doing - what I'm doing is - is  talking about the values. And this and I get that some people--</p><p> CARLSON: What you're doing is scaring me. </p><p> PARKER: --believe that having a gun is more important and then protecting  the lives of strangers--</p><p> CARLSON: No. I think being able to say (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --but in my job as a state legislator to (ph) in fact to do--</p><p> CARLSON: --controversial things online (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --both.</p><p> CARLSON: --it - last question.</p><p> PARKER: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things,  maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p> PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p> CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p> PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p> PARKER: --we also have--</p><p> CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p> PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p> CARLSON: It may or may not.</p><p> PARKER: And frankly - and - and frankly--</p><p> CARLSON: I mean they are (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --the Supreme Court has already said that that--</p><p> CARLSON: That if you say something naughty--</p><p> PARKER: --some features (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --then--</p><p> PARKER: --for - for instance - for instance, we - we - we limit, you know,  speech all the time like pornography, particularly, child pornography,  right?</p><p> CARLSON: Well - well child--</p><p> PARKER: We limit - we limit--</p><p> CARLSON: --pornography has not been ruled to be speech.</p><p> PARKER: --but - but among (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: And actually, I'd refer you to--</p><p> PARKER: --actually it is (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --Brandenburg versus Ohio 1967, which is the final word on speech  from the Supreme Court, since you're interested, and it allows all speech  except speech that calls for imminent violence--</p><p> PARKER: Ah, like getting a--</p><p> CARLSON: --all speech. They're not exactly (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --like getting a gun and running into a synagogue. Right, that - I  will--</p><p> CARLSON: Please.</p><p> PARKER: --that imminent violence, right? So--</p><p> CARLSON: That's not speech--</p><p> PARKER: --we effect these (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's violence.</p><p> PARKER: --well, again--</p><p> CARLSON: Please.</p><p> PARKER: --so then we have--</p><p> CARLSON: You know what?</p><p> PARKER: --so we have to (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Now you're really scaring me--</p><p> PARKER: --so we have to limit--</p><p> CARLSON: --whatever of course (ph)--</p><p> PARKER: --so we have to limit violence. And I'm saying you limit violence--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. By limiting the--</p><p> PARKER: --by limiting the kind of--</p><p> CARLSON: --speech.</p><p> PARKER: --limits the violence (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: And eliminating privacy, OK--</p><p> PARKER: No. Come on--</p><p> CARLSON: --all right. Come on, give me your password. All right, I'm going  to send you my text. And you text me your Facebook password. I'm going to  assess--</p><p> PARKER: OK. Good (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --what I think of it and we could talk about it tomorrow.</p><p> PARKER: Great. Let's do that--</p><p> CARLSON: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p> PARKER: --next time.</p><p> CARLSON: I will send it (ph).</p><p> PARKER: Thank you for having me on.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p> Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports lives in a world where you're not allowed  to say what you think. And yet, he says whatever he thinks and thrives. So,  he's just the man to talk to about the battle against free speech that a  lot of us are waging.</p><p> Up next, the press says the Mueller investigation has exposed literally  something called treason by General Mike Flynn. We ask once again, is there  treason? If so, how did he commit it? Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well last night we got some details from Mueller's prosecutors  about General Michael Flynn's cooperation with the investigation. Mueller  recommended no jail time for Flynn. Most of the report is still redacted.</p><p> So, we really don't know what most of this is about. But some people on  television are very confident that Mike Flynn committed treason.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIONS OFFICER:  What the Russians did to us was an intelligence operation. It was an  intelligence attack on the core of our democracy. And that's why - what  Flynn did in supporting a candidate who the Russians were helping through  this operation so egregious.</p><p> RALPH PETERS, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL, AUTHOR: As a  former officer, I'd send him to jail for life. He betrayed his country.</p><p> You wind up being torn about it. You know, on a personal level, his life is  already ruined.</p><p> He may be pardonable. But he's - but it's unforgivable.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: It's almost like the dumber you are, the more time you spend on  television. There's got to be a formula. </p><p> Joe diGenova is not dumb. He's a former U.S. Attorney for the District of  Columbia, and he joins us tonight to assess what's actually happening here.  Is there any evidence in the filing last night that General Flynn committed  treason?</p><p> JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: No.  Actually, those two people you just saw are idiots, and they--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DIGENOVA: --don't know what they're talking about. General Flynn actually  did nothing wrong. The agent said he didn't lie. But Mueller decided he was  going to charge him with lying, anyway.</p><p> Everything that General Flynn did was legal. The - the transition team  communicating with the Russians and other foreign diplomats, perfectly  legal. This was a - this was a designed plot to frame General Flynn so that  they could figure out a way to go after President Trump. </p><p> It's all part of the same theme. This is anybody with a brain can figure  out that Sally Yates had already decided that they were going to frame  General Flynn. And, you know what? They succeeded. They did. They framed  him.</p><p> CARLSON: So, the - the report we got last night from Mueller's team  suggests that Flynn was cooperating in various other ancillary  investigations.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What might those be?</p><p> DIGENOVA: You know, I saw that little - it's a very short pleading. It was  only like--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DIGENOVA: --six or seven pages. And it had a page that was all dark with  all these ominous things, which allegedly went to the content and the  context of the--</p><p> CARLSON: Is there anything else (ph)--</p><p> DIGENOVA: --communications that the--</p><p> CARLSON: there (ph)--</p><p> DIGENOVA: --transition team had. Well, there's no evidence that anything  else that he has cooperated on has anything to do with Russian collusion,  the basic premise for this idiotic investigation that Mueller helped set  up. </p><p> And so, the answer is, I have no idea what he's cooperating on, and it  can't be anything of significance. Otherwise, they would have mentioned it  somewhere in their pleadings.</p><p> CARLSON: So, just to, like take two steps back, I think you know General  Flynn. I know General Flynn.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Yes, I do.</p><p> CARLSON: And here you have a guy who ran a Federal Intelligence Agency, who  was a General in the Armed Services who committed perjury, says Robert  Mueller, and whose life has been completely destroyed. Is that an  overstatement?</p><p> DIGENOVA: It's not an overstatement. And, in fact, that was their goal. </p><p> Their goal was to make it impossible for him not to have his life destroyed  so that it - they could have a skin, so that they could show that somebody  did something wrong, who was communicating with a Russian, even though  those communications with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians and  other foreign officials were perfectly legal. </p><p> Sally Yates made up this Logan Act nonsense, which he was not charged with,  nobody's been charged in a 100 years with violating the Logan Act. Perhaps,  they should look at John Kerry.</p><p> The bottom line is this was a frame-up of General Flynn to get Donald  Trump. And, you know what? It almost worked, except there was no collusion.  Mueller knew it when he was appointed. Rod Rosenstein knew there was  collusion when he appointed him.</p><p> CARLSON: The lesson is never plead, fight.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Always fight.</p><p> CARLSON: Always fight.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Never give in.</p><p> CARLSON: And don't talk voluntarily, my God.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Take the Fifth.</p><p> CARLSON: Take the--</p><p> DIGENOVA: That's why God made it.</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha. Jim - the Jimmy Hoffa rule. And I, by the way, I'm for  that. Joe diGenova, thank you very much.</p><p> DIGENOVA: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Ken Starr was the Independent Counsel, of course, during the  Clinton Administration, and recently wrote the book, Contempt: A Memoir of  the Clinton Investigation. He joins us tonight.</p><p> Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on. So--</p><p> KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --to - to Joe diGenova's point, which I - I think sounds right  that nothing we have seen on earth by the Mueller investigation so far, at  least, pertaining to American citizens, relates to Russian collusion. Does  it bother you that the investigation seems to have gone off on a tangent?</p><p> STARR: I don't think it's a tangent. And I've got a different perspective,  not on the collusion point. I completely agree with Joe. There's nothing  about this that smacks of or even suggests collusion with the Russians. </p><p> But just taking the documents that were filed at face value, and Joe may  call them into question, but just taking them for what they say, they say  that General Flynn lied multiple times to different agencies, different  folks in the Justice Department, including about Turkey, his representation  of Turkey, his representation in terms of why did he write an op-ed piece. </p><p> And you can say, \"Who cares about this?\" Well I will say this, \"Don't lie  to the investigators.\" From what I've seen--</p><p> CARLSON: I agree with that.</p><p> STARR: --from what I've seen, there was no perjury trap. He was able to  tell the truth, but for some reason, about issues that he had every reason  to be involved with the Russian Ambassador, issues with respect to  sanctions, the - going forward, what's the relationship going to be with  Russia. </p><p> This is a completely appropriate contact that he had. And so, why he fell  into this pattern, and it's a pattern, apparently. Just, again, I'm taking  what the document says that Mr. Mueller--</p><p> CARLSON: No. Wait, but may--</p><p> STARR: --filed.</p><p> CARLSON: --I stop you there and ask, my understanding is that the  conversation in question with FBI agents that forms the basis of these  charges was a voluntary one at which he did not have a--</p><p> STARR: Correct.</p><p> CARLSON: --lawyer present. Is that correct (ph)? Took place in the White  House and he didn't - I mean, if he understood it was an interview, he  would have had an attorney, correct? But he didn't. So, what does that--</p><p> STARR: Oh, yes it, yes have (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --tell you?</p><p> STARR: --it - it tells you that for whatever reason, if he made a mistake,  if it's an honest mistake, but that's not what he's pled to.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: He's pled to lying. So, whether it's poor judgment on his part, and  it - and it is. It's an American tragedy. His 33 years of service, five  years combat, Defense Intelligence Agency, so this is someone who's had  this exemplary career. </p><p> And I quite agree this is a hugely tragic. But I don't think it works to  simply say, \"Hey he didn't tell the truth. Who cares?\" And no one said  that. But I think that's the thrust of some of the--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --critique that we are hearing that--</p><p> CARLSON: Well I think the - but the--</p><p> STARR: --it's OK be--</p><p> CARLSON: --the broader question and I think this--</p><p> STARR: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --this arose during the investigation--</p><p> STARR: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: --that you presided over is at what cost to the country. I mean  OK. But I mean--</p><p> STARR: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: --if you, so you empower this guy who basically in real life has  no oversight. Let's not pretend. He doesn't have any oversight. And you  empower him in order to uncover the Russian plot. And then he winds up  threatening people with prison for things that have nothing to do with the  Russian plot, so like how do we benefit from that exactly?</p><p> STARR: And that's a very fair question. The whole Special Counsel  apparatus, the Independent Counsel apparatus, those are fair questions.  Let's talk about those kinds of questions.</p><p> Now, the check that was on me, as Independent Counsel, was, I didn't simply  say, \"Let's go investigate Monica Lewinsky.\" The Attorney General of the  United States made that determination. And I think--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STARR: --that's lost on the American people. And so too here--</p><p> CARLSON: I think that's probably true.</p><p> STARR: --yes. And so too here, there are checks you may say, \"Well how much  of a check has it been?\" But right now, the person who is in charge of this  investigation, not day-to-day, is Matt Whitaker, the acting Attorney  General, under the regulations.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STARR: So, let's see. Let's - let's see what unfolds in the coming days.</p><p> CARLSON: I - I don't think he'll be (ph). Very quickly, Mr. Starr, you knew  President George H.W. Bush for an - an awful long time, 50 years.</p><p> STARR: Oh, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What was your - what was your feeling about the service today?</p><p> STARR: Oh, it was an absolutely gorgeous outpouring. I loved, among other  things, Senator Alan Simpson talking about the road in Washington D.C. of  humility. It's not very crowded. But that's the road that George Herbert  Walker Bush walked on. </p><p> I was overruled by him, by the way, as President of the United States, when  I was serving as Solicitor General. And, you know what? He was very wise  and overruling me. He was right. I wasn't. He was a great man.</p><p> CARLSON: Wow, a footnote to history. Ken Starr, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p> STARR: Hey, thank you, Tucker. My pleasure.</p><p> CARLSON: The State of California was once the richest state. Today, it's  the poorest state, by far. Why is that? There is a reason. And we've got it  for you, after the break.</p><p> Plus, one of the best sights and sounds from today's funeral for the 41st  President of the United States.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JENNA BUSH HAGER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH,  AMERICAN NEWS PERSONALITY, TEACHER, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: A reading from  Revelation--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, for more than a century, California represented everything  that was great about America. In 1849, thousands rode wagons across the  entire continent to participate in the Gold Rush. In the early 1900s, film  directors came by the dozens from the East Coast and made Los Angeles the  center of global film production. </p><p> During the Dust Bowl, thousands of Midwestern farmers found refuge in the  Central Valley. And, of course, for decades, California has been home to  the world's greatest technological innovation. </p><p> It's no accident that California became the country's richest state. It was  a land of limitless opportunity. Even if you never made millions there, you  could live in what was, in effect, a middle-class paradise. </p><p> That's not true anymore. According to the census, almost a fifth of  Californians now live in poverty. That's the highest percentage in the  country. California's middle-class is fleeing to Phoenix and Reno and  Boise. Soon, the state will be comprised almost entirely of rich and poor. </p><p> How did this happen? That question is rarely asked. The answer is pretty  simple. Low-skilled immigration overwhelmed California. More than a quarter  of the state's entire population, as of today, is foreign-born. Again, the  highest rate in the country.</p><p> Some of these immigrants are building successful new companies in Silicon  Valley, good for them. But most of them are not. In fact, the overwhelming  majority of these immigrants are on welfare. </p><p> Fully 72 percent of non-citizen households in the State of California now  receive aid. That compares to just 35 percent of native-born households,  more than double the rate. Now, a 100 years ago, immigrants came to  California for opportunity. And now, they come for the benefits. Who can  blame them? </p><p> Democrats long ago discovered that welfare is a handy vote-buying scheme.  Free stuff equals political power. So, they give more even as native-born  Californians are forced to flee an increasingly unaffordable state.  Democratic lawmakers, even now, are considering a new bill that would give  state-funded health insurance to adult illegal immigrants. </p><p> That means that literally anybody from anywhere on the globe could hop the  border in Tijuana and get healthcare paid for by California taxpayers.  Pretty generous. If only California cared about its own people this much,  it would still be the Golden State.</p><p> Well, President George H.W. Bush was honored today in a state funeral at  the Washington National Cathedral. It was a moving tribute to the country's  41st President. Here's some of the highlights from it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEORGE WALKER BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was born with  just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BUSH: He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and  great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began  to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We  tested his patience. I know I did.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BUSH: But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.</p><p> Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy  answered the phone said he - \"I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said  anything for most of the day.\" I said, \"Dad, I love you, and you've been a  wonderful father.\" And the last words he would ever say on earth were, \"I  love you, too.\"</p><p> We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay  with us forever. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of  knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or  daughter could have.</p><p> And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and  holding Mom's hand again.</p><p> (CROWD APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Wow. </p><p> Tomorrow, a funeral service for President Bush would be held in Houston,  Texas. Bush 41 will then be laid to rest at his Presidential Library on the  campus of the University - Texas A&amp;M University. Stay with Fox News  throughout the day tomorrow for coverage of that.</p><p> So, riots are taking place in Paris and throughout France. They're about  climate change, and they tell you a lot about the attitudes of the people  in charge. We'll investigate that after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, for decades now, elites have told the rest of us that they  are deeply, deeply concerned about climate change, much more concerned than  we are, because they're deeper and more thoughtful and compassionate  people.</p><p> Bernie Sanders, for example, deeply concerned.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BERNARD SANDERS, POLITICIAN, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VERMONT: Donald  Trump spoke last night. But somehow, he forgot to mention the words,  \"Climate Change.\" What an outrage?</p><p> Climate change is causing devastating problems in our country and the  world.</p><p> Climate change is the great global environmental crisis that we face.</p><p> In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. </p><p> Yes, Mr. Trump, climate change is real.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: It's real. And he feels it deeply.</p><p> Over at NBC, by the way, one of their anchors recently wondered if climate  change is so serious that it might render our lives without meaning.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KATHARINE BEAR TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC LIVE ANCHOR, AUTHOR:  Fires, flood, storms, famine, the effects of climate change are all around  us. And according to a new essay penned by Bill McKibben, it is shrink - it  is shrinking our world. Not livably - not literally, excuse me, but  livably.</p><p> I read that New Yorker article today and I thought \"Gosh, how pointless is  my life, and how pointless is the - are the decisions that I'm making on a  day-to-day basis when we are not focused on climate change every day, when  it's not leading every one of our newscasts?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. In other words, if it's not about climate change it doesn't  really matter. So, let's take this seriously just for a second. Why not?  They're always telling us. Let's take what they say at face value.</p><p> They care deeply about climate change. But if they care as deeply as they  say they do, if they believe the destruction of the planet is as imminent  as they say it is, why are they living the way that they do?</p><p> You just saw the tape of Bernie Sanders. He cares a lot. And yet a (ph)  news story came out today that said he spent $300,000 in a single month  flying on a private plane. Huh? </p><p> How could he do that? How could any of them own second homes, if they  really believe climate change is real? How are they using a car service  when they could use mass transit? Why aren't they all vegans? Why aren't  they living what they say they believe? They're not.</p><p> The solutions they suggest, and this is not unrelated, are almost always  going to be paid for by other people. The most regressive kinds of taxes,  energy taxes, imposed on the masses. Well, as the riots in Paris show, the  masses aren't into this. And why would they be?</p><p> Nomiki Konst is a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, and she  joins us tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on. So--</p><p> NOMIKI KONST, CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: Hi, Tucker. How  you're doing?</p><p> CARLSON: I'm great. So, most - but I'm a little bit confused. So, mostly,  debates about climate change or one person saying it's real and the other  one's like--</p><p> KONST: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --ah, we don't really have all the evidence. Granted, I grant  everything you say about climate change. I'm just - just for the sake of  this conversation.</p><p> KONST: Well thank you, that's a start.</p><p> CARLSON: You know, OK--</p><p> KONST: You admit it (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --but if you really believe what you're saying, and if Bernie  Sanders really believes what he's saying, then why is he flying on private  planes? I mean I'm - this is sincere question.</p><p> KONST: So, let's not get distracted from the real issue here, what--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--</p><p> KONST: --the real issue--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not going to - stop, stop, stop. I'm not going to let you  off that easily. </p><p> KONST: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Why is it not a real issue? If climate change, as Katy Tur just  told us, is really the only--</p><p> KONST: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: --issue that matters, then why aren't we living like it's the only  issue that matters?</p><p> KONST: Because it really comes down--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't understand.</p><p> KONST: --to the industry. If the industry wants to make planes that exist  off of renewable energy rather than - than oil and gas, then we will all be  able to live on this planet. It starts at the industry level, not the  consumer. You know, it's not fair--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. So - so the individual--</p><p> KONST: --to put the tax--</p><p> CARLSON: --oh it - it's not--</p><p> KONST: --on the individual.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's not fair--</p><p> KONST: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --for someone who's telling us the planet's being destroyed to  live in a way that suggests that he actually believes the planet's being  destroyed. So, I don't - I don't - I honestly I really don't get it. </p><p> So, if you're Al Gore and you say, \"Nothing is more important than climate  change. I'm a better person than you are because I care more than you. By  the way, I have one of the largest houses in Nashville and I fly private,  and I take a suburban to the private Airport, to the FBO,\" why should I be  OK?</p><p> I mean, I'm - sincerely, why don't--</p><p> KONST: Because that is not going to solve--</p><p> CARLSON: --why is that OK?</p><p> KONST: --individual choices are not going to solve the disaster that we are  facing. We already have a migration issue.</p><p> CARLSON: Why?</p><p> KONST: We already have flooding. We already have hurricanes like--</p><p> CARLSON: Why aren't--</p><p> KONST: --that have hit Puerto Rico, have hit - have hit New Orleans, have  hit Florida, and have displaced--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p> KONST: --so many working people. This is an industry change. We have to cap  emissions globally.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but hold on. But hold on, then why are we--</p><p> KONST: And if we don't cap emissions--</p><p> CARLSON: --then why are--</p><p> KONST: --with big industries and policy--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> KONST: --then those individual choices mean nothing.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well first of all--</p><p> KONST: You have to change the standards.</p><p> CARLSON: --first of all, hold on, first of all, individual choices always  mean something.</p><p> KONST: In a libertarian's-- </p><p> CARLSON: Only it sees (ph)--</p><p> KONST: --fantasy world, sure.</p><p> CARLSON: Not - I'm not - I'm not a libertarian. And I'm not living in a  fantasy world. In real life, individual choices matter or else what's the  point of any of this, OK? So, it does start - well Liberals used to say it  starts with one person. </p><p> I guess they don't anymore because they don't want to be held to their own  standards. But the solutions are always like ordinary working people ought  to pay higher gas taxes--</p><p> KONST: It's not the solution at all.</p><p> CARLSON: --but I get--</p><p> KONST: And, actually, we are against that. Progressives versus the  neoliberals and neocons, progressives understand that this needs to be a  huge policy change. With the place where we are right now, if we increase  the temperature one degree, you and I won't be living in D.C., in New York  anymore. </p><p> CARLSON: OK. But - but hold on - hold on--</p><p> KONST: We will be displaced.</p><p> CARLSON: --but no, no, I want to talk about the--</p><p> KONST: And industries will lose money.</p><p> CARLSON: --public policy. OK--</p><p> KONST: Yes, public policy.</p><p> CARLSON: --I want to talk about the public policy--</p><p> KONST: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --solutions that will flow from the predictions that you're  making. Is there any solution you've ever heard of that doesn't increase  the price of energy?</p><p> KONST: Absolutely (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I've never heard of one.</p><p> KONST: Well, OK. So, if you're going to be focused on the price of energy,  we're not going to have a plan--</p><p> CARLSON: Well because--</p><p> KONST: --in 10 years.</p><p> CARLSON: --well hold on--</p><p> KONST: We have to talk about changing--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait hold on--</p><p> KONST: --but let me finish--</p><p> CARLSON: --I thought you cared--</p><p> KONST: --Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --I thought you cared about working people. And with--</p><p> KONST: We're going down a rabbit hole. I want to talk about the solutions.</p><p> CARLSON: We're not.</p><p> KONST: The solution would be a Green New Deal, moving to 100 percent  renewable energy, forcing the companies that are jacking up the prices on  working people--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> KONST: --to actually reduce their emissions, so that working people aren't  displaced, so working people--</p><p> CARLSON: But can I ask you a question?</p><p> KONST: --don't have to pay the cost of hurricane damage--</p><p> CARLSON: Can I ask you a question?</p><p> KONST: --and have clean water--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p> KONST: --and the water's not being privatized.</p><p> CARLSON: --OK. Volume is not the same as an argument, OK? So, just really  simple question, would your solution--</p><p> PARKER: You don't like opinion of women, do you?</p><p> CARLSON: --I live with four of them.</p><p> KONST: Volume.</p><p> CARLSON: You're not going to go, \"You're a sexist now\"--</p><p> KONST: You're pretty loud. My ear piece is--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK. OK.</p><p> KONST: --blaring right now.</p><p> CARLSON: Let me - let me just ask you a really simple question. Would the  solutions that you're espousing now--</p><p> KONST: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --would they raise the price of gasoline for wage earners, the  ones--</p><p> KONST: Not with the Green New Deal.</p><p> CARLSON: --you claim to care about.</p><p> KONST: I'm actually against--</p><p> CARLSON: It wouldn't. Gas would be the same price.</p><p> KONST: --I am against raising consumer prices. That is a neoliberal design.  I am a Democratic Socialist. I think we should pass policies and actually  make rich people, millionaires and billionaires, and corporations, pay  taxes. That's the problem.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> KONST: No one at the top is paying taxes and the--</p><p> CARLSON: But - but you would allow--</p><p> KONST: --burden is going to the consumer.</p><p> CARLSON: --but you would allow private planes to fly, I guess, right? That  wouldn't--</p><p> KONST: I think private planes have an obligation--</p><p> CARLSON: --be a problem for you at all.</p><p> KONST: --to change their standards. That is what policy is all about. If we  didn't regulate water--</p><p> CARLSON: So we get solar private planes.</p><p> KONST: --solar private plane - I mean I don't know how that would function.  But I think that there are other efficient--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't either.</p><p> KONST: --of energy--</p><p> CARLSON: Name one--</p><p> KONST: --energy use.</p><p> CARLSON: --name - really quick, just for fun, name a renewable energy  source that could power--</p><p> KONST: I mean there's--</p><p> CARLSON: --an airplane.</p><p> KONST: --well there's - there's - I mean we see it with cars. We have--</p><p> CARLSON: Hemp? No, I'm - seriously--</p><p> KONST: --you could charge--</p><p> CARLSON: --is there one?</p><p> KONST: --I mean there are - do you - do you know what a Prius is and a  Tesla is? You could do that--</p><p> CARLSON: I know (ph) they could power an airplane--</p><p> KONST: --at the level of private planes as such (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --an electric airplane, a big electric airplane.</p><p> KONST: Absolutely.</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p> KONST: I mean I am no engineer but I have heard of electric cars--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't think--</p><p> KONST: --and airplanes and other forms of electric solutions.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Cool.</p><p> KONST: I mean there's also solar generated so that the electricity that  you're charging with--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. It's solar plant (ph)--</p><p> KONST: --is solar energy--</p><p> CARLSON: We're back to the solar plant, good I'm--</p><p> KONST: --generated or wind generated.</p><p> CARLSON: --look, I'm - I'd be excited (ph). Text me a picture, if you find  one on the internet. Nomiki, thank you very much.</p><p> KONST: We have to solve this problem.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p> KONST: You can't live in - in another planet.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p> Columbia students can't take a joke, it turns out. They're the most  impressive people our society produces but they have no sense of humor that  has kicked a comedian off their campus for telling a very tepid joke.</p><p> Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy tells real jokes and has lived to tell the  tale. How does he do it? He joins us next with his answer.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well, Nimesh Patel works for Saturday Night Live. He is the, in  case you're keeping track, the first Indian-American cast member on that  show. You'd think that would make him a hero to the pro-diversity crowd.  But instead, Patel is a villain tonight. Why?  Well he recently made the mistake of going to Columbia University, where  all the impressive kids go, and did a comedy set briefly before he was  booted off stage. </p><p> He told a joke that began roughly this way. \"Being gay can't be a choice,\"  he said, because, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, this black thing  is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\" </p><p> Now, is that a funny joke? I don't know. Your call. But it's not really  attacking anybody. It hardly seems vicious. But you can't say that in 2018.  So, the question is, what exactly can you say?</p><p> Well Dave Portnoy seems to say exactly whatever he wants to say all the  time. He's the Founder of Barstool Sports. For some reason, it's working  for him, if nobody else. He joins us tonight to tell us how he does that.</p><p> Dave, thanks a lot for joining us. So, am I missing--</p><p> DAVID PORTNOY, BARSTOOL SPORTS FOUNDER, BLOGGER, PODCAST HOST: Thanks for  having me.</p><p> CARLSON: --something. That - that didn't - I didn't think it was a  particularly hilarious joke or maybe there was more to it. He got yelled  offstage before he could finish. But that didn't seem to me to cross any  kind of obvious line, or am I missing the lines, I guess?</p><p> PORTNOY: No. I thought that was a pretty good joke. The name of the event,  by the way, I think, was cultureSHOCK: Reclaim. I mean if you go into a  comedy club and you have shock in there and that offends you, you probably  shouldn't be in the comedy club. </p><p> Very, very odd set of circumstances, to actually being paid, or whatever,  to go to this event and be offended by any sort of joke. And like you said,  that was - that was a nothing joke. I mean I think it's well-written. But  he had to be the most surprised guy in the room.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean what's amazing to me is--</p><p> PORTNOY: I mean, really, it's like--</p><p> CARLSON: --this is Columbia, like these are supposed to be the smartest,  most sophisticated young people in America, certainly ones with the highest  SAT scores. What does it tell you that they have literally no sense of  humor?</p><p> PORTNOY: Well, I mean that actually doesn't even (ph) surprise me about the  Ivy Leagues. I don't know where you went, Tucker. You seem like you'd be an  Ivy League guy with a bowtie and all that. But it's a--</p><p> CARLSON: No.</p><p> PORTNOY: --but Ivy League guys, I mean the stuff, you know, sense of humor  that's kind of the stereotype. But then you have the other side of it. I  mean they're certainly like the Harvard Lampoon. They're certainly famous  for pushing boundaries and things like that. I don't know what this club  was.</p><p> The - it was Asian Allegiance of something. Again, you can't name the event  cultureSHOCK, and then, when somebody says a pretty vanilla joke in the  schema (ph) jokes, get upset--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> PORTNOY: --very odd, very - he - he just had to be shocked like, \"Whoa,  what did I say?\" He probably didn't even know.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I've asked you this before but I can't get enough of it  because I think it's so interesting. </p><p> You run a site, it's one of the most popular and, I would say, also, one of  the best on the internet, where you seem to say pretty much exactly what  you feel like saying, and all your writers, Francis Ellis, one of my  favorites, on your site have the same attitude, and you continue to do it  without being forced to stop. </p><p> How do you do that? How do you carve out that freedom in a world where  there isn't any freedom?</p><p> PORTNOY: Yes. We built that. Again, we're not a slave to our advertisers.  That's a huge thing. So, we don't get caught in the winds of public opinion  and things like that, and it works for us. </p><p> And to be honest, we've come to now accept in this environment where people  get mad about jokes like that, we're just going to stay true to what we do,  and there is a big market for it. </p><p> And there's always going to be haters. And a lot of times the haters don't  even know what we do. Tucker, I've been called like anti-Semitic, a million  times. I'm Jewish. So, you know, people just don't know what they're--</p><p> CARLSON: What do you--</p><p> PORTNOY: --talking about--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait, hold on, wait, what do you say--</p><p> PORTNOY: --but I get that like once a week--</p><p> CARLSON: --when someone says, \"Dave Portnoy, you anti-Semite,\" what - how  do you respond to that?</p><p> PORTNOY: It depends what type of mood. Sometime, I'll be like, \"Yes, you're  right. You nailed it. I'm like a Nazi or something.\" But it's just - and,  again, I'm playing. And people are so crazy, they even (ph) take that out  of context. </p><p> So, you know, we are a comedy site. We're comfortable in what we do. But if  people don't like something, they feel like they're right. They don't want  to hear the other side of the coin. But they'll go out of their way. </p><p> There were pictures of me, Tucker, on this show, and somebody tried to say  somehow that made me like anti-Semite. And it's like, \"Dude, I'm Jewish, so  what are you talking about?\" </p><p> People just don't really want to look into the context or what's going on.  And we've embraced it. And there is a big market for it. And - and I think  that makes us more popular in this day and age when people are afraid to  say, \"You know, that joke that that guy got booted off stage for, that's  ridiculous.\"</p><p> Steve Carell, The Office, my personal favorite comedy, he was on record, I  think, a couple weeks ago, he says, The Office couldn't exist now. Two  people will get mad.</p><p> CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p> PORTNOY: I mean that's a shame.</p><p> CARLSON: That's true.</p><p> PORTNOY: That's a true shame.</p><p> CARLSON: But you tell the truth and you're winning anyway. That's why  you're an inspiration to the rest of us. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente, great  to see you.</p><p> PORTNOY: Appreciate it.</p><p> CARLSON: One Democratic lawmaker says she has cracked the code that  explains why Democrats aren't winning more seats in the Congress. We'll  tell you what she's discovered, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well Democrats retook the House in November's elections. But they  lost seats in the Senate. And the Blue Wave wasn't quite as big as they  hoped it would be. Why did that happen?</p><p> Well, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii says she knows why.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER: One of the things that we, Democrats, have a really hard time is  connecting to people's hearts instead of here.</p><p> We have a really hard time doing that. And one of the reasons that - that  was told to me at one of our retreats was that we, Democrats, know so much.  That is true. And we have to kind of tell everybody how smart we are.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: We're just too smart. We care too much. We're too erudite. We  believe in science, except biology and ultrasounds. We're just too good.  America doesn't deserve us. </p><p> This is the person who said she knew Kavanaugh was guilty of rape because  he was a man. Just too smart. Amazing! What a world?</p><p> That's the end of our hour. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 P.M., the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. </p><p> Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity, live from New York.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY- HOST: All right. I'm not that smart, just saying.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p> HANNITY: I'm not - I'm not making that claim.</p><p> CARLSON: I'm not that of (ph) that smart either, oh my God.</p><p> HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Mueller investigation appears to be moving in directions that nobody  could have anticipated, none of them obviously connected to Russian  meddling in the past presidential election. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what is the point of all of this? And when and where does it end, if  ever? Ken Starr and Joe diGenova join us in a moment on that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, freedom of speech. Lot of people voted for Donald Trump  in the hope that they would have more of it. But two years in, the opposite  has happened. A ruling class has clamped down, as never before, on personal  expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gone is the free exchange of ideas we were promised. As Americans, it was  supposed to be our birthright, remember? But in its place now, mandatory  soul-deadening conformity, an entire population forced to repeat the same  mindless platitudes, or else.</p><p>An axis of Left-wing corporate power, academia, the media and lawmakers  have all aligned to curb your right to speak freely, which is to say your  right to think for yourself. When they control your words, they control  your mind.</p><p>The Left used to deny that that was their goal. They're not pretending  anymore. They're baring their teeth and snarling. Get in line or we'll hurt  you. </p><p>In a speech on Monday night, CEO Tim Cook pledged that Apple, one of the  biggest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, will do  whatever it takes to silence dissenting opinion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIMOTHY DONALD COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Hate tries to make its  headquarters in the digital world. At Apple, we believe that technology  needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to  get tied up in knots. That's why we only have one message for those who  seek to push hate, division, and violence, you have no place on our  platforms.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Hate, it's a real thing. There's a lot of it out there right now.  But hate is also the word they use for views they don't like or questions  they can't answer. </p><p>Cook's real message is simple. We are holy. You are fallen. Shut up and  obey. CEOs didn't used to talk like this. They were in the business of  selling products, not preaching sermons. </p><p>Then, over time, conventional religion receded from public life, and people  like Tim Cook and his fellow CEOs stepped forward to fill that void. It was  not an upgrade. Apple has a lot more power than the Episcopal Church ever  had, and much less humility, and much less restraint. </p><p>Leaders a 100 years ago could tolerate dissent. They thought God would sort  it out in the end. They didn't have to. Members of our modern ruling class  consider themselves God. They render their own judgment. They view  disagreement as equivalent to apostasy, an attack on the one true faith.</p><p>In New York, to name but one example, among many, a new bill in the state  legislature would ban anyone who says something politicians don't like from  buying a firearm. </p><p>Prospective gun owners will be required to give up their passwords and to  show their social media accounts to regulators who would inspect them for  unapproved thoughts. Sound like something that Chinese military thought up?  Yes, it does.</p><p>But Democrats are not apologizing for it. Listen to one of the sponsors of  the bill explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: If we make this  law and you have to, you know, allow the - you know, the state government  to, in fact, look at your social media posts, you can decide on whether you  want a pistol license or not. You don't have to have a pistol license.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's true. You don't. You don't have to vote either or go to  church of your choice or be tried by a jury of your peers. What other  constitutional rights will soon be contingent on saying the right things? </p><p>To find out, we've invited Kevin Parker on the show tonight. He is the New  York State Senator from Brooklyn, you just saw on that tape. Senator  Parker, welcome. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>PARKER: Thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should just say at the outset what I'm sure of you (ph) as  already know, which is it's already against federal law to sell firearms to  the mentally ill, thank heaven, and I think all of us support that  restriction. So, it's already against the law.</p><p>But what other constitutional rights that we, as Americans, possess should  be contingent on how we behave on social media?</p><p>PARKER: Well, let's be clear. I take an oath that supports the amendments  and - and the whole Constitution, both the U.S. and the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --the state government Constitution. And so, this is really not  about impinging on constitutional rights. This is really about safety. This  is really about how do we, in fact, make the State of New York as safe as  possible.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: Now, we've already been very safe. We're one of the - the top three  safest states in the entire country, particularly when you look at, you  know, - you know, mass shootings, thank God. </p><p>But we can always be safer, and we can always make sure that what happened  in Pittsburgh, what we saw in Parkland, what we saw in Orlando doesn't  happen here.</p><p>And so, this - this law simply says let's look at, you know, what people  are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a -  a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --because what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Well but then - but - but - but hold on, but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: --and, by the way, I agree with your desire to make your state and  - and every state as safe as - as we possibly can. But why restrict it to  gun owners? </p><p>I mean you are an elected official. You are a State Senator. You wield a  lot of power. You control people's lives. Why shouldn't I have the password  to your social media accounts, so we can assess whether you should be  wielding the power that you do?</p><p>PARKER: Well somebody (ph) should put that law and maybe we can - we could  do that. My, first of all, my social--</p><p>CARLSON: Well no, no, no, but no, but it's a--</p><p>PARKER: --my social media--</p><p>CARLSON: --sincere question. Would you send me - would you send me your  password?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker - Tucker, my social media is open right now. You can go on  it and look at it, anybody can look at it. It's public information.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know. Why don't you-- </p><p>PARKER: So, people can look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send but - but hold on--</p><p>PARKER: --at my social media.</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send me your passwords, and I'll find out how open  it really is.</p><p>PARKER: Well, again - again--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you're requiring gun owners to give you their passwords.  Why shouldn't they turn around and ask you for the same? That's--</p><p>PARKER: Well, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --a sincere question.</p><p>PARKER: --look, what we should be talking about is how do we make the State  of New York safe? And I'm simply saying, right now, we're not as safe as we  can be, because people are saying things on social media, and we're not  using that--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --and looking at that as we, in fact, give out a weapon that can  that - that is used to kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I--</p><p>PARKER: Period (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --I - I - I get what you're saying. I guess I'm just wondering why  we're restricting. I mean as long as, and you've said that privacy is not a  concern, and if you have concerns about privacy, you know, don't - don't  carry a gun, don't buy a gun. </p><p>OK. But you're saying that that's the only category to which this applies.  Why don't we apply it to voting?</p><p>PARKER: Again--</p><p>CARLSON: Before you vote and choose who runs the state, who controls your  life, why shouldn't you have your social media checked? I'm not sure--</p><p>PARKER: Because--</p><p>CARLSON: --I understand.</p><p>PARKER: --because voting doesn't necessarily lead to people killing each  other. This is really about access to guns--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, it does.</p><p>PARKER: --no, this is about access to guns. </p><p>CARLSON: Well no--</p><p>PARKER: And we know that there's a direct correlation with the number of  guns that are available in - in - in states, and the - the - the prevalence  of mass shootings. We also know--</p><p>CARLSON: Well we don't - we - we don't know--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that - we know that - we know that in the -  internationally (ph) as well--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just to let you know (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that internationally (ph) as well.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's actually that's - that's not true. I think Wyoming has  the highest per capita gun ownership in the country. I don't think--</p><p>PARKER: Yes. Yes, with the five people--</p><p>CARLSON: --there were any mass shootings--</p><p>PARKER: --with the five people who live in Wyoming--</p><p>CARLSON: --in Wyoming (ph), right, OK--</p><p>PARKER: --and the guns that they have.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It - OK, but let me just (ph) say--</p><p>PARKER: But when you look at - when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --there is not a correlation--</p><p>PARKER: --when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --between those two things just in--</p><p>PARKER: --there's absolute - there's absolutely--</p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact (ph). </p><p>PARKER: --there's--</p><p>CARLSON: No, there's not, actually.</p><p>PARKER: --absolutely - there's - Tucker-- </p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --there absolutely is. And--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean look at social science center (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we look at places like Japan--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever, OK.</p><p>PARKER: --when we look at places like Japan and we look at--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but this is--</p><p>PARKER: --places like Australia, they have much lower gun violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So, but - but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --and - and especially mass shootings--</p><p>CARLSON: --but the question - the - the question here is--</p><p>PARKER: --exactly because they limit the number of--</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides--</p><p>PARKER: --guns that people have.</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides - no, but you're not calling for limiting the number  of guns in this bill. You're calling for people to turn over their social  media passwords, so you can decide whether they've said things that are  naughty. And if they have, they don't get to own a gun. </p><p>And so, my question is what other constitutional rights are dependent on  your approval? Is the right to abortion? Should we before allowing women to  have abortions check their social media accounts? Sincere question. And if  - if not, why not?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, I'm really focusing on the issue of gun violence. There's  too much gun violence in our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're--</p><p>PARKER: --too much gun violence in--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I can't - I--</p><p>PARKER: --in - across the country.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I agree. I'm against gun violence --</p><p>PARKER: And it's really important that we--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK but--</p><p>PARKER: --that we get it down.</p><p>CARLSON: --but - but hold on, who's going to make this? I mean you're  obviously not--</p><p>PARKER: The state - New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: --engaged in--</p><p>PARKER: --The--</p><p>CARLSON: --the New York State Police.</p><p>PARKER: --New York State - the New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but they'll just decide? Typically before we determine  someone is mentally ill, we adjudicate that person mentally ill. That's  the--</p><p>PARKER: This is - this is - this is not about mental illness.</p><p>CARLSON: --term we use.</p><p>PARKER: This is an addition to--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --the other - in addition--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --in addition to the other criteria that the New York State Police  will use and they already use to determine who should be eligible to get a  gun permit, in addition to that, what I'm saying is, we should also have  the State Police review the social media accounts of the people who--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And take the passwords--</p><p>PARKER: --are making the requests.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. And so, on but what - what would cause this? So, the  State Police, independent of a judge, just get to decide whether you can  have a gun or not based on whether or not they like what you've said on  Facebook.</p><p>PARKER: Well the state - the state - the state--</p><p>CARLSON: And they--</p><p>PARKER: --legislature has the ability with - with the signature of the - of  the Governor to, in fact, make law. And so, we make it the law, we then  can, in fact, subscribe--</p><p>CARLSON: So then you turn over to the--</p><p>PARKER: --the power to the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --police--</p><p>PARKER: --to the state police to make a--</p><p>CARLSON: --you know, it's just - it's just--</p><p>PARKER: --determination--</p><p>CARLSON: --interesting, so you--</p><p>PARKER: --which they do all the time--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --by the way.</p><p>CARLSON: --oh, of course, they do like, yes, the police get to unilaterally  decide whether we can exercise our constitutional rights. You're  comfortable giving the--</p><p>PARKER: No, they're not--</p><p>CARLSON: --police that power.</p><p>PARKER: --unilaterally deciding. </p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you would--</p><p>PARKER: The state - the state legislature's-- </p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PARKER: --actually deciding it--</p><p>CARLSON: The state legislature is handing over--</p><p>PARKER: --which the states are allowed (ph) the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --to them the power--</p><p>PARKER: --no, that's - that's, in fact--</p><p>CARLSON: --to their side (ph).</p><p>PARKER: --not done - exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: So, in every - oh? No, it's--</p><p>PARKER: What we - what we do (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --happening (ph), right.</p><p>PARKER: --but they already have that power right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So--</p><p>PARKER: At this very moment, the State Police decide who gets a gun--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Let me just (ph) ask you a human--</p><p>PARKER: --and who doesn't get a gun.</p><p>CARLSON: --question. Do you think it's a little intrusive that the  government would be forcing citizens to turn over their social media  passwords to the police before doing something that Constitution guarantees  them the right to? That doesn't bother you in any way? That doesn't seem a  little bit, say, totalitarian or something--</p><p>PARKER: Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that maybe China would - would do.</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, we make legislation through a process. All the things that  you have objected to, there are lots of people who object to it. There's  conversations that are going on. Maybe all the--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're - you - I'm sorry. I can't--</p><p>PARKER: --but - I got it but may (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --let you third - skirt the third question in a row.</p><p>PARKER: I'm not - I'm not - I'm not skirting it. I'm saying--</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think it's a little bit--</p><p>PARKER: --what I'm saying to you that--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it's a process. I'm--</p><p>PARKER: --there's an (ph) opportunity for-- </p><p>CARLSON: --I'm aware of how (ph) our government works.</p><p>PARKER: --and I - so there's a--</p><p>CARLSON: But I--</p><p>PARKER: --it's opportunity for us to work together to, in fact, look at  this. Maybe the passwords--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you've written--</p><p>PARKER: --won't play in this (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --this bill.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And these are your proposals.</p><p>PARKER: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is essentially (ph) something that you came up with. And  I'm just asking you, as you sat at your laptop and typed out, you will be  required to hand over your passwords to the State Police. And if they don't  like what you say, you don't get to exercise your rights.</p><p>PARKER: Right now--</p><p>CARLSON: So, part of you think, boy, that sounds--</p><p>PARKER: --you know, right (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --really Orwellian to me--</p><p>PARKER: --right now - right now - right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --like \"Really? We're going to do that?\"</p><p>PARKER: --you're - you're focusing on a part that's actually quite not the  whole bill, right? So, the big thing is to review social media--</p><p>CARLSON: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?</p><p>PARKER: --right?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>PARKER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>PARKER: It's not the--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PARKER: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. But it--</p><p>PARKER: It's not the whole bill--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it is--</p><p>PARKER: --but it's - it's - it's part of it.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. It's part of it. And you don't see that as fascist in  anyway?</p><p>PARKER: And--</p><p>CARLSON: Are there any other decisions that I mean should the State Police  have to sign off on your marriage, do you think, or how many kids you can  have? Would that be - I mean because, obviously, some people shouldn't be  getting married.</p><p>PARKER: Right. But what we'll talk (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Would that be all right?</p><p>PARKER: --what - what we're, again, concerned about is the safety of the  people in the State of New York. And we're concerned that that people are--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --getting - are getting shot down.</p><p>CARLSON: --movie shooting your (ph) point.</p><p>PARKER: It's - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --it's too important (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --guess it's that (ph) obviously.</p><p>PARKER: No, well - no, what I - what I'm doing - what I'm doing is - is  talking about the values. And this and I get that some people--</p><p>CARLSON: What you're doing is scaring me. </p><p>PARKER: --believe that having a gun is more important and then protecting  the lives of strangers--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I think being able to say (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --but in my job as a state legislator to (ph) in fact to do--</p><p>CARLSON: --controversial things online (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --both.</p><p>CARLSON: --it - last question.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things,  maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>CARLSON: It may or may not.</p><p>PARKER: And frankly - and - and frankly--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean they are (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --the Supreme Court has already said that that--</p><p>CARLSON: That if you say something naughty--</p><p>PARKER: --some features (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --then--</p><p>PARKER: --for - for instance - for instance, we - we - we limit, you know,  speech all the time like pornography, particularly, child pornography,  right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well - well child--</p><p>PARKER: We limit - we limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --pornography has not been ruled to be speech.</p><p>PARKER: --but - but among (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And actually, I'd refer you to--</p><p>PARKER: --actually it is (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --Brandenburg versus Ohio 1967, which is the final word on speech  from the Supreme Court, since you're interested, and it allows all speech  except speech that calls for imminent violence--</p><p>PARKER: Ah, like getting a--</p><p>CARLSON: --all speech. They're not exactly (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --like getting a gun and running into a synagogue. Right, that - I  will--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --that imminent violence, right? So--</p><p>CARLSON: That's not speech--</p><p>PARKER: --we effect these (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's violence.</p><p>PARKER: --well, again--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --so then we have--</p><p>CARLSON: You know what?</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Now you're really scaring me--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever of course (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit violence. And I'm saying you limit violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. By limiting the--</p><p>PARKER: --by limiting the kind of--</p><p>CARLSON: --speech.</p><p>PARKER: --limits the violence (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And eliminating privacy, OK--</p><p>PARKER: No. Come on--</p><p>CARLSON: --all right. Come on, give me your password. All right, I'm going  to send you my text. And you text me your Facebook password. I'm going to  assess--</p><p>PARKER: OK. Good (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --what I think of it and we could talk about it tomorrow.</p><p>PARKER: Great. Let's do that--</p><p>CARLSON: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>PARKER: --next time.</p><p>CARLSON: I will send it (ph).</p><p>PARKER: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports lives in a world where you're not allowed  to say what you think. And yet, he says whatever he thinks and thrives. So,  he's just the man to talk to about the battle against free speech that a  lot of us are waging.</p><p>Up next, the press says the Mueller investigation has exposed literally  something called treason by General Mike Flynn. We ask once again, is there  treason? If so, how did he commit it? Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night we got some details from Mueller's prosecutors  about General Michael Flynn's cooperation with the investigation. Mueller  recommended no jail time for Flynn. Most of the report is still redacted.</p><p>So, we really don't know what most of this is about. But some people on  television are very confident that Mike Flynn committed treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIONS OFFICER:  What the Russians did to us was an intelligence operation. It was an  intelligence attack on the core of our democracy. And that's why - what  Flynn did in supporting a candidate who the Russians were helping through  this operation so egregious.</p><p>RALPH PETERS, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL, AUTHOR: As a  former officer, I'd send him to jail for life. He betrayed his country.</p><p>You wind up being torn about it. You know, on a personal level, his life is  already ruined.</p><p>He may be pardonable. But he's - but it's unforgivable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like the dumber you are, the more time you spend on  television. There's got to be a formula. </p><p>Joe diGenova is not dumb. He's a former U.S. Attorney for the District of  Columbia, and he joins us tonight to assess what's actually happening here.  Is there any evidence in the filing last night that General Flynn committed  treason?</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: No.  Actually, those two people you just saw are idiots, and they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --don't know what they're talking about. General Flynn actually  did nothing wrong. The agent said he didn't lie. But Mueller decided he was  going to charge him with lying, anyway.</p><p>Everything that General Flynn did was legal. The - the transition team  communicating with the Russians and other foreign diplomats, perfectly  legal. This was a - this was a designed plot to frame General Flynn so that  they could figure out a way to go after President Trump. </p><p>It's all part of the same theme. This is anybody with a brain can figure  out that Sally Yates had already decided that they were going to frame  General Flynn. And, you know what? They succeeded. They did. They framed  him.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the - the report we got last night from Mueller's team  suggests that Flynn was cooperating in various other ancillary  investigations.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What might those be?</p><p>DIGENOVA: You know, I saw that little - it's a very short pleading. It was  only like--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --six or seven pages. And it had a page that was all dark with  all these ominous things, which allegedly went to the content and the  context of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Is there anything else (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --communications that the--</p><p>CARLSON: there (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --transition team had. Well, there's no evidence that anything  else that he has cooperated on has anything to do with Russian collusion,  the basic premise for this idiotic investigation that Mueller helped set  up. </p><p>And so, the answer is, I have no idea what he's cooperating on, and it  can't be anything of significance. Otherwise, they would have mentioned it  somewhere in their pleadings.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to, like take two steps back, I think you know General  Flynn. I know General Flynn.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes, I do.</p><p>CARLSON: And here you have a guy who ran a Federal Intelligence Agency, who  was a General in the Armed Services who committed perjury, says Robert  Mueller, and whose life has been completely destroyed. Is that an  overstatement?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It's not an overstatement. And, in fact, that was their goal. </p><p>Their goal was to make it impossible for him not to have his life destroyed  so that it - they could have a skin, so that they could show that somebody  did something wrong, who was communicating with a Russian, even though  those communications with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians and  other foreign officials were perfectly legal. </p><p>Sally Yates made up this Logan Act nonsense, which he was not charged with,  nobody's been charged in a 100 years with violating the Logan Act. Perhaps,  they should look at John Kerry.</p><p>The bottom line is this was a frame-up of General Flynn to get Donald  Trump. And, you know what? It almost worked, except there was no collusion.  Mueller knew it when he was appointed. Rod Rosenstein knew there was  collusion when he appointed him.</p><p>CARLSON: The lesson is never plead, fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Always fight.</p><p>CARLSON: Always fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Never give in.</p><p>CARLSON: And don't talk voluntarily, my God.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Take the Fifth.</p><p>CARLSON: Take the--</p><p>DIGENOVA: That's why God made it.</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha. Jim - the Jimmy Hoffa rule. And I, by the way, I'm for  that. Joe diGenova, thank you very much.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr was the Independent Counsel, of course, during the  Clinton Administration, and recently wrote the book, Contempt: A Memoir of  the Clinton Investigation. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --to - to Joe diGenova's point, which I - I think sounds right  that nothing we have seen on earth by the Mueller investigation so far, at  least, pertaining to American citizens, relates to Russian collusion. Does  it bother you that the investigation seems to have gone off on a tangent?</p><p>STARR: I don't think it's a tangent. And I've got a different perspective,  not on the collusion point. I completely agree with Joe. There's nothing  about this that smacks of or even suggests collusion with the Russians. </p><p>But just taking the documents that were filed at face value, and Joe may  call them into question, but just taking them for what they say, they say  that General Flynn lied multiple times to different agencies, different  folks in the Justice Department, including about Turkey, his representation  of Turkey, his representation in terms of why did he write an op-ed piece. </p><p>And you can say, \"Who cares about this?\" Well I will say this, \"Don't lie  to the investigators.\" From what I've seen--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with that.</p><p>STARR: --from what I've seen, there was no perjury trap. He was able to  tell the truth, but for some reason, about issues that he had every reason  to be involved with the Russian Ambassador, issues with respect to  sanctions, the - going forward, what's the relationship going to be with  Russia. </p><p>This is a completely appropriate contact that he had. And so, why he fell  into this pattern, and it's a pattern, apparently. Just, again, I'm taking  what the document says that Mr. Mueller--</p><p>CARLSON: No. Wait, but may--</p><p>STARR: --filed.</p><p>CARLSON: --I stop you there and ask, my understanding is that the  conversation in question with FBI agents that forms the basis of these  charges was a voluntary one at which he did not have a--</p><p>STARR: Correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --lawyer present. Is that correct (ph)? Took place in the White  House and he didn't - I mean, if he understood it was an interview, he  would have had an attorney, correct? But he didn't. So, what does that--</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes it, yes have (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell you?</p><p>STARR: --it - it tells you that for whatever reason, if he made a mistake,  if it's an honest mistake, but that's not what he's pled to.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: He's pled to lying. So, whether it's poor judgment on his part, and  it - and it is. It's an American tragedy. His 33 years of service, five  years combat, Defense Intelligence Agency, so this is someone who's had  this exemplary career. </p><p>And I quite agree this is a hugely tragic. But I don't think it works to  simply say, \"Hey he didn't tell the truth. Who cares?\" And no one said  that. But I think that's the thrust of some of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --critique that we are hearing that--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I think the - but the--</p><p>STARR: --it's OK be--</p><p>CARLSON: --the broader question and I think this--</p><p>STARR: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --this arose during the investigation--</p><p>STARR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you presided over is at what cost to the country. I mean  OK. But I mean--</p><p>STARR: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you, so you empower this guy who basically in real life has  no oversight. Let's not pretend. He doesn't have any oversight. And you  empower him in order to uncover the Russian plot. And then he winds up  threatening people with prison for things that have nothing to do with the  Russian plot, so like how do we benefit from that exactly?</p><p>STARR: And that's a very fair question. The whole Special Counsel  apparatus, the Independent Counsel apparatus, those are fair questions.  Let's talk about those kinds of questions.</p><p>Now, the check that was on me, as Independent Counsel, was, I didn't simply  say, \"Let's go investigate Monica Lewinsky.\" The Attorney General of the  United States made that determination. And I think--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --that's lost on the American people. And so too here--</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's probably true.</p><p>STARR: --yes. And so too here, there are checks you may say, \"Well how much  of a check has it been?\" But right now, the person who is in charge of this  investigation, not day-to-day, is Matt Whitaker, the acting Attorney  General, under the regulations.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: So, let's see. Let's - let's see what unfolds in the coming days.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't think he'll be (ph). Very quickly, Mr. Starr, you knew  President George H.W. Bush for an - an awful long time, 50 years.</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What was your - what was your feeling about the service today?</p><p>STARR: Oh, it was an absolutely gorgeous outpouring. I loved, among other  things, Senator Alan Simpson talking about the road in Washington D.C. of  humility. It's not very crowded. But that's the road that George Herbert  Walker Bush walked on. </p><p>I was overruled by him, by the way, as President of the United States, when  I was serving as Solicitor General. And, you know what? He was very wise  and overruling me. He was right. I wasn't. He was a great man.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, a footnote to history. Ken Starr, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STARR: Hey, thank you, Tucker. My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: The State of California was once the richest state. Today, it's  the poorest state, by far. Why is that? There is a reason. And we've got it  for you, after the break.</p><p>Plus, one of the best sights and sounds from today's funeral for the 41st  President of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNA BUSH HAGER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH,  AMERICAN NEWS PERSONALITY, TEACHER, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: A reading from  Revelation--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for more than a century, California represented everything  that was great about America. In 1849, thousands rode wagons across the  entire continent to participate in the Gold Rush. In the early 1900s, film  directors came by the dozens from the East Coast and made Los Angeles the  center of global film production. </p><p>During the Dust Bowl, thousands of Midwestern farmers found refuge in the  Central Valley. And, of course, for decades, California has been home to  the world's greatest technological innovation. </p><p>It's no accident that California became the country's richest state. It was  a land of limitless opportunity. Even if you never made millions there, you  could live in what was, in effect, a middle-class paradise. </p><p>That's not true anymore. According to the census, almost a fifth of  Californians now live in poverty. That's the highest percentage in the  country. California's middle-class is fleeing to Phoenix and Reno and  Boise. Soon, the state will be comprised almost entirely of rich and poor. </p><p>How did this happen? That question is rarely asked. The answer is pretty  simple. Low-skilled immigration overwhelmed California. More than a quarter  of the state's entire population, as of today, is foreign-born. Again, the  highest rate in the country.</p><p>Some of these immigrants are building successful new companies in Silicon  Valley, good for them. But most of them are not. In fact, the overwhelming  majority of these immigrants are on welfare. </p><p>Fully 72 percent of non-citizen households in the State of California now  receive aid. That compares to just 35 percent of native-born households,  more than double the rate. Now, a 100 years ago, immigrants came to  California for opportunity. And now, they come for the benefits. Who can  blame them? </p><p>Democrats long ago discovered that welfare is a handy vote-buying scheme.  Free stuff equals political power. So, they give more even as native-born  Californians are forced to flee an increasingly unaffordable state.  Democratic lawmakers, even now, are considering a new bill that would give  state-funded health insurance to adult illegal immigrants. </p><p>That means that literally anybody from anywhere on the globe could hop the  border in Tijuana and get healthcare paid for by California taxpayers.  Pretty generous. If only California cared about its own people this much,  it would still be the Golden State.</p><p>Well, President George H.W. Bush was honored today in a state funeral at  the Washington National Cathedral. It was a moving tribute to the country's  41st President. Here's some of the highlights from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was born with  just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and  great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began  to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We  tested his patience. I know I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.</p><p>Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy  answered the phone said he - \"I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said  anything for most of the day.\" I said, \"Dad, I love you, and you've been a  wonderful father.\" And the last words he would ever say on earth were, \"I  love you, too.\"</p><p>We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay  with us forever. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of  knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or  daughter could have.</p><p>And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and  holding Mom's hand again.</p><p>(CROWD APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow. </p><p>Tomorrow, a funeral service for President Bush would be held in Houston,  Texas. Bush 41 will then be laid to rest at his Presidential Library on the  campus of the University - Texas A&amp;M University. Stay with Fox News  throughout the day tomorrow for coverage of that.</p><p>So, riots are taking place in Paris and throughout France. They're about  climate change, and they tell you a lot about the attitudes of the people  in charge. We'll investigate that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for decades now, elites have told the rest of us that they  are deeply, deeply concerned about climate change, much more concerned than  we are, because they're deeper and more thoughtful and compassionate  people.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, for example, deeply concerned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNARD SANDERS, POLITICIAN, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VERMONT: Donald  Trump spoke last night. But somehow, he forgot to mention the words,  \"Climate Change.\" What an outrage?</p><p>Climate change is causing devastating problems in our country and the  world.</p><p>Climate change is the great global environmental crisis that we face.</p><p>In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. </p><p>Yes, Mr. Trump, climate change is real.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's real. And he feels it deeply.</p><p>Over at NBC, by the way, one of their anchors recently wondered if climate  change is so serious that it might render our lives without meaning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATHARINE BEAR TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC LIVE ANCHOR, AUTHOR:  Fires, flood, storms, famine, the effects of climate change are all around  us. And according to a new essay penned by Bill McKibben, it is shrink - it  is shrinking our world. Not livably - not literally, excuse me, but  livably.</p><p>I read that New Yorker article today and I thought \"Gosh, how pointless is  my life, and how pointless is the - are the decisions that I'm making on a  day-to-day basis when we are not focused on climate change every day, when  it's not leading every one of our newscasts?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. In other words, if it's not about climate change it doesn't  really matter. So, let's take this seriously just for a second. Why not?  They're always telling us. Let's take what they say at face value.</p><p>They care deeply about climate change. But if they care as deeply as they  say they do, if they believe the destruction of the planet is as imminent  as they say it is, why are they living the way that they do?</p><p>You just saw the tape of Bernie Sanders. He cares a lot. And yet a (ph)  news story came out today that said he spent $300,000 in a single month  flying on a private plane. Huh? </p><p>How could he do that? How could any of them own second homes, if they  really believe climate change is real? How are they using a car service  when they could use mass transit? Why aren't they all vegans? Why aren't  they living what they say they believe? They're not.</p><p>The solutions they suggest, and this is not unrelated, are almost always  going to be paid for by other people. The most regressive kinds of taxes,  energy taxes, imposed on the masses. Well, as the riots in Paris show, the  masses aren't into this. And why would they be?</p><p>Nomiki Konst is a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, and she  joins us tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on. So--</p><p>NOMIKI KONST, CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: Hi, Tucker. How  you're doing?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm great. So, most - but I'm a little bit confused. So, mostly,  debates about climate change or one person saying it's real and the other  one's like--</p><p>KONST: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --ah, we don't really have all the evidence. Granted, I grant  everything you say about climate change. I'm just - just for the sake of  this conversation.</p><p>KONST: Well thank you, that's a start.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, OK--</p><p>KONST: You admit it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --but if you really believe what you're saying, and if Bernie  Sanders really believes what he's saying, then why is he flying on private  planes? I mean I'm - this is sincere question.</p><p>KONST: So, let's not get distracted from the real issue here, what--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>KONST: --the real issue--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not going to - stop, stop, stop. I'm not going to let you  off that easily. </p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is it not a real issue? If climate change, as Katy Tur just  told us, is really the only--</p><p>KONST: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --issue that matters, then why aren't we living like it's the only  issue that matters?</p><p>KONST: Because it really comes down--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't understand.</p><p>KONST: --to the industry. If the industry wants to make planes that exist  off of renewable energy rather than - than oil and gas, then we will all be  able to live on this planet. It starts at the industry level, not the  consumer. You know, it's not fair--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So - so the individual--</p><p>KONST: --to put the tax--</p><p>CARLSON: --oh it - it's not--</p><p>KONST: --on the individual.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not fair--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --for someone who's telling us the planet's being destroyed to  live in a way that suggests that he actually believes the planet's being  destroyed. So, I don't - I don't - I honestly I really don't get it. </p><p>So, if you're Al Gore and you say, \"Nothing is more important than climate  change. I'm a better person than you are because I care more than you. By  the way, I have one of the largest houses in Nashville and I fly private,  and I take a suburban to the private Airport, to the FBO,\" why should I be  OK?</p><p>I mean, I'm - sincerely, why don't--</p><p>KONST: Because that is not going to solve--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that OK?</p><p>KONST: --individual choices are not going to solve the disaster that we are  facing. We already have a migration issue.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>KONST: We already have flooding. We already have hurricanes like--</p><p>CARLSON: Why aren't--</p><p>KONST: --that have hit Puerto Rico, have hit - have hit New Orleans, have  hit Florida, and have displaced--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --so many working people. This is an industry change. We have to cap  emissions globally.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on. But hold on, then why are we--</p><p>KONST: And if we don't cap emissions--</p><p>CARLSON: --then why are--</p><p>KONST: --with big industries and policy--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --then those individual choices mean nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well first of all--</p><p>KONST: You have to change the standards.</p><p>CARLSON: --first of all, hold on, first of all, individual choices always  mean something.</p><p>KONST: In a libertarian's-- </p><p>CARLSON: Only it sees (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --fantasy world, sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Not - I'm not - I'm not a libertarian. And I'm not living in a  fantasy world. In real life, individual choices matter or else what's the  point of any of this, OK? So, it does start - well Liberals used to say it  starts with one person. </p><p>I guess they don't anymore because they don't want to be held to their own  standards. But the solutions are always like ordinary working people ought  to pay higher gas taxes--</p><p>KONST: It's not the solution at all.</p><p>CARLSON: --but I get--</p><p>KONST: And, actually, we are against that. Progressives versus the  neoliberals and neocons, progressives understand that this needs to be a  huge policy change. With the place where we are right now, if we increase  the temperature one degree, you and I won't be living in D.C., in New York  anymore. </p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but hold on - hold on--</p><p>KONST: We will be displaced.</p><p>CARLSON: --but no, no, I want to talk about the--</p><p>KONST: And industries will lose money.</p><p>CARLSON: --public policy. OK--</p><p>KONST: Yes, public policy.</p><p>CARLSON: --I want to talk about the public policy--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --solutions that will flow from the predictions that you're  making. Is there any solution you've ever heard of that doesn't increase  the price of energy?</p><p>KONST: Absolutely (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I've never heard of one.</p><p>KONST: Well, OK. So, if you're going to be focused on the price of energy,  we're not going to have a plan--</p><p>CARLSON: Well because--</p><p>KONST: --in 10 years.</p><p>CARLSON: --well hold on--</p><p>KONST: We have to talk about changing--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait hold on--</p><p>KONST: --but let me finish--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared--</p><p>KONST: --Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared about working people. And with--</p><p>KONST: We're going down a rabbit hole. I want to talk about the solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not.</p><p>KONST: The solution would be a Green New Deal, moving to 100 percent  renewable energy, forcing the companies that are jacking up the prices on  working people--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --to actually reduce their emissions, so that working people aren't  displaced, so working people--</p><p>CARLSON: But can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --don't have to pay the cost of hurricane damage--</p><p>CARLSON: Can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --and have clean water--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --and the water's not being privatized.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Volume is not the same as an argument, OK? So, just really  simple question, would your solution--</p><p>PARKER: You don't like opinion of women, do you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I live with four of them.</p><p>KONST: Volume.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to go, \"You're a sexist now\"--</p><p>KONST: You're pretty loud. My ear piece is--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. OK.</p><p>KONST: --blaring right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just ask you a really simple question. Would the  solutions that you're espousing now--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --would they raise the price of gasoline for wage earners, the  ones--</p><p>KONST: Not with the Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: --you claim to care about.</p><p>KONST: I'm actually against--</p><p>CARLSON: It wouldn't. Gas would be the same price.</p><p>KONST: --I am against raising consumer prices. That is a neoliberal design.  I am a Democratic Socialist. I think we should pass policies and actually  make rich people, millionaires and billionaires, and corporations, pay  taxes. That's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: No one at the top is paying taxes and the--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but you would allow--</p><p>KONST: --burden is going to the consumer.</p><p>CARLSON: --but you would allow private planes to fly, I guess, right? That  wouldn't--</p><p>KONST: I think private planes have an obligation--</p><p>CARLSON: --be a problem for you at all.</p><p>KONST: --to change their standards. That is what policy is all about. If we  didn't regulate water--</p><p>CARLSON: So we get solar private planes.</p><p>KONST: --solar private plane - I mean I don't know how that would function.  But I think that there are other efficient--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't either.</p><p>KONST: --of energy--</p><p>CARLSON: Name one--</p><p>KONST: --energy use.</p><p>CARLSON: --name - really quick, just for fun, name a renewable energy  source that could power--</p><p>KONST: I mean there's--</p><p>CARLSON: --an airplane.</p><p>KONST: --well there's - there's - I mean we see it with cars. We have--</p><p>CARLSON: Hemp? No, I'm - seriously--</p><p>KONST: --you could charge--</p><p>CARLSON: --is there one?</p><p>KONST: --I mean there are - do you - do you know what a Prius is and a  Tesla is? You could do that--</p><p>CARLSON: I know (ph) they could power an airplane--</p><p>KONST: --at the level of private planes as such (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --an electric airplane, a big electric airplane.</p><p>KONST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: I mean I am no engineer but I have heard of electric cars--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think--</p><p>KONST: --and airplanes and other forms of electric solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Cool.</p><p>KONST: I mean there's also solar generated so that the electricity that  you're charging with--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's solar plant (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --is solar energy--</p><p>CARLSON: We're back to the solar plant, good I'm--</p><p>KONST: --generated or wind generated.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I'm - I'd be excited (ph). Text me a picture, if you find  one on the internet. Nomiki, thank you very much.</p><p>KONST: We have to solve this problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>KONST: You can't live in - in another planet.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Columbia students can't take a joke, it turns out. They're the most  impressive people our society produces but they have no sense of humor that  has kicked a comedian off their campus for telling a very tepid joke.</p><p>Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy tells real jokes and has lived to tell the  tale. How does he do it? He joins us next with his answer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Nimesh Patel works for Saturday Night Live. He is the, in  case you're keeping track, the first Indian-American cast member on that  show. You'd think that would make him a hero to the pro-diversity crowd.  But instead, Patel is a villain tonight. Why?  Well he recently made the mistake of going to Columbia University, where  all the impressive kids go, and did a comedy set briefly before he was  booted off stage. </p><p>He told a joke that began roughly this way. \"Being gay can't be a choice,\"  he said, because, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, this black thing  is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\" </p><p>Now, is that a funny joke? I don't know. Your call. But it's not really  attacking anybody. It hardly seems vicious. But you can't say that in 2018.  So, the question is, what exactly can you say?</p><p>Well Dave Portnoy seems to say exactly whatever he wants to say all the  time. He's the Founder of Barstool Sports. For some reason, it's working  for him, if nobody else. He joins us tonight to tell us how he does that.</p><p>Dave, thanks a lot for joining us. So, am I missing--</p><p>DAVID PORTNOY, BARSTOOL SPORTS FOUNDER, BLOGGER, PODCAST HOST: Thanks for  having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --something. That - that didn't - I didn't think it was a  particularly hilarious joke or maybe there was more to it. He got yelled  offstage before he could finish. But that didn't seem to me to cross any  kind of obvious line, or am I missing the lines, I guess?</p><p>PORTNOY: No. I thought that was a pretty good joke. The name of the event,  by the way, I think, was cultureSHOCK: Reclaim. I mean if you go into a  comedy club and you have shock in there and that offends you, you probably  shouldn't be in the comedy club. </p><p>Very, very odd set of circumstances, to actually being paid, or whatever,  to go to this event and be offended by any sort of joke. And like you said,  that was - that was a nothing joke. I mean I think it's well-written. But  he had to be the most surprised guy in the room.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what's amazing to me is--</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean, really, it's like--</p><p>CARLSON: --this is Columbia, like these are supposed to be the smartest,  most sophisticated young people in America, certainly ones with the highest  SAT scores. What does it tell you that they have literally no sense of  humor?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, I mean that actually doesn't even (ph) surprise me about the  Ivy Leagues. I don't know where you went, Tucker. You seem like you'd be an  Ivy League guy with a bowtie and all that. But it's a--</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PORTNOY: --but Ivy League guys, I mean the stuff, you know, sense of humor  that's kind of the stereotype. But then you have the other side of it. I  mean they're certainly like the Harvard Lampoon. They're certainly famous  for pushing boundaries and things like that. I don't know what this club  was.</p><p>The - it was Asian Allegiance of something. Again, you can't name the event  cultureSHOCK, and then, when somebody says a pretty vanilla joke in the  schema (ph) jokes, get upset--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PORTNOY: --very odd, very - he - he just had to be shocked like, \"Whoa,  what did I say?\" He probably didn't even know.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've asked you this before but I can't get enough of it  because I think it's so interesting. </p><p>You run a site, it's one of the most popular and, I would say, also, one of  the best on the internet, where you seem to say pretty much exactly what  you feel like saying, and all your writers, Francis Ellis, one of my  favorites, on your site have the same attitude, and you continue to do it  without being forced to stop. </p><p>How do you do that? How do you carve out that freedom in a world where  there isn't any freedom?</p><p>PORTNOY: Yes. We built that. Again, we're not a slave to our advertisers.  That's a huge thing. So, we don't get caught in the winds of public opinion  and things like that, and it works for us. </p><p>And to be honest, we've come to now accept in this environment where people  get mad about jokes like that, we're just going to stay true to what we do,  and there is a big market for it. </p><p>And there's always going to be haters. And a lot of times the haters don't  even know what we do. Tucker, I've been called like anti-Semitic, a million  times. I'm Jewish. So, you know, people just don't know what they're--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you--</p><p>PORTNOY: --talking about--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, hold on, wait, what do you say--</p><p>PORTNOY: --but I get that like once a week--</p><p>CARLSON: --when someone says, \"Dave Portnoy, you anti-Semite,\" what - how  do you respond to that?</p><p>PORTNOY: It depends what type of mood. Sometime, I'll be like, \"Yes, you're  right. You nailed it. I'm like a Nazi or something.\" But it's just - and,  again, I'm playing. And people are so crazy, they even (ph) take that out  of context. </p><p>So, you know, we are a comedy site. We're comfortable in what we do. But if  people don't like something, they feel like they're right. They don't want  to hear the other side of the coin. But they'll go out of their way. </p><p>There were pictures of me, Tucker, on this show, and somebody tried to say  somehow that made me like anti-Semite. And it's like, \"Dude, I'm Jewish, so  what are you talking about?\" </p><p>People just don't really want to look into the context or what's going on.  And we've embraced it. And there is a big market for it. And - and I think  that makes us more popular in this day and age when people are afraid to  say, \"You know, that joke that that guy got booted off stage for, that's  ridiculous.\"</p><p>Steve Carell, The Office, my personal favorite comedy, he was on record, I  think, a couple weeks ago, he says, The Office couldn't exist now. Two  people will get mad.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean that's a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true.</p><p>PORTNOY: That's a true shame.</p><p>CARLSON: But you tell the truth and you're winning anyway. That's why  you're an inspiration to the rest of us. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente, great  to see you.</p><p>PORTNOY: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: One Democratic lawmaker says she has cracked the code that  explains why Democrats aren't winning more seats in the Congress. We'll  tell you what she's discovered, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well Democrats retook the House in November's elections. But they  lost seats in the Senate. And the Blue Wave wasn't quite as big as they  hoped it would be. Why did that happen?</p><p>Well, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii says she knows why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER: One of the things that we, Democrats, have a really hard time is  connecting to people's hearts instead of here.</p><p>We have a really hard time doing that. And one of the reasons that - that  was told to me at one of our retreats was that we, Democrats, know so much.  That is true. And we have to kind of tell everybody how smart we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We're just too smart. We care too much. We're too erudite. We  believe in science, except biology and ultrasounds. We're just too good.  America doesn't deserve us. </p><p>This is the person who said she knew Kavanaugh was guilty of rape because  he was a man. Just too smart. Amazing! What a world?</p><p>That's the end of our hour. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 P.M., the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. </p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity, live from New York.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: All right. I'm not that smart, just saying.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>HANNITY: I'm not - I'm not making that claim.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not that of (ph) that smart either, oh my God.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Mueller investigation appears to be moving in directions that nobody could have anticipated, none of them obviously connected to Russian meddling in the past presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what is the point of all of this? And when and where does it end, if ever? Ken Starr and Joe diGenova join us in a moment on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, freedom of speech. Lot of people voted for Donald Trump in the hope that they would have more of it. But two years in, the opposite has happened. A ruling class has clamped down, as never before, on personal expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gone is the free exchange of ideas we were promised. As Americans, it was supposed to be our birthright, remember? But in its place now, mandatory soul-deadening conformity, an entire population forced to repeat the same mindless platitudes, or else.</p><p>An axis of Left-wing corporate power, academia, the media and lawmakers have all aligned to curb your right to speak freely, which is to say your right to think for yourself. When they control your words, they control your mind.</p><p>The Left used to deny that that was their goal. They're not pretending anymore. They're baring their teeth and snarling. Get in line or we'll hurt you.</p><p>In a speech on Monday night, CEO Tim Cook pledged that Apple, one of the biggest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, will do whatever it takes to silence dissenting opinion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIMOTHY DONALD COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world. At Apple, we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to get tied up in knots. That's why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division, and violence, you have no place on our platforms.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Hate, it's a real thing. There's a lot of it out there right now. But hate is also the word they use for views they don't like or questions they can't answer.</p><p>Cook's real message is simple. We are holy. You are fallen. Shut up and obey. CEOs didn't used to talk like this. They were in the business of selling products, not preaching sermons.</p><p>Then, over time, conventional religion receded from public life, and people like Tim Cook and his fellow CEOs stepped forward to fill that void. It was not an upgrade. Apple has a lot more power than the Episcopal Church ever had, and much less humility, and much less restraint.</p><p>Leaders a 100 years ago could tolerate dissent. They thought God would sort it out in the end. They didn't have to. Members of our modern ruling class consider themselves God. They render their own judgment. They view disagreement as equivalent to apostasy, an attack on the one true faith.</p><p>In New York, to name but one example, among many, a new bill in the state legislature would ban anyone who says something politicians don't like from buying a firearm.</p><p>Prospective gun owners will be required to give up their passwords and to show their social media accounts to regulators who would inspect them for unapproved thoughts. Sound like something that Chinese military thought up? Yes, it does.</p><p>But Democrats are not apologizing for it. Listen to one of the sponsors of the bill explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: If we make this law and you have to, you know, allow the - you know, the state government to, in fact, look at your social media posts, you can decide on whether you want a pistol license or not. You don't have to have a pistol license.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's true. You don't. You don't have to vote either or go to church of your choice or be tried by a jury of your peers. What other constitutional rights will soon be contingent on saying the right things?</p><p>To find out, we've invited Kevin Parker on the show tonight. He is the New York State Senator from Brooklyn, you just saw on that tape. Senator Parker, welcome. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>PARKER: Thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should just say at the outset what I'm sure of you (ph) as already know, which is it's already against federal law to sell firearms to the mentally ill, thank heaven, and I think all of us support that restriction. So, it's already against the law.</p><p>But what other constitutional rights that we, as Americans, possess should be contingent on how we behave on social media?</p><p>PARKER: Well, let's be clear. I take an oath that supports the amendments and - and the whole Constitution, both the U.S. and the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --the state government Constitution. And so, this is really not about impinging on constitutional rights. This is really about safety. This is really about how do we, in fact, make the State of New York as safe as possible.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: Now, we've already been very safe. We're one of the - the top three safest states in the entire country, particularly when you look at, you know, - you know, mass shootings, thank God.</p><p>But we can always be safer, and we can always make sure that what happened in Pittsburgh, what we saw in Parkland, what we saw in Orlando doesn't happen here.</p><p>And so, this - this law simply says let's look at, you know, what people are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a - a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --because what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Well but then - but - but - but hold on, but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: --and, by the way, I agree with your desire to make your state and - and every state as safe as - as we possibly can. But why restrict it to gun owners?</p><p>I mean you are an elected official. You are a State Senator. You wield a lot of power. You control people's lives. Why shouldn't I have the password to your social media accounts, so we can assess whether you should be wielding the power that you do?</p><p>PARKER: Well somebody (ph) should put that law and maybe we can - we could do that. My, first of all, my social--</p><p>CARLSON: Well no, no, no, but no, but it's a--</p><p>PARKER: --my social media--</p><p>CARLSON: --sincere question. Would you send me - would you send me your password?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker - Tucker, my social media is open right now. You can go on it and look at it, anybody can look at it. It's public information.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know. Why don't you--</p><p>PARKER: So, people can look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send but - but hold on--</p><p>PARKER: --at my social media.</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send me your passwords, and I'll find out how open it really is.</p><p>PARKER: Well, again - again--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you're requiring gun owners to give you their passwords. Why shouldn't they turn around and ask you for the same? That's--</p><p>PARKER: Well, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --a sincere question.</p><p>PARKER: --look, what we should be talking about is how do we make the State of New York safe? And I'm simply saying, right now, we're not as safe as we can be, because people are saying things on social media, and we're not using that--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --and looking at that as we, in fact, give out a weapon that can that - that is used to kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I--</p><p>PARKER: Period (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --I - I - I get what you're saying. I guess I'm just wondering why we're restricting. I mean as long as, and you've said that privacy is not a concern, and if you have concerns about privacy, you know, don't - don't carry a gun, don't buy a gun.</p><p>OK. But you're saying that that's the only category to which this applies. Why don't we apply it to voting?</p><p>PARKER: Again--</p><p>CARLSON: Before you vote and choose who runs the state, who controls your life, why shouldn't you have your social media checked? I'm not sure--</p><p>PARKER: Because--</p><p>CARLSON: --I understand.</p><p>PARKER: --because voting doesn't necessarily lead to people killing each other. This is really about access to guns--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, it does.</p><p>PARKER: --no, this is about access to guns.</p><p>CARLSON: Well no--</p><p>PARKER: And we know that there's a direct correlation with the number of guns that are available in - in - in states, and the - the - the prevalence of mass shootings. We also know--</p><p>CARLSON: Well we don't - we - we don't know--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that - we know that - we know that in the - internationally (ph) as well--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just to let you know (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that internationally (ph) as well.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's actually that's - that's not true. I think Wyoming has the highest per capita gun ownership in the country. I don't think--</p><p>PARKER: Yes. Yes, with the five people--</p><p>CARLSON: --there were any mass shootings--</p><p>PARKER: --with the five people who live in Wyoming--</p><p>CARLSON: --in Wyoming (ph), right, OK--</p><p>PARKER: --and the guns that they have.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It - OK, but let me just (ph) say--</p><p>PARKER: But when you look at - when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --there is not a correlation--</p><p>PARKER: --when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --between those two things just in--</p><p>PARKER: --there's absolute - there's absolutely--</p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact (ph).</p><p>PARKER: --there's--</p><p>CARLSON: No, there's not, actually.</p><p>PARKER: --absolutely - there's - Tucker--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --there absolutely is. And--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean look at social science center (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we look at places like Japan--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever, OK.</p><p>PARKER: --when we look at places like Japan and we look at--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but this is--</p><p>PARKER: --places like Australia, they have much lower gun violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So, but - but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --and - and especially mass shootings--</p><p>CARLSON: --but the question - the - the question here is--</p><p>PARKER: --exactly because they limit the number of--</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides--</p><p>PARKER: --guns that people have.</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides - no, but you're not calling for limiting the number of guns in this bill. You're calling for people to turn over their social media passwords, so you can decide whether they've said things that are naughty. And if they have, they don't get to own a gun.</p><p>And so, my question is what other constitutional rights are dependent on your approval? Is the right to abortion? Should we before allowing women to have abortions check their social media accounts? Sincere question. And if - if not, why not?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, I'm really focusing on the issue of gun violence. There's too much gun violence in our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're--</p><p>PARKER: --too much gun violence in--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I can't - I--</p><p>PARKER: --in - across the country.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I agree. I'm against gun violence --</p><p>PARKER: And it's really important that we--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK but--</p><p>PARKER: --that we get it down.</p><p>CARLSON: --but - but hold on, who's going to make this? I mean you're obviously not--</p><p>PARKER: The state - New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: --engaged in--</p><p>PARKER: --The--</p><p>CARLSON: --the New York State Police.</p><p>PARKER: --New York State - the New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but they'll just decide? Typically before we determine someone is mentally ill, we adjudicate that person mentally ill. That's the--</p><p>PARKER: This is - this is - this is not about mental illness.</p><p>CARLSON: --term we use.</p><p>PARKER: This is an addition to--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --the other - in addition--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --in addition to the other criteria that the New York State Police will use and they already use to determine who should be eligible to get a gun permit, in addition to that, what I'm saying is, we should also have the State Police review the social media accounts of the people who--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And take the passwords--</p><p>PARKER: --are making the requests.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. And so, on but what - what would cause this? So, the State Police, independent of a judge, just get to decide whether you can have a gun or not based on whether or not they like what you've said on Facebook.</p><p>PARKER: Well the state - the state - the state--</p><p>CARLSON: And they--</p><p>PARKER: --legislature has the ability with - with the signature of the - of the Governor to, in fact, make law. And so, we make it the law, we then can, in fact, subscribe--</p><p>CARLSON: So then you turn over to the--</p><p>PARKER: --the power to the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --police--</p><p>PARKER: --to the state police to make a--</p><p>CARLSON: --you know, it's just - it's just--</p><p>PARKER: --determination--</p><p>CARLSON: --interesting, so you--</p><p>PARKER: --which they do all the time--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --by the way.</p><p>CARLSON: --oh, of course, they do like, yes, the police get to unilaterally decide whether we can exercise our constitutional rights. You're comfortable giving the--</p><p>PARKER: No, they're not--</p><p>CARLSON: --police that power.</p><p>PARKER: --unilaterally deciding.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you would--</p><p>PARKER: The state - the state legislature's--</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PARKER: --actually deciding it--</p><p>CARLSON: The state legislature is handing over--</p><p>PARKER: --which the states are allowed (ph) the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --to them the power--</p><p>PARKER: --no, that's - that's, in fact--</p><p>CARLSON: --to their side (ph).</p><p>PARKER: --not done - exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: So, in every - oh? No, it's--</p><p>PARKER: What we - what we do (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --happening (ph), right.</p><p>PARKER: --but they already have that power right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So--</p><p>PARKER: At this very moment, the State Police decide who gets a gun--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Let me just (ph) ask you a human--</p><p>PARKER: --and who doesn't get a gun.</p><p>CARLSON: --question. Do you think it's a little intrusive that the government would be forcing citizens to turn over their social media passwords to the police before doing something that Constitution guarantees them the right to? That doesn't bother you in any way? That doesn't seem a little bit, say, totalitarian or something--</p><p>PARKER: Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that maybe China would - would do.</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, we make legislation through a process. All the things that you have objected to, there are lots of people who object to it. There's conversations that are going on. Maybe all the--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're - you - I'm sorry. I can't--</p><p>PARKER: --but - I got it but may (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --let you third - skirt the third question in a row.</p><p>PARKER: I'm not - I'm not - I'm not skirting it. I'm saying--</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think it's a little bit--</p><p>PARKER: --what I'm saying to you that--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it's a process. I'm--</p><p>PARKER: --there's an (ph) opportunity for--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm aware of how (ph) our government works.</p><p>PARKER: --and I - so there's a--</p><p>CARLSON: But I--</p><p>PARKER: --it's opportunity for us to work together to, in fact, look at this. Maybe the passwords--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you've written--</p><p>PARKER: --won't play in this (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --this bill.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And these are your proposals.</p><p>PARKER: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is essentially (ph) something that you came up with. And I'm just asking you, as you sat at your laptop and typed out, you will be required to hand over your passwords to the State Police. And if they don't like what you say, you don't get to exercise your rights.</p><p>PARKER: Right now--</p><p>CARLSON: So, part of you think, boy, that sounds--</p><p>PARKER: --you know, right (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --really Orwellian to me--</p><p>PARKER: --right now - right now - right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --like \"Really? We're going to do that?\"</p><p>PARKER: --you're - you're focusing on a part that's actually quite not the whole bill, right? So, the big thing is to review social media--</p><p>CARLSON: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?</p><p>PARKER: --right?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>PARKER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>PARKER: It's not the--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PARKER: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. But it--</p><p>PARKER: It's not the whole bill--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it is--</p><p>PARKER: --but it's - it's - it's part of it.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. It's part of it. And you don't see that as fascist in anyway?</p><p>PARKER: And--</p><p>CARLSON: Are there any other decisions that I mean should the State Police have to sign off on your marriage, do you think, or how many kids you can have? Would that be - I mean because, obviously, some people shouldn't be getting married.</p><p>PARKER: Right. But what we'll talk (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Would that be all right?</p><p>PARKER: --what - what we're, again, concerned about is the safety of the people in the State of New York. And we're concerned that that people are--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --getting - are getting shot down.</p><p>CARLSON: --movie shooting your (ph) point.</p><p>PARKER: It's - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --it's too important (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --guess it's that (ph) obviously.</p><p>PARKER: No, well - no, what I - what I'm doing - what I'm doing is - is talking about the values. And this and I get that some people--</p><p>CARLSON: What you're doing is scaring me.</p><p>PARKER: --believe that having a gun is more important and then protecting the lives of strangers--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I think being able to say (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --but in my job as a state legislator to (ph) in fact to do--</p><p>CARLSON: --controversial things online (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --both.</p><p>CARLSON: --it - last question.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things, maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact, we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering the people of the State of New York.</p><p>CARLSON: It may or may not.</p><p>PARKER: And frankly - and - and frankly--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean they are (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --the Supreme Court has already said that that--</p><p>CARLSON: That if you say something naughty--</p><p>PARKER: --some features (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --then--</p><p>PARKER: --for - for instance - for instance, we - we - we limit, you know, speech all the time like pornography, particularly, child pornography, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well - well child--</p><p>PARKER: We limit - we limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --pornography has not been ruled to be speech.</p><p>PARKER: --but - but among (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And actually, I'd refer you to--</p><p>PARKER: --actually it is (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --Brandenburg versus Ohio 1967, which is the final word on speech from the Supreme Court, since you're interested, and it allows all speech except speech that calls for imminent violence--</p><p>PARKER: Ah, like getting a--</p><p>CARLSON: --all speech. They're not exactly (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --like getting a gun and running into a synagogue. Right, that - I will--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --that imminent violence, right? So--</p><p>CARLSON: That's not speech--</p><p>PARKER: --we effect these (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's violence.</p><p>PARKER: --well, again--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --so then we have--</p><p>CARLSON: You know what?</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Now you're really scaring me--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever of course (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit violence. And I'm saying you limit violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. By limiting the--</p><p>PARKER: --by limiting the kind of--</p><p>CARLSON: --speech.</p><p>PARKER: --limits the violence (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And eliminating privacy, OK--</p><p>PARKER: No. Come on--</p><p>CARLSON: --all right. Come on, give me your password. All right, I'm going to send you my text. And you text me your Facebook password. I'm going to assess--</p><p>PARKER: OK. Good (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --what I think of it and we could talk about it tomorrow.</p><p>PARKER: Great. Let's do that--</p><p>CARLSON: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>PARKER: --next time.</p><p>CARLSON: I will send it (ph).</p><p>PARKER: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports lives in a world where you're not allowed to say what you think. And yet, he says whatever he thinks and thrives. So, he's just the man to talk to about the battle against free speech that a lot of us are waging.</p><p>Up next, the press says the Mueller investigation has exposed literally something called treason by General Mike Flynn. We ask once again, is there treason? If so, how did he commit it? Details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night we got some details from Mueller's prosecutors about General Michael Flynn's cooperation with the investigation. Mueller recommended no jail time for Flynn. Most of the report is still redacted.</p><p>So, we really don't know what most of this is about. But some people on television are very confident that Mike Flynn committed treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIONS OFFICER: What the Russians did to us was an intelligence operation. It was an intelligence attack on the core of our democracy. And that's why - what Flynn did in supporting a candidate who the Russians were helping through this operation so egregious.</p><p>RALPH PETERS, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL, AUTHOR: As a former officer, I'd send him to jail for life. He betrayed his country.</p><p>You wind up being torn about it. You know, on a personal level, his life is already ruined.</p><p>He may be pardonable. But he's - but it's unforgivable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like the dumber you are, the more time you spend on television. There's got to be a formula.</p><p>Joe diGenova is not dumb. He's a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, and he joins us tonight to assess what's actually happening here. Is there any evidence in the filing last night that General Flynn committed treason?</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: No. Actually, those two people you just saw are idiots, and they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --don't know what they're talking about. General Flynn actually did nothing wrong. The agent said he didn't lie. But Mueller decided he was going to charge him with lying, anyway.</p><p>Everything that General Flynn did was legal. The - the transition team communicating with the Russians and other foreign diplomats, perfectly legal. This was a - this was a designed plot to frame General Flynn so that they could figure out a way to go after President Trump.</p><p>It's all part of the same theme. This is anybody with a brain can figure out that Sally Yates had already decided that they were going to frame General Flynn. And, you know what? They succeeded. They did. They framed him.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the - the report we got last night from Mueller's team suggests that Flynn was cooperating in various other ancillary investigations.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What might those be?</p><p>DIGENOVA: You know, I saw that little - it's a very short pleading. It was only like--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --six or seven pages. And it had a page that was all dark with all these ominous things, which allegedly went to the content and the context of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Is there anything else (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --communications that the--</p><p>CARLSON: there (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --transition team had. Well, there's no evidence that anything else that he has cooperated on has anything to do with Russian collusion, the basic premise for this idiotic investigation that Mueller helped set up.</p><p>And so, the answer is, I have no idea what he's cooperating on, and it can't be anything of significance. Otherwise, they would have mentioned it somewhere in their pleadings.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to, like take two steps back, I think you know General Flynn. I know General Flynn.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes, I do.</p><p>CARLSON: And here you have a guy who ran a Federal Intelligence Agency, who was a General in the Armed Services who committed perjury, says Robert Mueller, and whose life has been completely destroyed. Is that an overstatement?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It's not an overstatement. And, in fact, that was their goal.</p><p>Their goal was to make it impossible for him not to have his life destroyed so that it - they could have a skin, so that they could show that somebody did something wrong, who was communicating with a Russian, even though those communications with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians and other foreign officials were perfectly legal.</p><p>Sally Yates made up this Logan Act nonsense, which he was not charged with, nobody's been charged in a 100 years with violating the Logan Act. Perhaps, they should look at John Kerry.</p><p>The bottom line is this was a frame-up of General Flynn to get Donald Trump. And, you know what? It almost worked, except there was no collusion. Mueller knew it when he was appointed. Rod Rosenstein knew there was collusion when he appointed him.</p><p>CARLSON: The lesson is never plead, fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Always fight.</p><p>CARLSON: Always fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Never give in.</p><p>CARLSON: And don't talk voluntarily, my God.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Take the Fifth.</p><p>CARLSON: Take the--</p><p>DIGENOVA: That's why God made it.</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha. Jim - the Jimmy Hoffa rule. And I, by the way, I'm for that. Joe diGenova, thank you very much.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr was the Independent Counsel, of course, during the Clinton Administration, and recently wrote the book, Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --to - to Joe diGenova's point, which I - I think sounds right that nothing we have seen on earth by the Mueller investigation so far, at least, pertaining to American citizens, relates to Russian collusion. Does it bother you that the investigation seems to have gone off on a tangent?</p><p>STARR: I don't think it's a tangent. And I've got a different perspective, not on the collusion point. I completely agree with Joe. There's nothing about this that smacks of or even suggests collusion with the Russians.</p><p>But just taking the documents that were filed at face value, and Joe may call them into question, but just taking them for what they say, they say that General Flynn lied multiple times to different agencies, different folks in the Justice Department, including about Turkey, his representation of Turkey, his representation in terms of why did he write an op-ed piece.</p><p>And you can say, \"Who cares about this?\" Well I will say this, \"Don't lie to the investigators.\" From what I've seen--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with that.</p><p>STARR: --from what I've seen, there was no perjury trap. He was able to tell the truth, but for some reason, about issues that he had every reason to be involved with the Russian Ambassador, issues with respect to sanctions, the - going forward, what's the relationship going to be with Russia.</p><p>This is a completely appropriate contact that he had. And so, why he fell into this pattern, and it's a pattern, apparently. Just, again, I'm taking what the document says that Mr. Mueller--</p><p>CARLSON: No. Wait, but may--</p><p>STARR: --filed.</p><p>CARLSON: --I stop you there and ask, my understanding is that the conversation in question with FBI agents that forms the basis of these charges was a voluntary one at which he did not have a--</p><p>STARR: Correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --lawyer present. Is that correct (ph)? Took place in the White House and he didn't - I mean, if he understood it was an interview, he would have had an attorney, correct? But he didn't. So, what does that--</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes it, yes have (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell you?</p><p>STARR: --it - it tells you that for whatever reason, if he made a mistake, if it's an honest mistake, but that's not what he's pled to.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: He's pled to lying. So, whether it's poor judgment on his part, and it - and it is. It's an American tragedy. His 33 years of service, five years combat, Defense Intelligence Agency, so this is someone who's had this exemplary career.</p><p>And I quite agree this is a hugely tragic. But I don't think it works to simply say, \"Hey he didn't tell the truth. Who cares?\" And no one said that. But I think that's the thrust of some of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --critique that we are hearing that--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I think the - but the--</p><p>STARR: --it's OK be--</p><p>CARLSON: --the broader question and I think this--</p><p>STARR: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --this arose during the investigation--</p><p>STARR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you presided over is at what cost to the country. I mean OK. But I mean--</p><p>STARR: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you, so you empower this guy who basically in real life has no oversight. Let's not pretend. He doesn't have any oversight. And you empower him in order to uncover the Russian plot. And then he winds up threatening people with prison for things that have nothing to do with the Russian plot, so like how do we benefit from that exactly?</p><p>STARR: And that's a very fair question. The whole Special Counsel apparatus, the Independent Counsel apparatus, those are fair questions. Let's talk about those kinds of questions.</p><p>Now, the check that was on me, as Independent Counsel, was, I didn't simply say, \"Let's go investigate Monica Lewinsky.\" The Attorney General of the United States made that determination. And I think--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --that's lost on the American people. And so too here--</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's probably true.</p><p>STARR: --yes. And so too here, there are checks you may say, \"Well how much of a check has it been?\" But right now, the person who is in charge of this investigation, not day-to-day, is Matt Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, under the regulations.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: So, let's see. Let's - let's see what unfolds in the coming days.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't think he'll be (ph). Very quickly, Mr. Starr, you knew President George H.W. Bush for an - an awful long time, 50 years.</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What was your - what was your feeling about the service today?</p><p>STARR: Oh, it was an absolutely gorgeous outpouring. I loved, among other things, Senator Alan Simpson talking about the road in Washington D.C. of humility. It's not very crowded. But that's the road that George Herbert Walker Bush walked on.</p><p>I was overruled by him, by the way, as President of the United States, when I was serving as Solicitor General. And, you know what? He was very wise and overruling me. He was right. I wasn't. He was a great man.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, a footnote to history. Ken Starr, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>STARR: Hey, thank you, Tucker. My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: The State of California was once the richest state. Today, it's the poorest state, by far. Why is that? There is a reason. And we've got it for you, after the break.</p><p>Plus, one of the best sights and sounds from today's funeral for the 41st President of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNA BUSH HAGER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH, AMERICAN NEWS PERSONALITY, TEACHER, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: A reading from Revelation--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for more than a century, California represented everything that was great about America. In 1849, thousands rode wagons across the entire continent to participate in the Gold Rush. In the early 1900s, film directors came by the dozens from the East Coast and made Los Angeles the center of global film production.</p><p>During the Dust Bowl, thousands of Midwestern farmers found refuge in the Central Valley. And, of course, for decades, California has been home to the world's greatest technological innovation.</p><p>It's no accident that California became the country's richest state. It was a land of limitless opportunity. Even if you never made millions there, you could live in what was, in effect, a middle-class paradise.</p><p>That's not true anymore. According to the census, almost a fifth of Californians now live in poverty. That's the highest percentage in the country. California's middle-class is fleeing to Phoenix and Reno and Boise. Soon, the state will be comprised almost entirely of rich and poor.</p><p>How did this happen? That question is rarely asked. The answer is pretty simple. Low-skilled immigration overwhelmed California. More than a quarter of the state's entire population, as of today, is foreign-born. Again, the highest rate in the country.</p><p>Some of these immigrants are building successful new companies in Silicon Valley, good for them. But most of them are not. In fact, the overwhelming majority of these immigrants are on welfare.</p><p>Fully 72 percent of non-citizen households in the State of California now receive aid. That compares to just 35 percent of native-born households, more than double the rate. Now, a 100 years ago, immigrants came to California for opportunity. And now, they come for the benefits. Who can blame them?</p><p>Democrats long ago discovered that welfare is a handy vote-buying scheme. Free stuff equals political power. So, they give more even as native-born Californians are forced to flee an increasingly unaffordable state. Democratic lawmakers, even now, are considering a new bill that would give state-funded health insurance to adult illegal immigrants.</p><p>That means that literally anybody from anywhere on the globe could hop the border in Tijuana and get healthcare paid for by California taxpayers. Pretty generous. If only California cared about its own people this much, it would still be the Golden State.</p><p>Well, President George H.W. Bush was honored today in a state funeral at the Washington National Cathedral. It was a moving tribute to the country's 41st President. Here's some of the highlights from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was born with just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We tested his patience. I know I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.</p><p>Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy answered the phone said he - \"I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said anything for most of the day.\" I said, \"Dad, I love you, and you've been a wonderful father.\" And the last words he would ever say on earth were, \"I love you, too.\"</p><p>We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay with us forever. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have.</p><p>And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding Mom's hand again.</p><p>(CROWD APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>Tomorrow, a funeral service for President Bush would be held in Houston, Texas. Bush 41 will then be laid to rest at his Presidential Library on the campus of the University - Texas A&amp;M University. Stay with Fox News throughout the day tomorrow for coverage of that.</p><p>So, riots are taking place in Paris and throughout France. They're about climate change, and they tell you a lot about the attitudes of the people in charge. We'll investigate that after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for decades now, elites have told the rest of us that they are deeply, deeply concerned about climate change, much more concerned than we are, because they're deeper and more thoughtful and compassionate people.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, for example, deeply concerned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNARD SANDERS, POLITICIAN, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VERMONT: Donald Trump spoke last night. But somehow, he forgot to mention the words, \"Climate Change.\" What an outrage?</p><p>Climate change is causing devastating problems in our country and the world.</p><p>Climate change is the great global environmental crisis that we face.</p><p>In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.</p><p>Yes, Mr. Trump, climate change is real.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's real. And he feels it deeply.</p><p>Over at NBC, by the way, one of their anchors recently wondered if climate change is so serious that it might render our lives without meaning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATHARINE BEAR TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC LIVE ANCHOR, AUTHOR: Fires, flood, storms, famine, the effects of climate change are all around us. And according to a new essay penned by Bill McKibben, it is shrink - it is shrinking our world. Not livably - not literally, excuse me, but livably.</p><p>I read that New Yorker article today and I thought \"Gosh, how pointless is my life, and how pointless is the - are the decisions that I'm making on a day-to-day basis when we are not focused on climate change every day, when it's not leading every one of our newscasts?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. In other words, if it's not about climate change it doesn't really matter. So, let's take this seriously just for a second. Why not? They're always telling us. Let's take what they say at face value.</p><p>They care deeply about climate change. But if they care as deeply as they say they do, if they believe the destruction of the planet is as imminent as they say it is, why are they living the way that they do?</p><p>You just saw the tape of Bernie Sanders. He cares a lot. And yet a (ph) news story came out today that said he spent $300,000 in a single month flying on a private plane. Huh?</p><p>How could he do that? How could any of them own second homes, if they really believe climate change is real? How are they using a car service when they could use mass transit? Why aren't they all vegans? Why aren't they living what they say they believe? They're not.</p><p>The solutions they suggest, and this is not unrelated, are almost always going to be paid for by other people. The most regressive kinds of taxes, energy taxes, imposed on the masses. Well, as the riots in Paris show, the masses aren't into this. And why would they be?</p><p>Nomiki Konst is a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, and she joins us tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on. So--</p><p>NOMIKI KONST, CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: Hi, Tucker. How you're doing?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm great. So, most - but I'm a little bit confused. So, mostly, debates about climate change or one person saying it's real and the other one's like--</p><p>KONST: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --ah, we don't really have all the evidence. Granted, I grant everything you say about climate change. I'm just - just for the sake of this conversation.</p><p>KONST: Well thank you, that's a start.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, OK--</p><p>KONST: You admit it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --but if you really believe what you're saying, and if Bernie Sanders really believes what he's saying, then why is he flying on private planes? I mean I'm - this is sincere question.</p><p>KONST: So, let's not get distracted from the real issue here, what--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>KONST: --the real issue--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not going to - stop, stop, stop. I'm not going to let you off that easily.</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is it not a real issue? If climate change, as Katy Tur just told us, is really the only--</p><p>KONST: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --issue that matters, then why aren't we living like it's the only issue that matters?</p><p>KONST: Because it really comes down--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't understand.</p><p>KONST: --to the industry. If the industry wants to make planes that exist off of renewable energy rather than - than oil and gas, then we will all be able to live on this planet. It starts at the industry level, not the consumer. You know, it's not fair--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So - so the individual--</p><p>KONST: --to put the tax--</p><p>CARLSON: --oh it - it's not--</p><p>KONST: --on the individual.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not fair--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --for someone who's telling us the planet's being destroyed to live in a way that suggests that he actually believes the planet's being destroyed. So, I don't - I don't - I honestly I really don't get it.</p><p>So, if you're Al Gore and you say, \"Nothing is more important than climate change. I'm a better person than you are because I care more than you. By the way, I have one of the largest houses in Nashville and I fly private, and I take a suburban to the private Airport, to the FBO,\" why should I be OK?</p><p>I mean, I'm - sincerely, why don't--</p><p>KONST: Because that is not going to solve--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that OK?</p><p>KONST: --individual choices are not going to solve the disaster that we are facing. We already have a migration issue.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>KONST: We already have flooding. We already have hurricanes like--</p><p>CARLSON: Why aren't--</p><p>KONST: --that have hit Puerto Rico, have hit - have hit New Orleans, have hit Florida, and have displaced--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --so many working people. This is an industry change. We have to cap emissions globally.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on. But hold on, then why are we--</p><p>KONST: And if we don't cap emissions--</p><p>CARLSON: --then why are--</p><p>KONST: --with big industries and policy--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --then those individual choices mean nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well first of all--</p><p>KONST: You have to change the standards.</p><p>CARLSON: --first of all, hold on, first of all, individual choices always mean something.</p><p>KONST: In a libertarian's--</p><p>CARLSON: Only it sees (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --fantasy world, sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Not - I'm not - I'm not a libertarian. And I'm not living in a fantasy world. In real life, individual choices matter or else what's the point of any of this, OK? So, it does start - well Liberals used to say it starts with one person.</p><p>I guess they don't anymore because they don't want to be held to their own standards. But the solutions are always like ordinary working people ought to pay higher gas taxes--</p><p>KONST: It's not the solution at all.</p><p>CARLSON: --but I get--</p><p>KONST: And, actually, we are against that. Progressives versus the neoliberals and neocons, progressives understand that this needs to be a huge policy change. With the place where we are right now, if we increase the temperature one degree, you and I won't be living in D.C., in New York anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but hold on - hold on--</p><p>KONST: We will be displaced.</p><p>CARLSON: --but no, no, I want to talk about the--</p><p>KONST: And industries will lose money.</p><p>CARLSON: --public policy. OK--</p><p>KONST: Yes, public policy.</p><p>CARLSON: --I want to talk about the public policy--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --solutions that will flow from the predictions that you're making. Is there any solution you've ever heard of that doesn't increase the price of energy?</p><p>KONST: Absolutely (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I've never heard of one.</p><p>KONST: Well, OK. So, if you're going to be focused on the price of energy, we're not going to have a plan--</p><p>CARLSON: Well because--</p><p>KONST: --in 10 years.</p><p>CARLSON: --well hold on--</p><p>KONST: We have to talk about changing--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait hold on--</p><p>KONST: --but let me finish--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared--</p><p>KONST: --Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared about working people. And with--</p><p>KONST: We're going down a rabbit hole. I want to talk about the solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not.</p><p>KONST: The solution would be a Green New Deal, moving to 100 percent renewable energy, forcing the companies that are jacking up the prices on working people--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --to actually reduce their emissions, so that working people aren't displaced, so working people--</p><p>CARLSON: But can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --don't have to pay the cost of hurricane damage--</p><p>CARLSON: Can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --and have clean water--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --and the water's not being privatized.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Volume is not the same as an argument, OK? So, just really simple question, would your solution--</p><p>PARKER: You don't like opinion of women, do you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I live with four of them.</p><p>KONST: Volume.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to go, \"You're a sexist now\"--</p><p>KONST: You're pretty loud. My ear piece is--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. OK.</p><p>KONST: --blaring right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just ask you a really simple question. Would the solutions that you're espousing now--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --would they raise the price of gasoline for wage earners, the ones--</p><p>KONST: Not with the Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: --you claim to care about.</p><p>KONST: I'm actually against--</p><p>CARLSON: It wouldn't. Gas would be the same price.</p><p>KONST: --I am against raising consumer prices. That is a neoliberal design. I am a Democratic Socialist. I think we should pass policies and actually make rich people, millionaires and billionaires, and corporations, pay taxes. That's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: No one at the top is paying taxes and the--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but you would allow--</p><p>KONST: --burden is going to the consumer.</p><p>CARLSON: --but you would allow private planes to fly, I guess, right? That wouldn't--</p><p>KONST: I think private planes have an obligation--</p><p>CARLSON: --be a problem for you at all.</p><p>KONST: --to change their standards. That is what policy is all about. If we didn't regulate water--</p><p>CARLSON: So we get solar private planes.</p><p>KONST: --solar private plane - I mean I don't know how that would function. But I think that there are other efficient--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't either.</p><p>KONST: --of energy--</p><p>CARLSON: Name one--</p><p>KONST: --energy use.</p><p>CARLSON: --name - really quick, just for fun, name a renewable energy source that could power--</p><p>KONST: I mean there's--</p><p>CARLSON: --an airplane.</p><p>KONST: --well there's - there's - I mean we see it with cars. We have--</p><p>CARLSON: Hemp? No, I'm - seriously--</p><p>KONST: --you could charge--</p><p>CARLSON: --is there one?</p><p>KONST: --I mean there are - do you - do you know what a Prius is and a Tesla is? You could do that--</p><p>CARLSON: I know (ph) they could power an airplane--</p><p>KONST: --at the level of private planes as such (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --an electric airplane, a big electric airplane.</p><p>KONST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: I mean I am no engineer but I have heard of electric cars--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think--</p><p>KONST: --and airplanes and other forms of electric solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Cool.</p><p>KONST: I mean there's also solar generated so that the electricity that you're charging with--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's solar plant (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --is solar energy--</p><p>CARLSON: We're back to the solar plant, good I'm--</p><p>KONST: --generated or wind generated.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I'm - I'd be excited (ph). Text me a picture, if you find one on the internet. Nomiki, thank you very much.</p><p>KONST: We have to solve this problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>KONST: You can't live in - in another planet.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Columbia students can't take a joke, it turns out. They're the most impressive people our society produces but they have no sense of humor that has kicked a comedian off their campus for telling a very tepid joke.</p><p>Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy tells real jokes and has lived to tell the tale. How does he do it? He joins us next with his answer.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Nimesh Patel works for Saturday Night Live. He is the, in case you're keeping track, the first Indian-American cast member on that show. You'd think that would make him a hero to the pro-diversity crowd. But instead, Patel is a villain tonight. Why? Well he recently made the mistake of going to Columbia University, where all the impressive kids go, and did a comedy set briefly before he was booted off stage.</p><p>He told a joke that began roughly this way. \"Being gay can't be a choice,\" he said, because, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\"</p><p>Now, is that a funny joke? I don't know. Your call. But it's not really attacking anybody. It hardly seems vicious. But you can't say that in 2018. So, the question is, what exactly can you say?</p><p>Well Dave Portnoy seems to say exactly whatever he wants to say all the time. He's the Founder of Barstool Sports. For some reason, it's working for him, if nobody else. He joins us tonight to tell us how he does that.</p><p>Dave, thanks a lot for joining us. So, am I missing--</p><p>DAVID PORTNOY, BARSTOOL SPORTS FOUNDER, BLOGGER, PODCAST HOST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --something. That - that didn't - I didn't think it was a particularly hilarious joke or maybe there was more to it. He got yelled offstage before he could finish. But that didn't seem to me to cross any kind of obvious line, or am I missing the lines, I guess?</p><p>PORTNOY: No. I thought that was a pretty good joke. The name of the event, by the way, I think, was cultureSHOCK: Reclaim. I mean if you go into a comedy club and you have shock in there and that offends you, you probably shouldn't be in the comedy club.</p><p>Very, very odd set of circumstances, to actually being paid, or whatever, to go to this event and be offended by any sort of joke. And like you said, that was - that was a nothing joke. I mean I think it's well-written. But he had to be the most surprised guy in the room.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what's amazing to me is--</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean, really, it's like--</p><p>CARLSON: --this is Columbia, like these are supposed to be the smartest, most sophisticated young people in America, certainly ones with the highest SAT scores. What does it tell you that they have literally no sense of humor?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, I mean that actually doesn't even (ph) surprise me about the Ivy Leagues. I don't know where you went, Tucker. You seem like you'd be an Ivy League guy with a bowtie and all that. But it's a--</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PORTNOY: --but Ivy League guys, I mean the stuff, you know, sense of humor that's kind of the stereotype. But then you have the other side of it. I mean they're certainly like the Harvard Lampoon. They're certainly famous for pushing boundaries and things like that. I don't know what this club was.</p><p>The - it was Asian Allegiance of something. Again, you can't name the event cultureSHOCK, and then, when somebody says a pretty vanilla joke in the schema (ph) jokes, get upset--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PORTNOY: --very odd, very - he - he just had to be shocked like, \"Whoa, what did I say?\" He probably didn't even know.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've asked you this before but I can't get enough of it because I think it's so interesting.</p><p>You run a site, it's one of the most popular and, I would say, also, one of the best on the internet, where you seem to say pretty much exactly what you feel like saying, and all your writers, Francis Ellis, one of my favorites, on your site have the same attitude, and you continue to do it without being forced to stop.</p><p>How do you do that? How do you carve out that freedom in a world where there isn't any freedom?</p><p>PORTNOY: Yes. We built that. Again, we're not a slave to our advertisers. That's a huge thing. So, we don't get caught in the winds of public opinion and things like that, and it works for us.</p><p>And to be honest, we've come to now accept in this environment where people get mad about jokes like that, we're just going to stay true to what we do, and there is a big market for it.</p><p>And there's always going to be haters. And a lot of times the haters don't even know what we do. Tucker, I've been called like anti-Semitic, a million times. I'm Jewish. So, you know, people just don't know what they're--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you--</p><p>PORTNOY: --talking about--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, hold on, wait, what do you say--</p><p>PORTNOY: --but I get that like once a week--</p><p>CARLSON: --when someone says, \"Dave Portnoy, you anti-Semite,\" what - how do you respond to that?</p><p>PORTNOY: It depends what type of mood. Sometime, I'll be like, \"Yes, you're right. You nailed it. I'm like a Nazi or something.\" But it's just - and, again, I'm playing. And people are so crazy, they even (ph) take that out of context.</p><p>So, you know, we are a comedy site. We're comfortable in what we do. But if people don't like something, they feel like they're right. They don't want to hear the other side of the coin. But they'll go out of their way.</p><p>There were pictures of me, Tucker, on this show, and somebody tried to say somehow that made me like anti-Semite. And it's like, \"Dude, I'm Jewish, so what are you talking about?\"</p><p>People just don't really want to look into the context or what's going on. And we've embraced it. And there is a big market for it. And - and I think that makes us more popular in this day and age when people are afraid to say, \"You know, that joke that that guy got booted off stage for, that's ridiculous.\"</p><p>Steve Carell, The Office, my personal favorite comedy, he was on record, I think, a couple weeks ago, he says, The Office couldn't exist now. Two people will get mad.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean that's a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true.</p><p>PORTNOY: That's a true shame.</p><p>CARLSON: But you tell the truth and you're winning anyway. That's why you're an inspiration to the rest of us. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente, great to see you.</p><p>PORTNOY: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: One Democratic lawmaker says she has cracked the code that explains why Democrats aren't winning more seats in the Congress. We'll tell you what she's discovered, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Democrats retook the House in November's elections. But they lost seats in the Senate. And the Blue Wave wasn't quite as big as they hoped it would be. Why did that happen?</p><p>Well, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii says she knows why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: One of the things that we, Democrats, have a really hard time is connecting to people's hearts instead of here.</p><p>We have a really hard time doing that. And one of the reasons that - that was told to me at one of our retreats was that we, Democrats, know so much. That is true.

The Mueller investigation appears to be moving in directions that nobody  could have anticipated, none of them obviously connected to Russian  meddling in the past presidential election. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what is the point of all of this? And when and where does it end, if  ever? Ken Starr and Joe diGenova join us in a moment on that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, freedom of speech. Lot of people voted for Donald Trump  in the hope that they would have more of it. But two years in, the opposite  has happened. A ruling class has clamped down, as never before, on personal  expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gone is the free exchange of ideas we were promised. As Americans, it was  supposed to be our birthright, remember? But in its place now, mandatory  soul-deadening conformity, an entire population forced to repeat the same  mindless platitudes, or else.</p><p>An axis of Left-wing corporate power, academia, the media and lawmakers  have all aligned to curb your right to speak freely, which is to say your  right to think for yourself. When they control your words, they control  your mind.</p><p>The Left used to deny that that was their goal. They're not pretending  anymore. They're baring their teeth and snarling. Get in line or we'll hurt  you. </p><p>In a speech on Monday night, CEO Tim Cook pledged that Apple, one of the  biggest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, will do  whatever it takes to silence dissenting opinion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIMOTHY DONALD COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Hate tries to make its  headquarters in the digital world. At Apple, we believe that technology  needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to  get tied up in knots. That's why we only have one message for those who  seek to push hate, division, and violence, you have no place on our  platforms.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Hate, it's a real thing. There's a lot of it out there right now.  But hate is also the word they use for views they don't like or questions  they can't answer. </p><p>Cook's real message is simple. We are holy. You are fallen. Shut up and  obey. CEOs didn't used to talk like this. They were in the business of  selling products, not preaching sermons. </p><p>Then, over time, conventional religion receded from public life, and people  like Tim Cook and his fellow CEOs stepped forward to fill that void. It was  not an upgrade. Apple has a lot more power than the Episcopal Church ever  had, and much less humility, and much less restraint. </p><p>Leaders a 100 years ago could tolerate dissent. They thought God would sort  it out in the end. They didn't have to. Members of our modern ruling class  consider themselves God. They render their own judgment. They view  disagreement as equivalent to apostasy, an attack on the one true faith.</p><p>In New York, to name but one example, among many, a new bill in the state  legislature would ban anyone who says something politicians don't like from  buying a firearm. </p><p>Prospective gun owners will be required to give up their passwords and to  show their social media accounts to regulators who would inspect them for  unapproved thoughts. Sound like something that Chinese military thought up?  Yes, it does.</p><p>But Democrats are not apologizing for it. Listen to one of the sponsors of  the bill explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: If we make this  law and you have to, you know, allow the - you know, the state government  to, in fact, look at your social media posts, you can decide on whether you  want a pistol license or not. You don't have to have a pistol license.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's true. You don't. You don't have to vote either or go to  church of your choice or be tried by a jury of your peers. What other  constitutional rights will soon be contingent on saying the right things? </p><p>To find out, we've invited Kevin Parker on the show tonight. He is the New  York State Senator from Brooklyn, you just saw on that tape. Senator  Parker, welcome. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>PARKER: Thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should just say at the outset what I'm sure of you (ph) as  already know, which is it's already against federal law to sell firearms to  the mentally ill, thank heaven, and I think all of us support that  restriction. So, it's already against the law.</p><p>But what other constitutional rights that we, as Americans, possess should  be contingent on how we behave on social media?</p><p>PARKER: Well, let's be clear. I take an oath that supports the amendments  and - and the whole Constitution, both the U.S. and the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --the state government Constitution. And so, this is really not  about impinging on constitutional rights. This is really about safety. This  is really about how do we, in fact, make the State of New York as safe as  possible.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: Now, we've already been very safe. We're one of the - the top three  safest states in the entire country, particularly when you look at, you  know, - you know, mass shootings, thank God. </p><p>But we can always be safer, and we can always make sure that what happened  in Pittsburgh, what we saw in Parkland, what we saw in Orlando doesn't  happen here.</p><p>And so, this - this law simply says let's look at, you know, what people  are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a -  a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --because what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Well but then - but - but - but hold on, but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: --and, by the way, I agree with your desire to make your state and  - and every state as safe as - as we possibly can. But why restrict it to  gun owners? </p><p>I mean you are an elected official. You are a State Senator. You wield a  lot of power. You control people's lives. Why shouldn't I have the password  to your social media accounts, so we can assess whether you should be  wielding the power that you do?</p><p>PARKER: Well somebody (ph) should put that law and maybe we can - we could  do that. My, first of all, my social--</p><p>CARLSON: Well no, no, no, but no, but it's a--</p><p>PARKER: --my social media--</p><p>CARLSON: --sincere question. Would you send me - would you send me your  password?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker - Tucker, my social media is open right now. You can go on  it and look at it, anybody can look at it. It's public information.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know. Why don't you-- </p><p>PARKER: So, people can look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send but - but hold on--</p><p>PARKER: --at my social media.</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send me your passwords, and I'll find out how open  it really is.</p><p>PARKER: Well, again - again--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you're requiring gun owners to give you their passwords.  Why shouldn't they turn around and ask you for the same? That's--</p><p>PARKER: Well, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --a sincere question.</p><p>PARKER: --look, what we should be talking about is how do we make the State  of New York safe? And I'm simply saying, right now, we're not as safe as we  can be, because people are saying things on social media, and we're not  using that--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --and looking at that as we, in fact, give out a weapon that can  that - that is used to kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I--</p><p>PARKER: Period (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --I - I - I get what you're saying. I guess I'm just wondering why  we're restricting. I mean as long as, and you've said that privacy is not a  concern, and if you have concerns about privacy, you know, don't - don't  carry a gun, don't buy a gun. </p><p>OK. But you're saying that that's the only category to which this applies.  Why don't we apply it to voting?</p><p>PARKER: Again--</p><p>CARLSON: Before you vote and choose who runs the state, who controls your  life, why shouldn't you have your social media checked? I'm not sure--</p><p>PARKER: Because--</p><p>CARLSON: --I understand.</p><p>PARKER: --because voting doesn't necessarily lead to people killing each  other. This is really about access to guns--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, it does.</p><p>PARKER: --no, this is about access to guns. </p><p>CARLSON: Well no--</p><p>PARKER: And we know that there's a direct correlation with the number of  guns that are available in - in - in states, and the - the - the prevalence  of mass shootings. We also know--</p><p>CARLSON: Well we don't - we - we don't know--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that - we know that - we know that in the -  internationally (ph) as well--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just to let you know (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that internationally (ph) as well.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's actually that's - that's not true. I think Wyoming has  the highest per capita gun ownership in the country. I don't think--</p><p>PARKER: Yes. Yes, with the five people--</p><p>CARLSON: --there were any mass shootings--</p><p>PARKER: --with the five people who live in Wyoming--</p><p>CARLSON: --in Wyoming (ph), right, OK--</p><p>PARKER: --and the guns that they have.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It - OK, but let me just (ph) say--</p><p>PARKER: But when you look at - when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --there is not a correlation--</p><p>PARKER: --when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --between those two things just in--</p><p>PARKER: --there's absolute - there's absolutely--</p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact (ph). </p><p>PARKER: --there's--</p><p>CARLSON: No, there's not, actually.</p><p>PARKER: --absolutely - there's - Tucker-- </p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --there absolutely is. And--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean look at social science center (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we look at places like Japan--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever, OK.</p><p>PARKER: --when we look at places like Japan and we look at--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but this is--</p><p>PARKER: --places like Australia, they have much lower gun violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So, but - but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --and - and especially mass shootings--</p><p>CARLSON: --but the question - the - the question here is--</p><p>PARKER: --exactly because they limit the number of--</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides--</p><p>PARKER: --guns that people have.</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides - no, but you're not calling for limiting the number  of guns in this bill. You're calling for people to turn over their social  media passwords, so you can decide whether they've said things that are  naughty. And if they have, they don't get to own a gun. </p><p>And so, my question is what other constitutional rights are dependent on  your approval? Is the right to abortion? Should we before allowing women to  have abortions check their social media accounts? Sincere question. And if  - if not, why not?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, I'm really focusing on the issue of gun violence. There's  too much gun violence in our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're--</p><p>PARKER: --too much gun violence in--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I can't - I--</p><p>PARKER: --in - across the country.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I agree. I'm against gun violence --</p><p>PARKER: And it's really important that we--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK but--</p><p>PARKER: --that we get it down.</p><p>CARLSON: --but - but hold on, who's going to make this? I mean you're  obviously not--</p><p>PARKER: The state - New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: --engaged in--</p><p>PARKER: --The--</p><p>CARLSON: --the New York State Police.</p><p>PARKER: --New York State - the New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but they'll just decide? Typically before we determine  someone is mentally ill, we adjudicate that person mentally ill. That's  the--</p><p>PARKER: This is - this is - this is not about mental illness.</p><p>CARLSON: --term we use.</p><p>PARKER: This is an addition to--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --the other - in addition--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --in addition to the other criteria that the New York State Police  will use and they already use to determine who should be eligible to get a  gun permit, in addition to that, what I'm saying is, we should also have  the State Police review the social media accounts of the people who--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And take the passwords--</p><p>PARKER: --are making the requests.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. And so, on but what - what would cause this? So, the  State Police, independent of a judge, just get to decide whether you can  have a gun or not based on whether or not they like what you've said on  Facebook.</p><p>PARKER: Well the state - the state - the state--</p><p>CARLSON: And they--</p><p>PARKER: --legislature has the ability with - with the signature of the - of  the Governor to, in fact, make law. And so, we make it the law, we then  can, in fact, subscribe--</p><p>CARLSON: So then you turn over to the--</p><p>PARKER: --the power to the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --police--</p><p>PARKER: --to the state police to make a--</p><p>CARLSON: --you know, it's just - it's just--</p><p>PARKER: --determination--</p><p>CARLSON: --interesting, so you--</p><p>PARKER: --which they do all the time--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --by the way.</p><p>CARLSON: --oh, of course, they do like, yes, the police get to unilaterally  decide whether we can exercise our constitutional rights. You're  comfortable giving the--</p><p>PARKER: No, they're not--</p><p>CARLSON: --police that power.</p><p>PARKER: --unilaterally deciding. </p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you would--</p><p>PARKER: The state - the state legislature's-- </p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PARKER: --actually deciding it--</p><p>CARLSON: The state legislature is handing over--</p><p>PARKER: --which the states are allowed (ph) the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --to them the power--</p><p>PARKER: --no, that's - that's, in fact--</p><p>CARLSON: --to their side (ph).</p><p>PARKER: --not done - exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: So, in every - oh? No, it's--</p><p>PARKER: What we - what we do (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --happening (ph), right.</p><p>PARKER: --but they already have that power right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So--</p><p>PARKER: At this very moment, the State Police decide who gets a gun--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Let me just (ph) ask you a human--</p><p>PARKER: --and who doesn't get a gun.</p><p>CARLSON: --question. Do you think it's a little intrusive that the  government would be forcing citizens to turn over their social media  passwords to the police before doing something that Constitution guarantees  them the right to? That doesn't bother you in any way? That doesn't seem a  little bit, say, totalitarian or something--</p><p>PARKER: Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that maybe China would - would do.</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, we make legislation through a process. All the things that  you have objected to, there are lots of people who object to it. There's  conversations that are going on. Maybe all the--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're - you - I'm sorry. I can't--</p><p>PARKER: --but - I got it but may (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --let you third - skirt the third question in a row.</p><p>PARKER: I'm not - I'm not - I'm not skirting it. I'm saying--</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think it's a little bit--</p><p>PARKER: --what I'm saying to you that--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it's a process. I'm--</p><p>PARKER: --there's an (ph) opportunity for-- </p><p>CARLSON: --I'm aware of how (ph) our government works.</p><p>PARKER: --and I - so there's a--</p><p>CARLSON: But I--</p><p>PARKER: --it's opportunity for us to work together to, in fact, look at  this. Maybe the passwords--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you've written--</p><p>PARKER: --won't play in this (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --this bill.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And these are your proposals.</p><p>PARKER: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is essentially (ph) something that you came up with. And  I'm just asking you, as you sat at your laptop and typed out, you will be  required to hand over your passwords to the State Police. And if they don't  like what you say, you don't get to exercise your rights.</p><p>PARKER: Right now--</p><p>CARLSON: So, part of you think, boy, that sounds--</p><p>PARKER: --you know, right (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --really Orwellian to me--</p><p>PARKER: --right now - right now - right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --like \"Really? We're going to do that?\"</p><p>PARKER: --you're - you're focusing on a part that's actually quite not the  whole bill, right? So, the big thing is to review social media--</p><p>CARLSON: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?</p><p>PARKER: --right?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>PARKER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>PARKER: It's not the--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PARKER: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. But it--</p><p>PARKER: It's not the whole bill--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it is--</p><p>PARKER: --but it's - it's - it's part of it.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. It's part of it. And you don't see that as fascist in  anyway?</p><p>PARKER: And--</p><p>CARLSON: Are there any other decisions that I mean should the State Police  have to sign off on your marriage, do you think, or how many kids you can  have? Would that be - I mean because, obviously, some people shouldn't be  getting married.</p><p>PARKER: Right. But what we'll talk (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Would that be all right?</p><p>PARKER: --what - what we're, again, concerned about is the safety of the  people in the State of New York. And we're concerned that that people are--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --getting - are getting shot down.</p><p>CARLSON: --movie shooting your (ph) point.</p><p>PARKER: It's - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --it's too important (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --guess it's that (ph) obviously.</p><p>PARKER: No, well - no, what I - what I'm doing - what I'm doing is - is  talking about the values. And this and I get that some people--</p><p>CARLSON: What you're doing is scaring me. </p><p>PARKER: --believe that having a gun is more important and then protecting  the lives of strangers--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I think being able to say (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --but in my job as a state legislator to (ph) in fact to do--</p><p>CARLSON: --controversial things online (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --both.</p><p>CARLSON: --it - last question.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things,  maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>CARLSON: It may or may not.</p><p>PARKER: And frankly - and - and frankly--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean they are (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --the Supreme Court has already said that that--</p><p>CARLSON: That if you say something naughty--</p><p>PARKER: --some features (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --then--</p><p>PARKER: --for - for instance - for instance, we - we - we limit, you know,  speech all the time like pornography, particularly, child pornography,  right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well - well child--</p><p>PARKER: We limit - we limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --pornography has not been ruled to be speech.</p><p>PARKER: --but - but among (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And actually, I'd refer you to--</p><p>PARKER: --actually it is (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --Brandenburg versus Ohio 1967, which is the final word on speech  from the Supreme Court, since you're interested, and it allows all speech  except speech that calls for imminent violence--</p><p>PARKER: Ah, like getting a--</p><p>CARLSON: --all speech. They're not exactly (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --like getting a gun and running into a synagogue. Right, that - I  will--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --that imminent violence, right? So--</p><p>CARLSON: That's not speech--</p><p>PARKER: --we effect these (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's violence.</p><p>PARKER: --well, again--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --so then we have--</p><p>CARLSON: You know what?</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Now you're really scaring me--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever of course (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit violence. And I'm saying you limit violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. By limiting the--</p><p>PARKER: --by limiting the kind of--</p><p>CARLSON: --speech.</p><p>PARKER: --limits the violence (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And eliminating privacy, OK--</p><p>PARKER: No. Come on--</p><p>CARLSON: --all right. Come on, give me your password. All right, I'm going  to send you my text. And you text me your Facebook password. I'm going to  assess--</p><p>PARKER: OK. Good (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --what I think of it and we could talk about it tomorrow.</p><p>PARKER: Great. Let's do that--</p><p>CARLSON: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>PARKER: --next time.</p><p>CARLSON: I will send it (ph).</p><p>PARKER: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports lives in a world where you're not allowed  to say what you think. And yet, he says whatever he thinks and thrives. So,  he's just the man to talk to about the battle against free speech that a  lot of us are waging.</p><p>Up next, the press says the Mueller investigation has exposed literally  something called treason by General Mike Flynn. We ask once again, is there  treason? If so, how did he commit it? Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night we got some details from Mueller's prosecutors  about General Michael Flynn's cooperation with the investigation. Mueller  recommended no jail time for Flynn. Most of the report is still redacted.</p><p>So, we really don't know what most of this is about. But some people on  television are very confident that Mike Flynn committed treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIONS OFFICER:  What the Russians did to us was an intelligence operation. It was an  intelligence attack on the core of our democracy. And that's why - what  Flynn did in supporting a candidate who the Russians were helping through  this operation so egregious.</p><p>RALPH PETERS, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL, AUTHOR: As a  former officer, I'd send him to jail for life. He betrayed his country.</p><p>You wind up being torn about it. You know, on a personal level, his life is  already ruined.</p><p>He may be pardonable. But he's - but it's unforgivable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like the dumber you are, the more time you spend on  television. There's got to be a formula. </p><p>Joe diGenova is not dumb. He's a former U.S. Attorney for the District of  Columbia, and he joins us tonight to assess what's actually happening here.  Is there any evidence in the filing last night that General Flynn committed  treason?</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: No.  Actually, those two people you just saw are idiots, and they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --don't know what they're talking about. General Flynn actually  did nothing wrong. The agent said he didn't lie. But Mueller decided he was  going to charge him with lying, anyway.</p><p>Everything that General Flynn did was legal. The - the transition team  communicating with the Russians and other foreign diplomats, perfectly  legal. This was a - this was a designed plot to frame General Flynn so that  they could figure out a way to go after President Trump. </p><p>It's all part of the same theme. This is anybody with a brain can figure  out that Sally Yates had already decided that they were going to frame  General Flynn. And, you know what? They succeeded. They did. They framed  him.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the - the report we got last night from Mueller's team  suggests that Flynn was cooperating in various other ancillary  investigations.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What might those be?</p><p>DIGENOVA: You know, I saw that little - it's a very short pleading. It was  only like--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --six or seven pages. And it had a page that was all dark with  all these ominous things, which allegedly went to the content and the  context of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Is there anything else (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --communications that the--</p><p>CARLSON: there (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --transition team had. Well, there's no evidence that anything  else that he has cooperated on has anything to do with Russian collusion,  the basic premise for this idiotic investigation that Mueller helped set  up. </p><p>And so, the answer is, I have no idea what he's cooperating on, and it  can't be anything of significance. Otherwise, they would have mentioned it  somewhere in their pleadings.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to, like take two steps back, I think you know General  Flynn. I know General Flynn.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes, I do.</p><p>CARLSON: And here you have a guy who ran a Federal Intelligence Agency, who  was a General in the Armed Services who committed perjury, says Robert  Mueller, and whose life has been completely destroyed. Is that an  overstatement?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It's not an overstatement. And, in fact, that was their goal. </p><p>Their goal was to make it impossible for him not to have his life destroyed  so that it - they could have a skin, so that they could show that somebody  did something wrong, who was communicating with a Russian, even though  those communications with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians and  other foreign officials were perfectly legal. </p><p>Sally Yates made up this Logan Act nonsense, which he was not charged with,  nobody's been charged in a 100 years with violating the Logan Act. Perhaps,  they should look at John Kerry.</p><p>The bottom line is this was a frame-up of General Flynn to get Donald  Trump. And, you know what? It almost worked, except there was no collusion.  Mueller knew it when he was appointed. Rod Rosenstein knew there was  collusion when he appointed him.</p><p>CARLSON: The lesson is never plead, fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Always fight.</p><p>CARLSON: Always fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Never give in.</p><p>CARLSON: And don't talk voluntarily, my God.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Take the Fifth.</p><p>CARLSON: Take the--</p><p>DIGENOVA: That's why God made it.</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha. Jim - the Jimmy Hoffa rule. And I, by the way, I'm for  that. Joe diGenova, thank you very much.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr was the Independent Counsel, of course, during the  Clinton Administration, and recently wrote the book, Contempt: A Memoir of  the Clinton Investigation. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --to - to Joe diGenova's point, which I - I think sounds right  that nothing we have seen on earth by the Mueller investigation so far, at  least, pertaining to American citizens, relates to Russian collusion. Does  it bother you that the investigation seems to have gone off on a tangent?</p><p>STARR: I don't think it's a tangent. And I've got a different perspective,  not on the collusion point. I completely agree with Joe. There's nothing  about this that smacks of or even suggests collusion with the Russians. </p><p>But just taking the documents that were filed at face value, and Joe may  call them into question, but just taking them for what they say, they say  that General Flynn lied multiple times to different agencies, different  folks in the Justice Department, including about Turkey, his representation  of Turkey, his representation in terms of why did he write an op-ed piece. </p><p>And you can say, \"Who cares about this?\" Well I will say this, \"Don't lie  to the investigators.\" From what I've seen--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with that.</p><p>STARR: --from what I've seen, there was no perjury trap. He was able to  tell the truth, but for some reason, about issues that he had every reason  to be involved with the Russian Ambassador, issues with respect to  sanctions, the - going forward, what's the relationship going to be with  Russia. </p><p>This is a completely appropriate contact that he had. And so, why he fell  into this pattern, and it's a pattern, apparently. Just, again, I'm taking  what the document says that Mr. Mueller--</p><p>CARLSON: No. Wait, but may--</p><p>STARR: --filed.</p><p>CARLSON: --I stop you there and ask, my understanding is that the  conversation in question with FBI agents that forms the basis of these  charges was a voluntary one at which he did not have a--</p><p>STARR: Correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --lawyer present. Is that correct (ph)? Took place in the White  House and he didn't - I mean, if he understood it was an interview, he  would have had an attorney, correct? But he didn't. So, what does that--</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes it, yes have (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell you?</p><p>STARR: --it - it tells you that for whatever reason, if he made a mistake,  if it's an honest mistake, but that's not what he's pled to.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: He's pled to lying. So, whether it's poor judgment on his part, and  it - and it is. It's an American tragedy. His 33 years of service, five  years combat, Defense Intelligence Agency, so this is someone who's had  this exemplary career. </p><p>And I quite agree this is a hugely tragic. But I don't think it works to  simply say, \"Hey he didn't tell the truth. Who cares?\" And no one said  that. But I think that's the thrust of some of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --critique that we are hearing that--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I think the - but the--</p><p>STARR: --it's OK be--</p><p>CARLSON: --the broader question and I think this--</p><p>STARR: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --this arose during the investigation--</p><p>STARR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you presided over is at what cost to the country. I mean  OK. But I mean--</p><p>STARR: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you, so you empower this guy who basically in real life has  no oversight. Let's not pretend. He doesn't have any oversight. And you  empower him in order to uncover the Russian plot. And then he winds up  threatening people with prison for things that have nothing to do with the  Russian plot, so like how do we benefit from that exactly?</p><p>STARR: And that's a very fair question. The whole Special Counsel  apparatus, the Independent Counsel apparatus, those are fair questions.  Let's talk about those kinds of questions.</p><p>Now, the check that was on me, as Independent Counsel, was, I didn't simply  say, \"Let's go investigate Monica Lewinsky.\" The Attorney General of the  United States made that determination. And I think--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --that's lost on the American people. And so too here--</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's probably true.</p><p>STARR: --yes. And so too here, there are checks you may say, \"Well how much  of a check has it been?\" But right now, the person who is in charge of this  investigation, not day-to-day, is Matt Whitaker, the acting Attorney  General, under the regulations.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: So, let's see. Let's - let's see what unfolds in the coming days.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't think he'll be (ph). Very quickly, Mr. Starr, you knew  President George H.W. Bush for an - an awful long time, 50 years.</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What was your - what was your feeling about the service today?</p><p>STARR: Oh, it was an absolutely gorgeous outpouring. I loved, among other  things, Senator Alan Simpson talking about the road in Washington D.C. of  humility. It's not very crowded. But that's the road that George Herbert  Walker Bush walked on. </p><p>I was overruled by him, by the way, as President of the United States, when  I was serving as Solicitor General. And, you know what? He was very wise  and overruling me. He was right. I wasn't. He was a great man.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, a footnote to history. Ken Starr, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STARR: Hey, thank you, Tucker. My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: The State of California was once the richest state. Today, it's  the poorest state, by far. Why is that? There is a reason. And we've got it  for you, after the break.</p><p>Plus, one of the best sights and sounds from today's funeral for the 41st  President of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNA BUSH HAGER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH,  AMERICAN NEWS PERSONALITY, TEACHER, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: A reading from  Revelation--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for more than a century, California represented everything  that was great about America. In 1849, thousands rode wagons across the  entire continent to participate in the Gold Rush. In the early 1900s, film  directors came by the dozens from the East Coast and made Los Angeles the  center of global film production. </p><p>During the Dust Bowl, thousands of Midwestern farmers found refuge in the  Central Valley. And, of course, for decades, California has been home to  the world's greatest technological innovation. </p><p>It's no accident that California became the country's richest state. It was  a land of limitless opportunity. Even if you never made millions there, you  could live in what was, in effect, a middle-class paradise. </p><p>That's not true anymore. According to the census, almost a fifth of  Californians now live in poverty. That's the highest percentage in the  country. California's middle-class is fleeing to Phoenix and Reno and  Boise. Soon, the state will be comprised almost entirely of rich and poor. </p><p>How did this happen? That question is rarely asked. The answer is pretty  simple. Low-skilled immigration overwhelmed California. More than a quarter  of the state's entire population, as of today, is foreign-born. Again, the  highest rate in the country.</p><p>Some of these immigrants are building successful new companies in Silicon  Valley, good for them. But most of them are not. In fact, the overwhelming  majority of these immigrants are on welfare. </p><p>Fully 72 percent of non-citizen households in the State of California now  receive aid. That compares to just 35 percent of native-born households,  more than double the rate. Now, a 100 years ago, immigrants came to  California for opportunity. And now, they come for the benefits. Who can  blame them? </p><p>Democrats long ago discovered that welfare is a handy vote-buying scheme.  Free stuff equals political power. So, they give more even as native-born  Californians are forced to flee an increasingly unaffordable state.  Democratic lawmakers, even now, are considering a new bill that would give  state-funded health insurance to adult illegal immigrants. </p><p>That means that literally anybody from anywhere on the globe could hop the  border in Tijuana and get healthcare paid for by California taxpayers.  Pretty generous. If only California cared about its own people this much,  it would still be the Golden State.</p><p>Well, President George H.W. Bush was honored today in a state funeral at  the Washington National Cathedral. It was a moving tribute to the country's  41st President. Here's some of the highlights from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was born with  just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and  great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began  to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We  tested his patience. I know I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.</p><p>Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy  answered the phone said he - \"I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said  anything for most of the day.\" I said, \"Dad, I love you, and you've been a  wonderful father.\" And the last words he would ever say on earth were, \"I  love you, too.\"</p><p>We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay  with us forever. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of  knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or  daughter could have.</p><p>And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and  holding Mom's hand again.</p><p>(CROWD APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow. </p><p>Tomorrow, a funeral service for President Bush would be held in Houston,  Texas. Bush 41 will then be laid to rest at his Presidential Library on the  campus of the University - Texas A&amp;M University. Stay with Fox News  throughout the day tomorrow for coverage of that.</p><p>So, riots are taking place in Paris and throughout France. They're about  climate change, and they tell you a lot about the attitudes of the people  in charge. We'll investigate that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for decades now, elites have told the rest of us that they  are deeply, deeply concerned about climate change, much more concerned than  we are, because they're deeper and more thoughtful and compassionate  people.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, for example, deeply concerned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNARD SANDERS, POLITICIAN, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VERMONT: Donald  Trump spoke last night. But somehow, he forgot to mention the words,  \"Climate Change.\" What an outrage?</p><p>Climate change is causing devastating problems in our country and the  world.</p><p>Climate change is the great global environmental crisis that we face.</p><p>In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. </p><p>Yes, Mr. Trump, climate change is real.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's real. And he feels it deeply.</p><p>Over at NBC, by the way, one of their anchors recently wondered if climate  change is so serious that it might render our lives without meaning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATHARINE BEAR TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC LIVE ANCHOR, AUTHOR:  Fires, flood, storms, famine, the effects of climate change are all around  us. And according to a new essay penned by Bill McKibben, it is shrink - it  is shrinking our world. Not livably - not literally, excuse me, but  livably.</p><p>I read that New Yorker article today and I thought \"Gosh, how pointless is  my life, and how pointless is the - are the decisions that I'm making on a  day-to-day basis when we are not focused on climate change every day, when  it's not leading every one of our newscasts?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. In other words, if it's not about climate change it doesn't  really matter. So, let's take this seriously just for a second. Why not?  They're always telling us. Let's take what they say at face value.</p><p>They care deeply about climate change. But if they care as deeply as they  say they do, if they believe the destruction of the planet is as imminent  as they say it is, why are they living the way that they do?</p><p>You just saw the tape of Bernie Sanders. He cares a lot. And yet a (ph)  news story came out today that said he spent $300,000 in a single month  flying on a private plane. Huh? </p><p>How could he do that? How could any of them own second homes, if they  really believe climate change is real? How are they using a car service  when they could use mass transit? Why aren't they all vegans? Why aren't  they living what they say they believe? They're not.</p><p>The solutions they suggest, and this is not unrelated, are almost always  going to be paid for by other people. The most regressive kinds of taxes,  energy taxes, imposed on the masses. Well, as the riots in Paris show, the  masses aren't into this. And why would they be?</p><p>Nomiki Konst is a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, and she  joins us tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on. So--</p><p>NOMIKI KONST, CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: Hi, Tucker. How  you're doing?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm great. So, most - but I'm a little bit confused. So, mostly,  debates about climate change or one person saying it's real and the other  one's like--</p><p>KONST: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --ah, we don't really have all the evidence. Granted, I grant  everything you say about climate change. I'm just - just for the sake of  this conversation.</p><p>KONST: Well thank you, that's a start.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, OK--</p><p>KONST: You admit it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --but if you really believe what you're saying, and if Bernie  Sanders really believes what he's saying, then why is he flying on private  planes? I mean I'm - this is sincere question.</p><p>KONST: So, let's not get distracted from the real issue here, what--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>KONST: --the real issue--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not going to - stop, stop, stop. I'm not going to let you  off that easily. </p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is it not a real issue? If climate change, as Katy Tur just  told us, is really the only--</p><p>KONST: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --issue that matters, then why aren't we living like it's the only  issue that matters?</p><p>KONST: Because it really comes down--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't understand.</p><p>KONST: --to the industry. If the industry wants to make planes that exist  off of renewable energy rather than - than oil and gas, then we will all be  able to live on this planet. It starts at the industry level, not the  consumer. You know, it's not fair--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So - so the individual--</p><p>KONST: --to put the tax--</p><p>CARLSON: --oh it - it's not--</p><p>KONST: --on the individual.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not fair--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --for someone who's telling us the planet's being destroyed to  live in a way that suggests that he actually believes the planet's being  destroyed. So, I don't - I don't - I honestly I really don't get it. </p><p>So, if you're Al Gore and you say, \"Nothing is more important than climate  change. I'm a better person than you are because I care more than you. By  the way, I have one of the largest houses in Nashville and I fly private,  and I take a suburban to the private Airport, to the FBO,\" why should I be  OK?</p><p>I mean, I'm - sincerely, why don't--</p><p>KONST: Because that is not going to solve--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that OK?</p><p>KONST: --individual choices are not going to solve the disaster that we are  facing. We already have a migration issue.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>KONST: We already have flooding. We already have hurricanes like--</p><p>CARLSON: Why aren't--</p><p>KONST: --that have hit Puerto Rico, have hit - have hit New Orleans, have  hit Florida, and have displaced--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --so many working people. This is an industry change. We have to cap  emissions globally.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on. But hold on, then why are we--</p><p>KONST: And if we don't cap emissions--</p><p>CARLSON: --then why are--</p><p>KONST: --with big industries and policy--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --then those individual choices mean nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well first of all--</p><p>KONST: You have to change the standards.</p><p>CARLSON: --first of all, hold on, first of all, individual choices always  mean something.</p><p>KONST: In a libertarian's-- </p><p>CARLSON: Only it sees (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --fantasy world, sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Not - I'm not - I'm not a libertarian. And I'm not living in a  fantasy world. In real life, individual choices matter or else what's the  point of any of this, OK? So, it does start - well Liberals used to say it  starts with one person. </p><p>I guess they don't anymore because they don't want to be held to their own  standards. But the solutions are always like ordinary working people ought  to pay higher gas taxes--</p><p>KONST: It's not the solution at all.</p><p>CARLSON: --but I get--</p><p>KONST: And, actually, we are against that. Progressives versus the  neoliberals and neocons, progressives understand that this needs to be a  huge policy change. With the place where we are right now, if we increase  the temperature one degree, you and I won't be living in D.C., in New York  anymore. </p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but hold on - hold on--</p><p>KONST: We will be displaced.</p><p>CARLSON: --but no, no, I want to talk about the--</p><p>KONST: And industries will lose money.</p><p>CARLSON: --public policy. OK--</p><p>KONST: Yes, public policy.</p><p>CARLSON: --I want to talk about the public policy--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --solutions that will flow from the predictions that you're  making. Is there any solution you've ever heard of that doesn't increase  the price of energy?</p><p>KONST: Absolutely (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I've never heard of one.</p><p>KONST: Well, OK. So, if you're going to be focused on the price of energy,  we're not going to have a plan--</p><p>CARLSON: Well because--</p><p>KONST: --in 10 years.</p><p>CARLSON: --well hold on--</p><p>KONST: We have to talk about changing--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait hold on--</p><p>KONST: --but let me finish--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared--</p><p>KONST: --Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared about working people. And with--</p><p>KONST: We're going down a rabbit hole. I want to talk about the solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not.</p><p>KONST: The solution would be a Green New Deal, moving to 100 percent  renewable energy, forcing the companies that are jacking up the prices on  working people--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --to actually reduce their emissions, so that working people aren't  displaced, so working people--</p><p>CARLSON: But can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --don't have to pay the cost of hurricane damage--</p><p>CARLSON: Can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --and have clean water--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --and the water's not being privatized.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Volume is not the same as an argument, OK? So, just really  simple question, would your solution--</p><p>PARKER: You don't like opinion of women, do you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I live with four of them.</p><p>KONST: Volume.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to go, \"You're a sexist now\"--</p><p>KONST: You're pretty loud. My ear piece is--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. OK.</p><p>KONST: --blaring right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just ask you a really simple question. Would the  solutions that you're espousing now--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --would they raise the price of gasoline for wage earners, the  ones--</p><p>KONST: Not with the Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: --you claim to care about.</p><p>KONST: I'm actually against--</p><p>CARLSON: It wouldn't. Gas would be the same price.</p><p>KONST: --I am against raising consumer prices. That is a neoliberal design.  I am a Democratic Socialist. I think we should pass policies and actually  make rich people, millionaires and billionaires, and corporations, pay  taxes. That's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: No one at the top is paying taxes and the--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but you would allow--</p><p>KONST: --burden is going to the consumer.</p><p>CARLSON: --but you would allow private planes to fly, I guess, right? That  wouldn't--</p><p>KONST: I think private planes have an obligation--</p><p>CARLSON: --be a problem for you at all.</p><p>KONST: --to change their standards. That is what policy is all about. If we  didn't regulate water--</p><p>CARLSON: So we get solar private planes.</p><p>KONST: --solar private plane - I mean I don't know how that would function.  But I think that there are other efficient--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't either.</p><p>KONST: --of energy--</p><p>CARLSON: Name one--</p><p>KONST: --energy use.</p><p>CARLSON: --name - really quick, just for fun, name a renewable energy  source that could power--</p><p>KONST: I mean there's--</p><p>CARLSON: --an airplane.</p><p>KONST: --well there's - there's - I mean we see it with cars. We have--</p><p>CARLSON: Hemp? No, I'm - seriously--</p><p>KONST: --you could charge--</p><p>CARLSON: --is there one?</p><p>KONST: --I mean there are - do you - do you know what a Prius is and a  Tesla is? You could do that--</p><p>CARLSON: I know (ph) they could power an airplane--</p><p>KONST: --at the level of private planes as such (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --an electric airplane, a big electric airplane.</p><p>KONST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: I mean I am no engineer but I have heard of electric cars--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think--</p><p>KONST: --and airplanes and other forms of electric solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Cool.</p><p>KONST: I mean there's also solar generated so that the electricity that  you're charging with--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's solar plant (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --is solar energy--</p><p>CARLSON: We're back to the solar plant, good I'm--</p><p>KONST: --generated or wind generated.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I'm - I'd be excited (ph). Text me a picture, if you find  one on the internet. Nomiki, thank you very much.</p><p>KONST: We have to solve this problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>KONST: You can't live in - in another planet.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Columbia students can't take a joke, it turns out. They're the most  impressive people our society produces but they have no sense of humor that  has kicked a comedian off their campus for telling a very tepid joke.</p><p>Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy tells real jokes and has lived to tell the  tale. How does he do it? He joins us next with his answer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Nimesh Patel works for Saturday Night Live. He is the, in  case you're keeping track, the first Indian-American cast member on that  show. You'd think that would make him a hero to the pro-diversity crowd.  But instead, Patel is a villain tonight. Why?  Well he recently made the mistake of going to Columbia University, where  all the impressive kids go, and did a comedy set briefly before he was  booted off stage. </p><p>He told a joke that began roughly this way. \"Being gay can't be a choice,\"  he said, because, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, this black thing  is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\" </p><p>Now, is that a funny joke? I don't know. Your call. But it's not really  attacking anybody. It hardly seems vicious. But you can't say that in 2018.  So, the question is, what exactly can you say?</p><p>Well Dave Portnoy seems to say exactly whatever he wants to say all the  time. He's the Founder of Barstool Sports. For some reason, it's working  for him, if nobody else. He joins us tonight to tell us how he does that.</p><p>Dave, thanks a lot for joining us. So, am I missing--</p><p>DAVID PORTNOY, BARSTOOL SPORTS FOUNDER, BLOGGER, PODCAST HOST: Thanks for  having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --something. That - that didn't - I didn't think it was a  particularly hilarious joke or maybe there was more to it. He got yelled  offstage before he could finish. But that didn't seem to me to cross any  kind of obvious line, or am I missing the lines, I guess?</p><p>PORTNOY: No. I thought that was a pretty good joke. The name of the event,  by the way, I think, was cultureSHOCK: Reclaim. I mean if you go into a  comedy club and you have shock in there and that offends you, you probably  shouldn't be in the comedy club. </p><p>Very, very odd set of circumstances, to actually being paid, or whatever,  to go to this event and be offended by any sort of joke. And like you said,  that was - that was a nothing joke. I mean I think it's well-written. But  he had to be the most surprised guy in the room.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what's amazing to me is--</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean, really, it's like--</p><p>CARLSON: --this is Columbia, like these are supposed to be the smartest,  most sophisticated young people in America, certainly ones with the highest  SAT scores. What does it tell you that they have literally no sense of  humor?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, I mean that actually doesn't even (ph) surprise me about the  Ivy Leagues. I don't know where you went, Tucker. You seem like you'd be an  Ivy League guy with a bowtie and all that. But it's a--</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PORTNOY: --but Ivy League guys, I mean the stuff, you know, sense of humor  that's kind of the stereotype. But then you have the other side of it. I  mean they're certainly like the Harvard Lampoon. They're certainly famous  for pushing boundaries and things like that. I don't know what this club  was.</p><p>The - it was Asian Allegiance of something. Again, you can't name the event  cultureSHOCK, and then, when somebody says a pretty vanilla joke in the  schema (ph) jokes, get upset--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PORTNOY: --very odd, very - he - he just had to be shocked like, \"Whoa,  what did I say?\" He probably didn't even know.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've asked you this before but I can't get enough of it  because I think it's so interesting. </p><p>You run a site, it's one of the most popular and, I would say, also, one of  the best on the internet, where you seem to say pretty much exactly what  you feel like saying, and all your writers, Francis Ellis, one of my  favorites, on your site have the same attitude, and you continue to do it  without being forced to stop. </p><p>How do you do that? How do you carve out that freedom in a world where  there isn't any freedom?</p><p>PORTNOY: Yes. We built that. Again, we're not a slave to our advertisers.  That's a huge thing. So, we don't get caught in the winds of public opinion  and things like that, and it works for us. </p><p>And to be honest, we've come to now accept in this environment where people  get mad about jokes like that, we're just going to stay true to what we do,  and there is a big market for it. </p><p>And there's always going to be haters. And a lot of times the haters don't  even know what we do. Tucker, I've been called like anti-Semitic, a million  times. I'm Jewish. So, you know, people just don't know what they're--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you--</p><p>PORTNOY: --talking about--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, hold on, wait, what do you say--</p><p>PORTNOY: --but I get that like once a week--</p><p>CARLSON: --when someone says, \"Dave Portnoy, you anti-Semite,\" what - how  do you respond to that?</p><p>PORTNOY: It depends what type of mood. Sometime, I'll be like, \"Yes, you're  right. You nailed it. I'm like a Nazi or something.\" But it's just - and,  again, I'm playing. And people are so crazy, they even (ph) take that out  of context. </p><p>So, you know, we are a comedy site. We're comfortable in what we do. But if  people don't like something, they feel like they're right. They don't want  to hear the other side of the coin. But they'll go out of their way. </p><p>There were pictures of me, Tucker, on this show, and somebody tried to say  somehow that made me like anti-Semite. And it's like, \"Dude, I'm Jewish, so  what are you talking about?\" </p><p>People just don't really want to look into the context or what's going on.  And we've embraced it. And there is a big market for it. And - and I think  that makes us more popular in this day and age when people are afraid to  say, \"You know, that joke that that guy got booted off stage for, that's  ridiculous.\"</p><p>Steve Carell, The Office, my personal favorite comedy, he was on record, I  think, a couple weeks ago, he says, The Office couldn't exist now. Two  people will get mad.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean that's a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true.</p><p>PORTNOY: That's a true shame.</p><p>CARLSON: But you tell the truth and you're winning anyway. That's why  you're an inspiration to the rest of us. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente, great  to see you.</p><p>PORTNOY: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: One Democratic lawmaker says she has cracked the code that  explains why Democrats aren't winning more seats in the Congress. We'll  tell you what she's discovered, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well Democrats retook the House in November's elections. But they  lost seats in the Senate. And the Blue Wave wasn't quite as big as they  hoped it would be. Why did that happen?</p><p>Well, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii says she knows why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER: One of the things that we, Democrats, have a really hard time is  connecting to people's hearts instead of here.</p><p>We have a really hard time doing that. And one of the reasons that - that  was told to me at one of our retreats was that we, Democrats, know so much.  That is true. And we have to kind of tell everybody how smart we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We're just too smart. We care too much. We're too erudite. We  believe in science, except biology and ultrasounds. We're just too good.  America doesn't deserve us. </p><p>This is the person who said she knew Kavanaugh was guilty of rape because  he was a man. Just too smart. Amazing! What a world?</p><p>That's the end of our hour. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 P.M., the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. </p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity, live from New York.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: All right. I'm not that smart, just saying.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>HANNITY: I'm not - I'm not making that claim.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not that of (ph) that smart either, oh my God.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Mueller investigation appears to be moving in directions that nobody  could have anticipated, none of them obviously connected to Russian  meddling in the past presidential election. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what is the point of all of this? And when and where does it end, if  ever? Ken Starr and Joe diGenova join us in a moment on that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first tonight, freedom of speech. Lot of people voted for Donald Trump  in the hope that they would have more of it. But two years in, the opposite  has happened. A ruling class has clamped down, as never before, on personal  expression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gone is the free exchange of ideas we were promised. As Americans, it was  supposed to be our birthright, remember? But in its place now, mandatory  soul-deadening conformity, an entire population forced to repeat the same  mindless platitudes, or else.</p><p>An axis of Left-wing corporate power, academia, the media and lawmakers  have all aligned to curb your right to speak freely, which is to say your  right to think for yourself. When they control your words, they control  your mind.</p><p>The Left used to deny that that was their goal. They're not pretending  anymore. They're baring their teeth and snarling. Get in line or we'll hurt  you. </p><p>In a speech on Monday night, CEO Tim Cook pledged that Apple, one of the  biggest and most powerful companies in the history of the world, will do  whatever it takes to silence dissenting opinion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TIMOTHY DONALD COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Hate tries to make its  headquarters in the digital world. At Apple, we believe that technology  needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to  get tied up in knots. That's why we only have one message for those who  seek to push hate, division, and violence, you have no place on our  platforms.</p><p>(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Hate, it's a real thing. There's a lot of it out there right now.  But hate is also the word they use for views they don't like or questions  they can't answer. </p><p>Cook's real message is simple. We are holy. You are fallen. Shut up and  obey. CEOs didn't used to talk like this. They were in the business of  selling products, not preaching sermons. </p><p>Then, over time, conventional religion receded from public life, and people  like Tim Cook and his fellow CEOs stepped forward to fill that void. It was  not an upgrade. Apple has a lot more power than the Episcopal Church ever  had, and much less humility, and much less restraint. </p><p>Leaders a 100 years ago could tolerate dissent. They thought God would sort  it out in the end. They didn't have to. Members of our modern ruling class  consider themselves God. They render their own judgment. They view  disagreement as equivalent to apostasy, an attack on the one true faith.</p><p>In New York, to name but one example, among many, a new bill in the state  legislature would ban anyone who says something politicians don't like from  buying a firearm. </p><p>Prospective gun owners will be required to give up their passwords and to  show their social media accounts to regulators who would inspect them for  unapproved thoughts. Sound like something that Chinese military thought up?  Yes, it does.</p><p>But Democrats are not apologizing for it. Listen to one of the sponsors of  the bill explain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN PARKER, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER: If we make this  law and you have to, you know, allow the - you know, the state government  to, in fact, look at your social media posts, you can decide on whether you  want a pistol license or not. You don't have to have a pistol license.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's true. You don't. You don't have to vote either or go to  church of your choice or be tried by a jury of your peers. What other  constitutional rights will soon be contingent on saying the right things? </p><p>To find out, we've invited Kevin Parker on the show tonight. He is the New  York State Senator from Brooklyn, you just saw on that tape. Senator  Parker, welcome. Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>PARKER: Thanks for having me on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should just say at the outset what I'm sure of you (ph) as  already know, which is it's already against federal law to sell firearms to  the mentally ill, thank heaven, and I think all of us support that  restriction. So, it's already against the law.</p><p>But what other constitutional rights that we, as Americans, possess should  be contingent on how we behave on social media?</p><p>PARKER: Well, let's be clear. I take an oath that supports the amendments  and - and the whole Constitution, both the U.S. and the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --the state government Constitution. And so, this is really not  about impinging on constitutional rights. This is really about safety. This  is really about how do we, in fact, make the State of New York as safe as  possible.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: Now, we've already been very safe. We're one of the - the top three  safest states in the entire country, particularly when you look at, you  know, - you know, mass shootings, thank God. </p><p>But we can always be safer, and we can always make sure that what happened  in Pittsburgh, what we saw in Parkland, what we saw in Orlando doesn't  happen here.</p><p>And so, this - this law simply says let's look at, you know, what people  are putting out on social media as a, you know, the - you know, part of a -  a set of criteria that we're using to determine who gets handguns--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --because what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: Well but then - but - but - but hold on, but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --what we've--</p><p>CARLSON: --and, by the way, I agree with your desire to make your state and  - and every state as safe as - as we possibly can. But why restrict it to  gun owners? </p><p>I mean you are an elected official. You are a State Senator. You wield a  lot of power. You control people's lives. Why shouldn't I have the password  to your social media accounts, so we can assess whether you should be  wielding the power that you do?</p><p>PARKER: Well somebody (ph) should put that law and maybe we can - we could  do that. My, first of all, my social--</p><p>CARLSON: Well no, no, no, but no, but it's a--</p><p>PARKER: --my social media--</p><p>CARLSON: --sincere question. Would you send me - would you send me your  password?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker - Tucker, my social media is open right now. You can go on  it and look at it, anybody can look at it. It's public information.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know. Why don't you-- </p><p>PARKER: So, people can look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send but - but hold on--</p><p>PARKER: --at my social media.</p><p>CARLSON: --why don't you send me your passwords, and I'll find out how open  it really is.</p><p>PARKER: Well, again - again--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you're requiring gun owners to give you their passwords.  Why shouldn't they turn around and ask you for the same? That's--</p><p>PARKER: Well, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --a sincere question.</p><p>PARKER: --look, what we should be talking about is how do we make the State  of New York safe? And I'm simply saying, right now, we're not as safe as we  can be, because people are saying things on social media, and we're not  using that--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PARKER: --and looking at that as we, in fact, give out a weapon that can  that - that is used to kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But I--</p><p>PARKER: Period (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --I - I - I get what you're saying. I guess I'm just wondering why  we're restricting. I mean as long as, and you've said that privacy is not a  concern, and if you have concerns about privacy, you know, don't - don't  carry a gun, don't buy a gun. </p><p>OK. But you're saying that that's the only category to which this applies.  Why don't we apply it to voting?</p><p>PARKER: Again--</p><p>CARLSON: Before you vote and choose who runs the state, who controls your  life, why shouldn't you have your social media checked? I'm not sure--</p><p>PARKER: Because--</p><p>CARLSON: --I understand.</p><p>PARKER: --because voting doesn't necessarily lead to people killing each  other. This is really about access to guns--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, it does.</p><p>PARKER: --no, this is about access to guns. </p><p>CARLSON: Well no--</p><p>PARKER: And we know that there's a direct correlation with the number of  guns that are available in - in - in states, and the - the - the prevalence  of mass shootings. We also know--</p><p>CARLSON: Well we don't - we - we don't know--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that - we know that - we know that in the -  internationally (ph) as well--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just to let you know (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we know that internationally (ph) as well.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's actually that's - that's not true. I think Wyoming has  the highest per capita gun ownership in the country. I don't think--</p><p>PARKER: Yes. Yes, with the five people--</p><p>CARLSON: --there were any mass shootings--</p><p>PARKER: --with the five people who live in Wyoming--</p><p>CARLSON: --in Wyoming (ph), right, OK--</p><p>PARKER: --and the guns that they have.</p><p>CARLSON: No. It - OK, but let me just (ph) say--</p><p>PARKER: But when you look at - when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --there is not a correlation--</p><p>PARKER: --when you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: --between those two things just in--</p><p>PARKER: --there's absolute - there's absolutely--</p><p>CARLSON: --just in point of fact (ph). </p><p>PARKER: --there's--</p><p>CARLSON: No, there's not, actually.</p><p>PARKER: --absolutely - there's - Tucker-- </p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>PARKER: --there absolutely is. And--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean look at social science center (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --we look at places like Japan--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever, OK.</p><p>PARKER: --when we look at places like Japan and we look at--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but this is--</p><p>PARKER: --places like Australia, they have much lower gun violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So, but - but - but--</p><p>PARKER: --and - and especially mass shootings--</p><p>CARLSON: --but the question - the - the question here is--</p><p>PARKER: --exactly because they limit the number of--</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides--</p><p>PARKER: --guns that people have.</p><p>CARLSON: --who decides - no, but you're not calling for limiting the number  of guns in this bill. You're calling for people to turn over their social  media passwords, so you can decide whether they've said things that are  naughty. And if they have, they don't get to own a gun. </p><p>And so, my question is what other constitutional rights are dependent on  your approval? Is the right to abortion? Should we before allowing women to  have abortions check their social media accounts? Sincere question. And if  - if not, why not?</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, I'm really focusing on the issue of gun violence. There's  too much gun violence in our communities--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're--</p><p>PARKER: --too much gun violence in--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm sorry. I can't - I--</p><p>PARKER: --in - across the country.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I agree. I'm against gun violence --</p><p>PARKER: And it's really important that we--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK but--</p><p>PARKER: --that we get it down.</p><p>CARLSON: --but - but hold on, who's going to make this? I mean you're  obviously not--</p><p>PARKER: The state - New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: --engaged in--</p><p>PARKER: --The--</p><p>CARLSON: --the New York State Police.</p><p>PARKER: --New York State - the New York State Police.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but they'll just decide? Typically before we determine  someone is mentally ill, we adjudicate that person mentally ill. That's  the--</p><p>PARKER: This is - this is - this is not about mental illness.</p><p>CARLSON: --term we use.</p><p>PARKER: This is an addition to--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --the other - in addition--</p><p>CARLSON: What is it about?</p><p>PARKER: --in addition to the other criteria that the New York State Police  will use and they already use to determine who should be eligible to get a  gun permit, in addition to that, what I'm saying is, we should also have  the State Police review the social media accounts of the people who--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. And take the passwords--</p><p>PARKER: --are making the requests.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. And so, on but what - what would cause this? So, the  State Police, independent of a judge, just get to decide whether you can  have a gun or not based on whether or not they like what you've said on  Facebook.</p><p>PARKER: Well the state - the state - the state--</p><p>CARLSON: And they--</p><p>PARKER: --legislature has the ability with - with the signature of the - of  the Governor to, in fact, make law. And so, we make it the law, we then  can, in fact, subscribe--</p><p>CARLSON: So then you turn over to the--</p><p>PARKER: --the power to the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --police--</p><p>PARKER: --to the state police to make a--</p><p>CARLSON: --you know, it's just - it's just--</p><p>PARKER: --determination--</p><p>CARLSON: --interesting, so you--</p><p>PARKER: --which they do all the time--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --by the way.</p><p>CARLSON: --oh, of course, they do like, yes, the police get to unilaterally  decide whether we can exercise our constitutional rights. You're  comfortable giving the--</p><p>PARKER: No, they're not--</p><p>CARLSON: --police that power.</p><p>PARKER: --unilaterally deciding. </p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you would--</p><p>PARKER: The state - the state legislature's-- </p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PARKER: --actually deciding it--</p><p>CARLSON: The state legislature is handing over--</p><p>PARKER: --which the states are allowed (ph) the state--</p><p>CARLSON: --to them the power--</p><p>PARKER: --no, that's - that's, in fact--</p><p>CARLSON: --to their side (ph).</p><p>PARKER: --not done - exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: So, in every - oh? No, it's--</p><p>PARKER: What we - what we do (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --happening (ph), right.</p><p>PARKER: --but they already have that power right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. OK. So--</p><p>PARKER: At this very moment, the State Police decide who gets a gun--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Let me just (ph) ask you a human--</p><p>PARKER: --and who doesn't get a gun.</p><p>CARLSON: --question. Do you think it's a little intrusive that the  government would be forcing citizens to turn over their social media  passwords to the police before doing something that Constitution guarantees  them the right to? That doesn't bother you in any way? That doesn't seem a  little bit, say, totalitarian or something--</p><p>PARKER: Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --that maybe China would - would do.</p><p>PARKER: Tucker, we make legislation through a process. All the things that  you have objected to, there are lots of people who object to it. There's  conversations that are going on. Maybe all the--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But you're - you - I'm sorry. I can't--</p><p>PARKER: --but - I got it but may (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --let you third - skirt the third question in a row.</p><p>PARKER: I'm not - I'm not - I'm not skirting it. I'm saying--</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think it's a little bit--</p><p>PARKER: --what I'm saying to you that--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it's a process. I'm--</p><p>PARKER: --there's an (ph) opportunity for-- </p><p>CARLSON: --I'm aware of how (ph) our government works.</p><p>PARKER: --and I - so there's a--</p><p>CARLSON: But I--</p><p>PARKER: --it's opportunity for us to work together to, in fact, look at  this. Maybe the passwords--</p><p>CARLSON: You're - you've written--</p><p>PARKER: --won't play in this (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --this bill.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And these are your proposals.</p><p>PARKER: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is essentially (ph) something that you came up with. And  I'm just asking you, as you sat at your laptop and typed out, you will be  required to hand over your passwords to the State Police. And if they don't  like what you say, you don't get to exercise your rights.</p><p>PARKER: Right now--</p><p>CARLSON: So, part of you think, boy, that sounds--</p><p>PARKER: --you know, right (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --really Orwellian to me--</p><p>PARKER: --right now - right now - right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --like \"Really? We're going to do that?\"</p><p>PARKER: --you're - you're focusing on a part that's actually quite not the  whole bill, right? So, the big thing is to review social media--</p><p>CARLSON: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?</p><p>PARKER: --right?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>PARKER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>PARKER: It's not the--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PARKER: --it's not the whole bill.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. But it--</p><p>PARKER: It's not the whole bill--</p><p>CARLSON: --but it is--</p><p>PARKER: --but it's - it's - it's part of it.</p><p>CARLSON: --right. It's part of it. And you don't see that as fascist in  anyway?</p><p>PARKER: And--</p><p>CARLSON: Are there any other decisions that I mean should the State Police  have to sign off on your marriage, do you think, or how many kids you can  have? Would that be - I mean because, obviously, some people shouldn't be  getting married.</p><p>PARKER: Right. But what we'll talk (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Would that be all right?</p><p>PARKER: --what - what we're, again, concerned about is the safety of the  people in the State of New York. And we're concerned that that people are--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --getting - are getting shot down.</p><p>CARLSON: --movie shooting your (ph) point.</p><p>PARKER: It's - it's--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not going to--</p><p>PARKER: --it's too important (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --guess it's that (ph) obviously.</p><p>PARKER: No, well - no, what I - what I'm doing - what I'm doing is - is  talking about the values. And this and I get that some people--</p><p>CARLSON: What you're doing is scaring me. </p><p>PARKER: --believe that having a gun is more important and then protecting  the lives of strangers--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I think being able to say (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --but in my job as a state legislator to (ph) in fact to do--</p><p>CARLSON: --controversial things online (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --both.</p><p>CARLSON: --it - last question.</p><p>PARKER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think that people have a right to say outrageous things,  maybe even things you disagree with, in public, do you think--</p><p>PARKER: They - they certainly--</p><p>CARLSON: --that that be good (ph)?</p><p>PARKER: --they certainly can say whatever they want to say. But we also  have the right--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, but then you punish them--</p><p>PARKER: --we also have--</p><p>CARLSON: --for saying that.</p><p>PARKER: --but we also have a right to deny them a gun permit if, in fact,  we believe that the things that they're saying may lead to them endangering  the people of the State of New York.</p><p>CARLSON: It may or may not.</p><p>PARKER: And frankly - and - and frankly--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean they are (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --the Supreme Court has already said that that--</p><p>CARLSON: That if you say something naughty--</p><p>PARKER: --some features (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --then--</p><p>PARKER: --for - for instance - for instance, we - we - we limit, you know,  speech all the time like pornography, particularly, child pornography,  right?</p><p>CARLSON: Well - well child--</p><p>PARKER: We limit - we limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --pornography has not been ruled to be speech.</p><p>PARKER: --but - but among (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And actually, I'd refer you to--</p><p>PARKER: --actually it is (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --Brandenburg versus Ohio 1967, which is the final word on speech  from the Supreme Court, since you're interested, and it allows all speech  except speech that calls for imminent violence--</p><p>PARKER: Ah, like getting a--</p><p>CARLSON: --all speech. They're not exactly (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --like getting a gun and running into a synagogue. Right, that - I  will--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --that imminent violence, right? So--</p><p>CARLSON: That's not speech--</p><p>PARKER: --we effect these (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's violence.</p><p>PARKER: --well, again--</p><p>CARLSON: Please.</p><p>PARKER: --so then we have--</p><p>CARLSON: You know what?</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Now you're really scaring me--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit--</p><p>CARLSON: --whatever of course (ph)--</p><p>PARKER: --so we have to limit violence. And I'm saying you limit violence--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. By limiting the--</p><p>PARKER: --by limiting the kind of--</p><p>CARLSON: --speech.</p><p>PARKER: --limits the violence (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: And eliminating privacy, OK--</p><p>PARKER: No. Come on--</p><p>CARLSON: --all right. Come on, give me your password. All right, I'm going  to send you my text. And you text me your Facebook password. I'm going to  assess--</p><p>PARKER: OK. Good (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --what I think of it and we could talk about it tomorrow.</p><p>PARKER: Great. Let's do that--</p><p>CARLSON: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>PARKER: --next time.</p><p>CARLSON: I will send it (ph).</p><p>PARKER: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports lives in a world where you're not allowed  to say what you think. And yet, he says whatever he thinks and thrives. So,  he's just the man to talk to about the battle against free speech that a  lot of us are waging.</p><p>Up next, the press says the Mueller investigation has exposed literally  something called treason by General Mike Flynn. We ask once again, is there  treason? If so, how did he commit it? Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night we got some details from Mueller's prosecutors  about General Michael Flynn's cooperation with the investigation. Mueller  recommended no jail time for Flynn. Most of the report is still redacted.</p><p>So, we really don't know what most of this is about. But some people on  television are very confident that Mike Flynn committed treason.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID EVAN MCMULLIN, FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OPERATIONS OFFICER:  What the Russians did to us was an intelligence operation. It was an  intelligence attack on the core of our democracy. And that's why - what  Flynn did in supporting a candidate who the Russians were helping through  this operation so egregious.</p><p>RALPH PETERS, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL, AUTHOR: As a  former officer, I'd send him to jail for life. He betrayed his country.</p><p>You wind up being torn about it. You know, on a personal level, his life is  already ruined.</p><p>He may be pardonable. But he's - but it's unforgivable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's almost like the dumber you are, the more time you spend on  television. There's got to be a formula. </p><p>Joe diGenova is not dumb. He's a former U.S. Attorney for the District of  Columbia, and he joins us tonight to assess what's actually happening here.  Is there any evidence in the filing last night that General Flynn committed  treason?</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: No.  Actually, those two people you just saw are idiots, and they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --don't know what they're talking about. General Flynn actually  did nothing wrong. The agent said he didn't lie. But Mueller decided he was  going to charge him with lying, anyway.</p><p>Everything that General Flynn did was legal. The - the transition team  communicating with the Russians and other foreign diplomats, perfectly  legal. This was a - this was a designed plot to frame General Flynn so that  they could figure out a way to go after President Trump. </p><p>It's all part of the same theme. This is anybody with a brain can figure  out that Sally Yates had already decided that they were going to frame  General Flynn. And, you know what? They succeeded. They did. They framed  him.</p><p>CARLSON: So, the - the report we got last night from Mueller's team  suggests that Flynn was cooperating in various other ancillary  investigations.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What might those be?</p><p>DIGENOVA: You know, I saw that little - it's a very short pleading. It was  only like--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DIGENOVA: --six or seven pages. And it had a page that was all dark with  all these ominous things, which allegedly went to the content and the  context of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Is there anything else (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --communications that the--</p><p>CARLSON: there (ph)--</p><p>DIGENOVA: --transition team had. Well, there's no evidence that anything  else that he has cooperated on has anything to do with Russian collusion,  the basic premise for this idiotic investigation that Mueller helped set  up. </p><p>And so, the answer is, I have no idea what he's cooperating on, and it  can't be anything of significance. Otherwise, they would have mentioned it  somewhere in their pleadings.</p><p>CARLSON: So, just to, like take two steps back, I think you know General  Flynn. I know General Flynn.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Yes, I do.</p><p>CARLSON: And here you have a guy who ran a Federal Intelligence Agency, who  was a General in the Armed Services who committed perjury, says Robert  Mueller, and whose life has been completely destroyed. Is that an  overstatement?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It's not an overstatement. And, in fact, that was their goal. </p><p>Their goal was to make it impossible for him not to have his life destroyed  so that it - they could have a skin, so that they could show that somebody  did something wrong, who was communicating with a Russian, even though  those communications with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians and  other foreign officials were perfectly legal. </p><p>Sally Yates made up this Logan Act nonsense, which he was not charged with,  nobody's been charged in a 100 years with violating the Logan Act. Perhaps,  they should look at John Kerry.</p><p>The bottom line is this was a frame-up of General Flynn to get Donald  Trump. And, you know what? It almost worked, except there was no collusion.  Mueller knew it when he was appointed. Rod Rosenstein knew there was  collusion when he appointed him.</p><p>CARLSON: The lesson is never plead, fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Always fight.</p><p>CARLSON: Always fight.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Never give in.</p><p>CARLSON: And don't talk voluntarily, my God.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Take the Fifth.</p><p>CARLSON: Take the--</p><p>DIGENOVA: That's why God made it.</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha. Jim - the Jimmy Hoffa rule. And I, by the way, I'm for  that. Joe diGenova, thank you very much.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Ken Starr was the Independent Counsel, of course, during the  Clinton Administration, and recently wrote the book, Contempt: A Memoir of  the Clinton Investigation. He joins us tonight.</p><p>Mr. Starr, thank you very much for coming on. So--</p><p>KENNETH WINSTON STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE, CONTEMPT AUTHOR: My pleasure, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --to - to Joe diGenova's point, which I - I think sounds right  that nothing we have seen on earth by the Mueller investigation so far, at  least, pertaining to American citizens, relates to Russian collusion. Does  it bother you that the investigation seems to have gone off on a tangent?</p><p>STARR: I don't think it's a tangent. And I've got a different perspective,  not on the collusion point. I completely agree with Joe. There's nothing  about this that smacks of or even suggests collusion with the Russians. </p><p>But just taking the documents that were filed at face value, and Joe may  call them into question, but just taking them for what they say, they say  that General Flynn lied multiple times to different agencies, different  folks in the Justice Department, including about Turkey, his representation  of Turkey, his representation in terms of why did he write an op-ed piece. </p><p>And you can say, \"Who cares about this?\" Well I will say this, \"Don't lie  to the investigators.\" From what I've seen--</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with that.</p><p>STARR: --from what I've seen, there was no perjury trap. He was able to  tell the truth, but for some reason, about issues that he had every reason  to be involved with the Russian Ambassador, issues with respect to  sanctions, the - going forward, what's the relationship going to be with  Russia. </p><p>This is a completely appropriate contact that he had. And so, why he fell  into this pattern, and it's a pattern, apparently. Just, again, I'm taking  what the document says that Mr. Mueller--</p><p>CARLSON: No. Wait, but may--</p><p>STARR: --filed.</p><p>CARLSON: --I stop you there and ask, my understanding is that the  conversation in question with FBI agents that forms the basis of these  charges was a voluntary one at which he did not have a--</p><p>STARR: Correct.</p><p>CARLSON: --lawyer present. Is that correct (ph)? Took place in the White  House and he didn't - I mean, if he understood it was an interview, he  would have had an attorney, correct? But he didn't. So, what does that--</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes it, yes have (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --tell you?</p><p>STARR: --it - it tells you that for whatever reason, if he made a mistake,  if it's an honest mistake, but that's not what he's pled to.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: He's pled to lying. So, whether it's poor judgment on his part, and  it - and it is. It's an American tragedy. His 33 years of service, five  years combat, Defense Intelligence Agency, so this is someone who's had  this exemplary career. </p><p>And I quite agree this is a hugely tragic. But I don't think it works to  simply say, \"Hey he didn't tell the truth. Who cares?\" And no one said  that. But I think that's the thrust of some of the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --critique that we are hearing that--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I think the - but the--</p><p>STARR: --it's OK be--</p><p>CARLSON: --the broader question and I think this--</p><p>STARR: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --this arose during the investigation--</p><p>STARR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --that you presided over is at what cost to the country. I mean  OK. But I mean--</p><p>STARR: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --if you, so you empower this guy who basically in real life has  no oversight. Let's not pretend. He doesn't have any oversight. And you  empower him in order to uncover the Russian plot. And then he winds up  threatening people with prison for things that have nothing to do with the  Russian plot, so like how do we benefit from that exactly?</p><p>STARR: And that's a very fair question. The whole Special Counsel  apparatus, the Independent Counsel apparatus, those are fair questions.  Let's talk about those kinds of questions.</p><p>Now, the check that was on me, as Independent Counsel, was, I didn't simply  say, \"Let's go investigate Monica Lewinsky.\" The Attorney General of the  United States made that determination. And I think--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STARR: --that's lost on the American people. And so too here--</p><p>CARLSON: I think that's probably true.</p><p>STARR: --yes. And so too here, there are checks you may say, \"Well how much  of a check has it been?\" But right now, the person who is in charge of this  investigation, not day-to-day, is Matt Whitaker, the acting Attorney  General, under the regulations.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STARR: So, let's see. Let's - let's see what unfolds in the coming days.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't think he'll be (ph). Very quickly, Mr. Starr, you knew  President George H.W. Bush for an - an awful long time, 50 years.</p><p>STARR: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What was your - what was your feeling about the service today?</p><p>STARR: Oh, it was an absolutely gorgeous outpouring. I loved, among other  things, Senator Alan Simpson talking about the road in Washington D.C. of  humility. It's not very crowded. But that's the road that George Herbert  Walker Bush walked on. </p><p>I was overruled by him, by the way, as President of the United States, when  I was serving as Solicitor General. And, you know what? He was very wise  and overruling me. He was right. I wasn't. He was a great man.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, a footnote to history. Ken Starr, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STARR: Hey, thank you, Tucker. My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: The State of California was once the richest state. Today, it's  the poorest state, by far. Why is that? There is a reason. And we've got it  for you, after the break.</p><p>Plus, one of the best sights and sounds from today's funeral for the 41st  President of the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNA BUSH HAGER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH,  AMERICAN NEWS PERSONALITY, TEACHER, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: A reading from  Revelation--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for more than a century, California represented everything  that was great about America. In 1849, thousands rode wagons across the  entire continent to participate in the Gold Rush. In the early 1900s, film  directors came by the dozens from the East Coast and made Los Angeles the  center of global film production. </p><p>During the Dust Bowl, thousands of Midwestern farmers found refuge in the  Central Valley. And, of course, for decades, California has been home to  the world's greatest technological innovation. </p><p>It's no accident that California became the country's richest state. It was  a land of limitless opportunity. Even if you never made millions there, you  could live in what was, in effect, a middle-class paradise. </p><p>That's not true anymore. According to the census, almost a fifth of  Californians now live in poverty. That's the highest percentage in the  country. California's middle-class is fleeing to Phoenix and Reno and  Boise. Soon, the state will be comprised almost entirely of rich and poor. </p><p>How did this happen? That question is rarely asked. The answer is pretty  simple. Low-skilled immigration overwhelmed California. More than a quarter  of the state's entire population, as of today, is foreign-born. Again, the  highest rate in the country.</p><p>Some of these immigrants are building successful new companies in Silicon  Valley, good for them. But most of them are not. In fact, the overwhelming  majority of these immigrants are on welfare. </p><p>Fully 72 percent of non-citizen households in the State of California now  receive aid. That compares to just 35 percent of native-born households,  more than double the rate. Now, a 100 years ago, immigrants came to  California for opportunity. And now, they come for the benefits. Who can  blame them? </p><p>Democrats long ago discovered that welfare is a handy vote-buying scheme.  Free stuff equals political power. So, they give more even as native-born  Californians are forced to flee an increasingly unaffordable state.  Democratic lawmakers, even now, are considering a new bill that would give  state-funded health insurance to adult illegal immigrants. </p><p>That means that literally anybody from anywhere on the globe could hop the  border in Tijuana and get healthcare paid for by California taxpayers.  Pretty generous. If only California cared about its own people this much,  it would still be the Golden State.</p><p>Well, President George H.W. Bush was honored today in a state funeral at  the Washington National Cathedral. It was a moving tribute to the country's  41st President. Here's some of the highlights from it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He was born with  just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather, and  great-grandfather. He was firm in his principles and supportive as we began  to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted, but never steered. We  tested his patience. I know I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUSH: But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love.</p><p>Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy  answered the phone said he - \"I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said  anything for most of the day.\" I said, \"Dad, I love you, and you've been a  wonderful father.\" And the last words he would ever say on earth were, \"I  love you, too.\"</p><p>We're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay  with us forever. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of  knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or  daughter could have.</p><p>And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and  holding Mom's hand again.</p><p>(CROWD APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Wow. </p><p>Tomorrow, a funeral service for President Bush would be held in Houston,  Texas. Bush 41 will then be laid to rest at his Presidential Library on the  campus of the University - Texas A&amp;M University. Stay with Fox News  throughout the day tomorrow for coverage of that.</p><p>So, riots are taking place in Paris and throughout France. They're about  climate change, and they tell you a lot about the attitudes of the people  in charge. We'll investigate that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for decades now, elites have told the rest of us that they  are deeply, deeply concerned about climate change, much more concerned than  we are, because they're deeper and more thoughtful and compassionate  people.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, for example, deeply concerned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNARD SANDERS, POLITICIAN, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, VERMONT: Donald  Trump spoke last night.

And he feels it deeply.</p><p>Over at NBC, by the way, one of their anchors recently wondered if climate  change is so serious that it might render our lives without meaning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATHARINE BEAR TUR, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC LIVE ANCHOR, AUTHOR:  Fires, flood, storms, famine, the effects of climate change are all around  us. And according to a new essay penned by Bill McKibben, it is shrink - it  is shrinking our world. Not livably - not literally, excuse me, but  livably.</p><p>I read that New Yorker article today and I thought \"Gosh, how pointless is  my life, and how pointless is the - are the decisions that I'm making on a  day-to-day basis when we are not focused on climate change every day, when  it's not leading every one of our newscasts?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. In other words, if it's not about climate change it doesn't  really matter. So, let's take this seriously just for a second. Why not?  They're always telling us. Let's take what they say at face value.</p><p>They care deeply about climate change. But if they care as deeply as they  say they do, if they believe the destruction of the planet is as imminent  as they say it is, why are they living the way that they do?</p><p>You just saw the tape of Bernie Sanders. He cares a lot. And yet a (ph)  news story came out today that said he spent $300,000 in a single month  flying on a private plane. Huh? </p><p>How could he do that? How could any of them own second homes, if they  really believe climate change is real? How are they using a car service  when they could use mass transit? Why aren't they all vegans? Why aren't  they living what they say they believe? They're not.</p><p>The solutions they suggest, and this is not unrelated, are almost always  going to be paid for by other people. The most regressive kinds of taxes,  energy taxes, imposed on the masses. Well, as the riots in Paris show, the  masses aren't into this. And why would they be?</p><p>Nomiki Konst is a candidate for New York City Public Advocate, and she  joins us tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on. So--</p><p>NOMIKI KONST, CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC ADVOCATE: Hi, Tucker. How  you're doing?</p><p>CARLSON: I'm great. So, most - but I'm a little bit confused. So, mostly,  debates about climate change or one person saying it's real and the other  one's like--</p><p>KONST: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --ah, we don't really have all the evidence. Granted, I grant  everything you say about climate change. I'm just - just for the sake of  this conversation.</p><p>KONST: Well thank you, that's a start.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, OK--</p><p>KONST: You admit it (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --but if you really believe what you're saying, and if Bernie  Sanders really believes what he's saying, then why is he flying on private  planes? I mean I'm - this is sincere question.</p><p>KONST: So, let's not get distracted from the real issue here, what--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>KONST: --the real issue--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not going to - stop, stop, stop. I'm not going to let you  off that easily. </p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is it not a real issue? If climate change, as Katy Tur just  told us, is really the only--</p><p>KONST: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: --issue that matters, then why aren't we living like it's the only  issue that matters?</p><p>KONST: Because it really comes down--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't understand.</p><p>KONST: --to the industry. If the industry wants to make planes that exist  off of renewable energy rather than - than oil and gas, then we will all be  able to live on this planet. It starts at the industry level, not the  consumer. You know, it's not fair--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So - so the individual--</p><p>KONST: --to put the tax--</p><p>CARLSON: --oh it - it's not--</p><p>KONST: --on the individual.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not fair--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --for someone who's telling us the planet's being destroyed to  live in a way that suggests that he actually believes the planet's being  destroyed. So, I don't - I don't - I honestly I really don't get it. </p><p>So, if you're Al Gore and you say, \"Nothing is more important than climate  change. I'm a better person than you are because I care more than you. By  the way, I have one of the largest houses in Nashville and I fly private,  and I take a suburban to the private Airport, to the FBO,\" why should I be  OK?</p><p>I mean, I'm - sincerely, why don't--</p><p>KONST: Because that is not going to solve--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that OK?</p><p>KONST: --individual choices are not going to solve the disaster that we are  facing. We already have a migration issue.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>KONST: We already have flooding. We already have hurricanes like--</p><p>CARLSON: Why aren't--</p><p>KONST: --that have hit Puerto Rico, have hit - have hit New Orleans, have  hit Florida, and have displaced--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --so many working people. This is an industry change. We have to cap  emissions globally.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on. But hold on, then why are we--</p><p>KONST: And if we don't cap emissions--</p><p>CARLSON: --then why are--</p><p>KONST: --with big industries and policy--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --then those individual choices mean nothing.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well first of all--</p><p>KONST: You have to change the standards.</p><p>CARLSON: --first of all, hold on, first of all, individual choices always  mean something.</p><p>KONST: In a libertarian's-- </p><p>CARLSON: Only it sees (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --fantasy world, sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Not - I'm not - I'm not a libertarian. And I'm not living in a  fantasy world. In real life, individual choices matter or else what's the  point of any of this, OK? So, it does start - well Liberals used to say it  starts with one person. </p><p>I guess they don't anymore because they don't want to be held to their own  standards. But the solutions are always like ordinary working people ought  to pay higher gas taxes--</p><p>KONST: It's not the solution at all.</p><p>CARLSON: --but I get--</p><p>KONST: And, actually, we are against that. Progressives versus the  neoliberals and neocons, progressives understand that this needs to be a  huge policy change. With the place where we are right now, if we increase  the temperature one degree, you and I won't be living in D.C., in New York  anymore. </p><p>CARLSON: OK. But - but hold on - hold on--</p><p>KONST: We will be displaced.</p><p>CARLSON: --but no, no, I want to talk about the--</p><p>KONST: And industries will lose money.</p><p>CARLSON: --public policy. OK--</p><p>KONST: Yes, public policy.</p><p>CARLSON: --I want to talk about the public policy--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --solutions that will flow from the predictions that you're  making. Is there any solution you've ever heard of that doesn't increase  the price of energy?</p><p>KONST: Absolutely (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I've never heard of one.</p><p>KONST: Well, OK. So, if you're going to be focused on the price of energy,  we're not going to have a plan--</p><p>CARLSON: Well because--</p><p>KONST: --in 10 years.</p><p>CARLSON: --well hold on--</p><p>KONST: We have to talk about changing--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait hold on--</p><p>KONST: --but let me finish--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared--</p><p>KONST: --Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought you cared about working people. And with--</p><p>KONST: We're going down a rabbit hole. I want to talk about the solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: We're not.</p><p>KONST: The solution would be a Green New Deal, moving to 100 percent  renewable energy, forcing the companies that are jacking up the prices on  working people--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: --to actually reduce their emissions, so that working people aren't  displaced, so working people--</p><p>CARLSON: But can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --don't have to pay the cost of hurricane damage--</p><p>CARLSON: Can I ask you a question?</p><p>KONST: --and have clean water--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. But--</p><p>KONST: --and the water's not being privatized.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Volume is not the same as an argument, OK? So, just really  simple question, would your solution--</p><p>PARKER: You don't like opinion of women, do you?</p><p>CARLSON: --I live with four of them.</p><p>KONST: Volume.</p><p>CARLSON: You're not going to go, \"You're a sexist now\"--</p><p>KONST: You're pretty loud. My ear piece is--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. OK.</p><p>KONST: --blaring right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me - let me just ask you a really simple question. Would the  solutions that you're espousing now--</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --would they raise the price of gasoline for wage earners, the  ones--</p><p>KONST: Not with the Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: --you claim to care about.</p><p>KONST: I'm actually against--</p><p>CARLSON: It wouldn't. Gas would be the same price.</p><p>KONST: --I am against raising consumer prices. That is a neoliberal design.  I am a Democratic Socialist. I think we should pass policies and actually  make rich people, millionaires and billionaires, and corporations, pay  taxes. That's the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: No one at the top is paying taxes and the--</p><p>CARLSON: But - but you would allow--</p><p>KONST: --burden is going to the consumer.</p><p>CARLSON: --but you would allow private planes to fly, I guess, right? That  wouldn't--</p><p>KONST: I think private planes have an obligation--</p><p>CARLSON: --be a problem for you at all.</p><p>KONST: --to change their standards. That is what policy is all about. If we  didn't regulate water--</p><p>CARLSON: So we get solar private planes.</p><p>KONST: --solar private plane - I mean I don't know how that would function.  But I think that there are other efficient--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't either.</p><p>KONST: --of energy--</p><p>CARLSON: Name one--</p><p>KONST: --energy use.</p><p>CARLSON: --name - really quick, just for fun, name a renewable energy  source that could power--</p><p>KONST: I mean there's--</p><p>CARLSON: --an airplane.</p><p>KONST: --well there's - there's - I mean we see it with cars. We have--</p><p>CARLSON: Hemp? No, I'm - seriously--</p><p>KONST: --you could charge--</p><p>CARLSON: --is there one?</p><p>KONST: --I mean there are - do you - do you know what a Prius is and a  Tesla is? You could do that--</p><p>CARLSON: I know (ph) they could power an airplane--</p><p>KONST: --at the level of private planes as such (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --an electric airplane, a big electric airplane.</p><p>KONST: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>KONST: I mean I am no engineer but I have heard of electric cars--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think--</p><p>KONST: --and airplanes and other forms of electric solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Cool.</p><p>KONST: I mean there's also solar generated so that the electricity that  you're charging with--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's solar plant (ph)--</p><p>KONST: --is solar energy--</p><p>CARLSON: We're back to the solar plant, good I'm--</p><p>KONST: --generated or wind generated.</p><p>CARLSON: --look, I'm - I'd be excited (ph). Text me a picture, if you find  one on the internet. Nomiki, thank you very much.</p><p>KONST: We have to solve this problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>KONST: You can't live in - in another planet.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>Columbia students can't take a joke, it turns out. They're the most  impressive people our society produces but they have no sense of humor that  has kicked a comedian off their campus for telling a very tepid joke.</p><p>Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy tells real jokes and has lived to tell the  tale. How does he do it? He joins us next with his answer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Nimesh Patel works for Saturday Night Live. He is the, in  case you're keeping track, the first Indian-American cast member on that  show. You'd think that would make him a hero to the pro-diversity crowd.  But instead, Patel is a villain tonight. Why?  Well he recently made the mistake of going to Columbia University, where  all the impressive kids go, and did a comedy set briefly before he was  booted off stage. </p><p>He told a joke that began roughly this way. \"Being gay can't be a choice,\"  he said, because, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, this black thing  is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\" </p><p>Now, is that a funny joke? I don't know. Your call. But it's not really  attacking anybody. It hardly seems vicious. But you can't say that in 2018.  So, the question is, what exactly can you say?</p><p>Well Dave Portnoy seems to say exactly whatever he wants to say all the  time. He's the Founder of Barstool Sports. For some reason, it's working  for him, if nobody else. He joins us tonight to tell us how he does that.</p><p>Dave, thanks a lot for joining us. So, am I missing--</p><p>DAVID PORTNOY, BARSTOOL SPORTS FOUNDER, BLOGGER, PODCAST HOST: Thanks for  having me.</p><p>CARLSON: --something. That - that didn't - I didn't think it was a  particularly hilarious joke or maybe there was more to it. He got yelled  offstage before he could finish. But that didn't seem to me to cross any  kind of obvious line, or am I missing the lines, I guess?</p><p>PORTNOY: No. I thought that was a pretty good joke. The name of the event,  by the way, I think, was cultureSHOCK: Reclaim. I mean if you go into a  comedy club and you have shock in there and that offends you, you probably  shouldn't be in the comedy club. </p><p>Very, very odd set of circumstances, to actually being paid, or whatever,  to go to this event and be offended by any sort of joke. And like you said,  that was - that was a nothing joke. I mean I think it's well-written. But  he had to be the most surprised guy in the room.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what's amazing to me is--</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean, really, it's like--</p><p>CARLSON: --this is Columbia, like these are supposed to be the smartest,  most sophisticated young people in America, certainly ones with the highest  SAT scores. What does it tell you that they have literally no sense of  humor?</p><p>PORTNOY: Well, I mean that actually doesn't even (ph) surprise me about the  Ivy Leagues. I don't know where you went, Tucker. You seem like you'd be an  Ivy League guy with a bowtie and all that. But it's a--</p><p>CARLSON: No.</p><p>PORTNOY: --but Ivy League guys, I mean the stuff, you know, sense of humor  that's kind of the stereotype. But then you have the other side of it. I  mean they're certainly like the Harvard Lampoon. They're certainly famous  for pushing boundaries and things like that. I don't know what this club  was.</p><p>The - it was Asian Allegiance of something. Again, you can't name the event  cultureSHOCK, and then, when somebody says a pretty vanilla joke in the  schema (ph) jokes, get upset--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PORTNOY: --very odd, very - he - he just had to be shocked like, \"Whoa,  what did I say?\" He probably didn't even know.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I've asked you this before but I can't get enough of it  because I think it's so interesting. </p><p>You run a site, it's one of the most popular and, I would say, also, one of  the best on the internet, where you seem to say pretty much exactly what  you feel like saying, and all your writers, Francis Ellis, one of my  favorites, on your site have the same attitude, and you continue to do it  without being forced to stop. </p><p>How do you do that? How do you carve out that freedom in a world where  there isn't any freedom?</p><p>PORTNOY: Yes. We built that. Again, we're not a slave to our advertisers.  That's a huge thing. So, we don't get caught in the winds of public opinion  and things like that, and it works for us. </p><p>And to be honest, we've come to now accept in this environment where people  get mad about jokes like that, we're just going to stay true to what we do,  and there is a big market for it. </p><p>And there's always going to be haters. And a lot of times the haters don't  even know what we do. Tucker, I've been called like anti-Semitic, a million  times. I'm Jewish. So, you know, people just don't know what they're--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you--</p><p>PORTNOY: --talking about--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, hold on, wait, what do you say--</p><p>PORTNOY: --but I get that like once a week--</p><p>CARLSON: --when someone says, \"Dave Portnoy, you anti-Semite,\" what - how  do you respond to that?</p><p>PORTNOY: It depends what type of mood. Sometime, I'll be like, \"Yes, you're  right. You nailed it. I'm like a Nazi or something.\" But it's just - and,  again, I'm playing. And people are so crazy, they even (ph) take that out  of context. </p><p>So, you know, we are a comedy site. We're comfortable in what we do. But if  people don't like something, they feel like they're right. They don't want  to hear the other side of the coin. But they'll go out of their way. </p><p>There were pictures of me, Tucker, on this show, and somebody tried to say  somehow that made me like anti-Semite. And it's like, \"Dude, I'm Jewish, so  what are you talking about?\" </p><p>People just don't really want to look into the context or what's going on.  And we've embraced it. And there is a big market for it. And - and I think  that makes us more popular in this day and age when people are afraid to  say, \"You know, that joke that that guy got booted off stage for, that's  ridiculous.\"</p><p>Steve Carell, The Office, my personal favorite comedy, he was on record, I  think, a couple weeks ago, he says, The Office couldn't exist now. Two  people will get mad.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PORTNOY: I mean that's a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true.</p><p>PORTNOY: That's a true shame.</p><p>CARLSON: But you tell the truth and you're winning anyway. That's why  you're an inspiration to the rest of us. Dave Portnoy, El Presidente, great  to see you.</p><p>PORTNOY: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: One Democratic lawmaker says she has cracked the code that  explains why Democrats aren't winning more seats in the Congress. We'll  tell you what she's discovered, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well Democrats retook the House in November's elections. But they  lost seats in the Senate. And the Blue Wave wasn't quite as big as they  hoped it would be. Why did that happen?</p><p>Well, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii says she knows why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAZIE KEIKO HIRONO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, HAWAII, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  MEMBER: One of the things that we, Democrats, have a really hard time is  connecting to people's hearts instead of here.</p><p>We have a really hard time doing that. And one of the reasons that - that  was told to me at one of our retreats was that we, Democrats, know so much.  That is true. And we have to kind of tell everybody how smart we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We're just too smart. We care too much. We're too erudite. We  believe in science, except biology and ultrasounds. We're just too good.  America doesn't deserve us. </p><p>This is the person who said she knew Kavanaugh was guilty of rape because  he was a man. Just too smart. Amazing! What a world?</p><p>That's the end of our hour. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 P.M., the show  that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. </p><p>Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity, live from New York.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: All right. I'm not that smart, just saying.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not--</p><p>HANNITY: I'm not - I'm not making that claim.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm not that of (ph) that smart either, oh my God.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

And at the end of that period, we have  discovered there is still no evidence at all of collusion between the  Donald Trump for President campaign of 2016 and the Russian government.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Mueller's many supporters in Washington don't seem to care about that.   That's because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously.  The  whole absurd fever dream was always a way for the ruling class to feel  better about losing power in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It was a way for them to avoid thinking about why Trump got elected.  And  they never have thought about it.</p><p> Along the way, the investigation has provided Democrats with a full year of  government-funded oppo research and destroyed the lives of a number of  people who supported Donald Trump.  There are added bonuses from the  Democratic perspective.</p><p> But there have been downsides for Democrats.  Voters are not impressed by  the Russia story.  It is weird and false and confusing.  It has precisely  nothing to do with voters' actual lives or the issues they vote on.  It is  a total waste of time for everyone.</p><p> And yet, it's all Democrats have.  Trump is evil, so is Russia.  That's the  entire progressive program of 2018 summarized in two sentences.  If the  Democratic Party had a Sermon on the Mount, those would be the attitudes.   No wonder their approval numbers are falling.</p><p> Republican Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana has introduced a resolution  calling for an end to Mueller's investigation or a report within 30 days.   He joins us along with fellow Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida.  He says  he may know the identity of the person who was spied on Trump's campaign  for the FBI in 2016.</p><p> Gentlemen, welcome to you both tonight.  Congressman Rokita, first to you,  so this resolution would call for an end to the investigation or a report  summarizing its findings so far.  Am I misstating that?</p><p> REP. TODD ROKITA (R), INDIANA:  No.  Both correct, Tucker.  The fact of the  matter is it's been a year.  As you say, it's been $20 million and we need  to see a report of what evidence he has.  And absent that evidence, it  should wind up within 30 days of the resolution passing.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, why wouldn't other members on both sides in the Congress want  some oversight?  You are constitutionally bound to provide oversight of the  DOJ.  So, why are you the only person calling for this?</p><p> ROKITA:  Well, I'm not.  Matt Gaetz is also calling for it.  There's a  couple other calling for it, but we need your viewers to call your members  of Congress and get them on board.  You can only have a free republic, as  you know, Tucker, if you have transparency.  And this is exactly what we  need.</p><p> It is a witch hunt.  It has gone beyond an investigation.  And the only  evidence of collusion that we found, the only evidence of criminality has  been on the Democrats.</p><p> So, we're calling on Mueller to show his hand or fold the deck.</p><p> CARLSON:  Even if I believed the president colluded with Vladimir Putin,  I'd be very concerned about this investigation because the parameters  aren't clear.  The timeline is opaque.  And it's not clear what the point  is.</p><p> So, Congressman DeSantis, one of the enduring mysteries of the past two  weeks has been the story of a mole or a spy within the Trump campaign  feeding information to the Russia investigation.</p><p> Have you any sense who that person might be?</p><p> REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Look, I do, Tucker.  But I think that the  issue needs to go through the proper channels.  I'm not comfortable  disclosing who I think it is based on the evidence that I have.</p><p> But I can say this, the American people deserve an answer.  Up or down, did  the FBI direct somebody to spy on Donald Trump's campaign?  Was somebody  actively working to undermine his campaign and create the illusion of  collusion?</p><p> And if that's the case, I think that's more serious than the FISA abuse.  I  think it's more serious than Rosenstein butchering this whole appointing  order with Mueller from the beginning.</p><p> So, we need the answer to those questions.  They are not giving us the  answers right now, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are definitely not.  Now, I know you don't want to risk  libel by naming someone because this has not been proved in court, but give  us a sense of what you are talking about.  Are you saying that someone who  worked on the Trump campaign fed information to law enforcement?</p><p> DESANTIS:  So, if you look at Glenn Simpson's testimony from Fusion GPS, he  talked about there being a human source.  And that was something that was  controversial.  Some people said it was Papadopoulos.  That's not what he  was referring to.  </p><p> So, the issue is he acknowledges there's a human source.  Peter Strzok, he  opens up the counterintelligence investigation in the summer of 2016, what  does he do the next day?  He goes to Great Britain, he goes to London and  he's meeting with people.</p><p> Well, how the heck would you do that if you just opened the investigation  that day?  So, I think in that kind of - the London, Christopher Steele,  Glenn Simpson axis is probably the individual that we're looking at.</p><p> But, I mean, look, we need to know whether this individual was spying or  not.  I have great concerns about it, but I think we can get those  questions' answer when the Justice Department ponies up the documents.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, last - you're absolutely right.  The last follow-up on that,  are you suggesting or do you believe that this is someone who was pressured  into cooperating with the investigation or someone who freely sent  information over about the campaign?</p><p> DESANTIS:  I think it's the latter, Tucker.  I think this would be somebody  - potentially could have been paid by the FBI, like Steele.  There was an  agreement to pay Steele.</p><p> We just need an answer to that?  Did they pay anybody?  Yes or no.  Did  they direct anyone to go to the campaign?  Yes or no.  Very easy questions  to answer.</p><p> ROKITA:  And, Tucker, we need the -</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  I'm sorry, congressman.  Please go ahead.</p><p> ROKITA:  Yes.  Ron DeSantis is exactly right.  We also need to know the  relationship between Mueller and Comey.  Comey kicked this whole thing off  with a bogus FISA warrant.  And what is the relationship between Mueller  and Comey?  Did Mueller give Comey immunity?  Does Comey think he's about  the law?  Where are we going with all this?  That what needs to be  investigated.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do believe - quickly, congressman, do you believe that Jim Comey  has been offered immunity by the Mueller investigation?</p><p> ROKITA:  I think it stands to reason.  And I think the American people  deserve to know.</p><p> CARLSON:  That would be shocking.  Congressmen, thank you both.  I  appreciate that.  And I hope you get to the bottom of those.  We have a  right to know.</p><p> ROKITA:  Thanks.</p><p> DESANTIS:  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Ted Malloch was an informal advisor to the Donald Trump campaign.   In March, he says he was detained at an airport by investigators for Robert  Mueller who took away his cell phone and asked about his ties to Roger  Stone, among other things.  He is also the author of the book, \"The Plot to  Destroy Trump:  How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to  Subvert the President\".  </p><p> Ted Malloch joins us tonight.  Ted, thank you for coming on.</p><p> TED MALLOCH, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Good evening.</p><p> CARLSON:  When you say you were detained, that's kind of a remarkable  story.  Tell us the circumstances of this.</p><p> MALLOCH:  Especially for a Yale, Oxford and a business school professor to  be stopped at an airport, taken into a room and asked questions by the FBI  and having their phone then under a warrant seized.</p><p> But I write about this in the book as a postscript and my lawyers tell me  not to confirm or deny very much about this because I'm still actively  participating in this conversation.</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't understand.  Why would that put you in legal peril if you  believe the government overstepped and detained you - this is at Logan  Airport in Boston, right?  You're flying in from abroad.  They pull you  aside, take your cell phone and ask you questions.  You have no lawyer  present, is that correct, during this conversation?</p><p> MALLOCH:  None at all.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  So, how - why would you be in jeopardy by exercising your  First Amendment right to explain the truth?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I have explained it as a postscript to the book and actually  detailed it.  And I'm told that the FBI is not all that happy about that  fact.  So, therefore, I'm not really at liberty to say a whole lot more  about where this stands at present.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  Give us a sense, though.  When you sat down, you had no  lawyer.  It's generally not advised to talk to the FBI without a lawyer.   Did they just grab you as you got off the plane?  And what did you say to  them when they did?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, they had me wait for about 20 minutes, as I say, and then  divided me from my wife and then searched my belongings and took me to a  separate building to introduce me to two FBI agents who asked me a series  of questions.</p><p> Actually, it was quite chit chatty for about 20 minutes.  As a fan of the  Philadelphia Eagles, they asked me what I thought of their victory at the  Super Bowl.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's what they said to Mike Flynn too during his chit chatty  conversation, I'm sure.  </p><p> So, they had a warrant for all of this, I assume.  Is that right?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Correct.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  What did they ask you?</p><p> MALLOCH:  As I said in the postscript, there were very few substantive  questions.  Some about individuals, what my relationship was to the  campaign.  They seem to know all the answers to the questions.</p><p> CARLSON:  Did you consider saying buzz off, I'm not going to answer your  questions?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I think had they gotten any more aggressive, then, in fact, that  would have been the case, but they were fairly benign.  I'm a patriotic  American.  A cold warrior.  I worked in the State Department.  I was the  top American in the UN in Geneva, Switzerland for four years at the end of  the Cold War.</p><p> I'm certainly willing to cooperate in any inquiry.  I don't think I have  much to add.</p><p> CARLSON:  Why do you think they wanted to talk to you?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, my publisher thinks they had pre-read my book on the plot  to destroy the president, which is, in fact, about the conspiracy - the  first in American history since 1783 and the Newburgh conspiracy that tried  to overthrow a sitting president of the United States.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why did they ask you about Roger Stone?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I have no idea.  I've met Roger Stone three times.  He did write  the foreword to my new book because we had the same publisher.  He gave an  address at Oxford University about 8 or 10 weeks ago and it was a pretty  compelling story about what happened in the 2016 election and we had it  transcribed.  I had attended that lecture.  And we used it as the foreword  to the book.  So, maybe they read more into that than is the case.</p><p> CARLSON:  What did they do to your phone?  You said they had a warrant for  your phone?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Yes.  They confiscated my phone and I'm told it's been returned  to me and I should be receiving it any day.</p><p> CARLSON:  They took your phone away?  How long have they had it?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, since that day, which was before Easter.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'd be pretty annoyed.  Ted, thank you for joining us.  I  appreciate it.</p><p> MALLOCH:  Good to be with you, Tucker.  Thanks.</p><p> CARLSON:  Democratic congressional candidate has expressed his real  thoughts about the NRA in a new ad, which is completely over-the-top.  He  joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a politician's job is to appeal to voters.  Left-leaning  voters don't like the NRA.  Pat Davis is a Democrat running for Congress in  New Mexico.  Put two and two together and Davis has produced a new ad where  he expresses his view of the NRA unambiguously, but you decide.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAT DAVIS (D), NEW MEXICO CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the  NRA.  Their program policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers  and dead fathers.  I'm Pat Davis and I approve this message because if  Congress won't change our gun laws, we are changing Congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Pat Davis joins us tonight from New Mexico.  Pat, thanks for  coming on.</p><p> DAVIS:  Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, that's the ad?  Eff the NRA?  Kind of moronic, no?</p><p> DAVIS:  That's it, just 15 seconds, but it got a whole lot of attention and  started a new conversation about guns and I'm grateful for that.</p><p> CARLSON:  But doesn't it degrade you?  You use the F word in an ad.  I  mean, if you have a position, state it, but F the NRA?  I mean, come on.</p><p> DAVIS:  Well, Tucker, being polite, it hasn't made our schools any safer,  it hasn't protected police officers like I used to be.  If a cuss word on  TV offends you more than pictures of dead children in Parkland or Newtown,  then your priorities are all wrong.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's not either/or.  I don't care if you were a cop or not.  Hold  on.  Wait.  Let me ask you a question.  It's not an either/or.  It's not  that I'm so offended.  Politeness doesn't work, do you think rudeness will?   Is rudeness going to save lives, do you think?</p><p> DAVIS:  As we were looking to make this ad, we kept coming up with the same  idea.  And every ad idea we came up to talk about this issue looked like  somebody else's.  And those had not worked.</p><p> Clearly, this got the NRA's attention and it has started a new conversation  both amongst candidates running for office, about how we organize and take  back Congress and put new leaders there to take on control, but also how we  stand up to the NRA.</p><p> We know what works.  Fifty percent of NRA members support - </p><p> CARLSON:  No, it started a conversation about how embarrassing you are.   How many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p> DAVIS:  Well - but, Tucker, here's the thing.  A majority of Americans - 89  percent of police officers, a majority of NRA members know there are common  sense things we can do.</p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  Slow down.  You just released an ad that said F the  NRA, which I'm sure back at your fraternity house they love.  But let me  ask you an adult question, how many NRA members have committed mass  shootings?</p><p> DAVIS:  Tucker, this is about the organization itself.  My family grew up,  when I was growing up - </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm asking you about the organization itself.</p><p> DAVIS:  It's not the NRA of my dad's organization.</p><p> CARLSON:  F the NRA.  But how many of their members - hold on.  They have  millions of members.  How many of them - </p><p> DAVIS:  They do.  And I've been hearing from them all week.  I've been  hearing from them all week because the NRA made us their target.</p><p> We've started a new conversation and what I've also heard from are parents  in Parkland, in Virginia, in Newtown who donated to keep the ad on the air  because they want people in Congress to finally step up.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  So, you're really doing a public service.</p><p> DAVIS:  If the NRA wants to come to the table and help us pass common sense  regulations that their members support, let's do it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Come to the table?  You just said F the NRA.</p><p> DAVIS:  We are not waiting on them to come to the table.</p><p> CARLSON:  You're really trying to have an adult conversation.  So, here is  your new spot.  And I want to talk to policy and see what you know about  it.  So, here's your latest 15-second ad.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVIS:  By the time this ad is done, an AR-15 could have fired 150 bullets.   That's why we need to ban assault weapons.  I'm Pat Davis, running for  Congress.  And I approve this message because lives are more important than  gun company profits.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just said that in 15 seconds an AR-15 can fire 150  rounds.  Is that true?</p><p> DAVIS:  That's right.  You get it right here in New Mexico.  Right here in  New Mexico, you can go to a parking lot or go on the Internet, buy an  assault weapon, an AR-15 and buy a legally available add-on like a bump  stock that allows you to replicate exactly what happened in Las Vegas.</p><p> The Las Vegas shooter could shoot 600 rounds a minute.</p><p> CARLSON:  You are saying an AR-15 can shoot 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  So,  would it have a 150-round magazine?  What would that - let me ask - let's  be specific about your ad.  What would that magazine look like, the 150- round magazine?</p><p> DAVIS:  Exactly like the magazines the Las Vegas police officers pulled out  of that hotel room.  They had 50 and 100-round magazines and that weapon  was capable -</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you could fire - it is physically possible to fire - it's  not.  I mean, these are rhetorical questions.  You don't know what you're  talking about.  I know that you are a police officer.  Or you claim to have  been.</p><p> DAVIS:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  No AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  That's untrue.  And  if you believe it is true, then you are not qualified to have a  conversation about guns.  People are laughing at you because you are  ignorant.  You don't know what you're talking about.  No, no, that's just  untrue.</p><p> DAVIS:  We take exactly the word of the police officers in Las Vegas who I  trust who ran into that room to save people down below and found a weapon  that was modified with bump stocks.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, so they say an AR-15 - what do you think would happen to the  barrel in 15 seconds if you put 150 rounds?  It would melt.</p><p> DAVIS:  I know they get hot.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, my point is if you're going to take on the NRA and be Mr.  Tough, I was a cop guy, maybe you should know what you're talking about,  but you don't.</p><p> You are putting something on television that's demonstrably wrong, that's  physically possible, and all of your voters are like, oh, yes, this guy  knows what he's talking about, he was a cop, but you don't know.  So, maybe  you should apologize for it.</p><p> DAVIS:  I'm not apologizing for taking on the NRA.  I know why I'm pursuing  it.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm sorry.  Politeness doesn't work.  I'm just trying to - oh,  OK.</p><p> I think you should apologize for saying something that's factually untrue.</p><p> DAVIS:  Apologies and politeness have not changed the conversation.  We  need new focus to take over and decide.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, that's why I'm not being polite.  I'm trying to get a real  conversation going here.  But you don't know what you're talking about, so  maybe you shouldn't be in a position to make decisions because you don't  understand the issue because you just told me with a straight face that an  AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  Oh, surprise.  It can't.</p><p> So, maybe you should admit that and move on to something you understand.   Would you do that?</p><p> DAVIS:  This is exactly the type of arguments that don't get us where we  need to be.  We need new leadership in Congress.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, it's not like, F the NRA.  That's the kind of argument we  need.  I thought politeness didn't work, tough guy?</p><p> DAVIS:  Politeness is not working so far.  If you woke up on Mother's Day  and you don't have your kid anymore -</p><p> CARLSON:  You know what works actually?  Facts work.  Why don't you get  some facts?  Oh, Pat, do you like this new mode of communication we have?   F the NRA, Pat.</p><p> DAVIS:  It would be great to have a conversation.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Learn something about funs and get back to me.  Interview over.   Yes, because you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p> Let's go back to politeness.  I like it better.  It's another primary night  and a Democrat who sounds like Donald Trump could be a winner tonight.   Amazing! He will join us.</p><p> Plus, Brit Hume joins us to break down the Democrats' 2018 message or lack  thereof.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  This is a Fox News alert.  Primary elections held tonight in the  State of Pennsylvania, polling places just closed.  A court there has  radically reshaped the state's congressional boundaries.</p><p> John Morganelli is a Democrat running for Congress in the newly reshaped  7th district in the state's northeast.  The district only narrowly  supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p> And despite his party affiliation, Morganelli is anti-abortion and has  called for some restrictions on immigration and sanctuary cities.  Mr.  Morganelli joins us tonight.  Mr. Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p> JOHN MORGANELLI, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Tucker, thanks for  having me tonight.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, as I understand, there are three candidates, Democratic  candidates, running in this primary tonight.  Polls have closed.  So, we  are not affecting anything with his interview.</p><p> But the three candidates each come from a different strain of the  Democratic Party ideologically.  Describe the kind of Democrat that you  are.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Well, Tucker, I've come out of a blue-collar background.  My  father was a construction worker with a sixth-grade education.  My mother  was a seamstress with 11th grade education.</p><p> And I believe that I've come out of the sort of the traditional Democratic  Party that's concerned about working men and women, that's concerned about  the blue-collar issues that affect these folks and I have always believed  the John F.  Kennedy model and, even to some degree, the Bill Clinton  model, who ran as a centrist.  And that's pretty much where I have been.   I'm not the strain of Democratic Party.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I'm fascinated by the news coverage of your race.  So, you've  said things that don't seem very controversial, like you are not in favor  of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.  You are not against all  immigration, but you're worried about illegal immigration.  And you're not  for giving state-subsidized tuition to illegal immigrants.</p><p> For this, you are described as a hard-liner on immigration.  Do you think  that's fair?  Do you think the coverage of that subject is fair?</p><p> MORGANELLI:  No, I don't think it's fair.  First of all, I'm a grandson of  an Italian immigrant and I believe immigration is great.  It's made our  country great.</p><p> But immigration is a process.  There is laws that we have and people have  to get in line and come into the country in a legal way.  And to describe  me as a hard-liner, I think, is not accurate.  </p><p> I go to the naturalization service that we have in our county where people  from all over the world become naturalized citizens.  It's a wonderful  ceremony in the courthouse.  And those are immigrants.</p><p> What I'm opposed to is just people breaking into our country without  permission.  Some of them being criminals, and I've seen them in my own  county from the MS-13 gang and others.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  And then, our country giving incentives for more illegal  immigration such as driver's license and state tuition, I don't think those  incentives should be given.  It just creates more illegal immigration.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, Bill Clinton said that exact same thing 20 years ago.  Now,  you are one of only a couple Democrats willing to say that out loud.  What  happened to the Democratic Party?</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Well, it's interesting.  As you know, there is a picture - a  video of President Clinton giving, I think, a State of the Union speech  where he talks hard-line on immigration.  He says everything that I believe  in.  And even President Obama gave a similar speech.  So, this is not out  of step with Democrats.</p><p> I mean, in my own community here, I have great support for this position.   People here, Democratic voters, I don't think - I guess we'll know better  tonight - want foreign criminals coming into the county and setting up  shop.</p><p> They don't want sanctuary cities.  I have opposed sanctuary cities for a  long, long time.  Having a sanctuary city is like putting up a big sign  that says, please, all foreign criminals, come here because we won't do  anything about it if you commit a crime.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  So, I don't think that all Democrats are in lockstep  necessarily with some of the national philosophy that comes out of  Washington on this issue.</p><p> CARLSON:  Man, I hope you are right.  And the polls have closed, so I can  say that I'm certainly rooting for you tonight.  John Morganelli, thanks a  lot for coming on.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Thank you.  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Probably won't help.  Well, with some candidates on the  Democratic side flipping the bird to the NRA, while others back Trump-style  immigration, it's not quite clear what the Democratic message is for 2018.</p><p> Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst.  He watches carefully.  He  joins us tonight.  Brit, what do you think the message is?  Or is there a  national message that the Democratic Party is selling this midterm?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it's pretty  indistinct at this moment, if there is one, Tucker.  I think that much of  the party is so mesmerized by Donald Trump and loathes him so deeply that  that has become kind of the central thing and the central theme that you  can see with the Democratic - that's what the Democratic Party appears to  be mostly about right now.  I suspect, as time goes on, something more  oriented towards voters will come along.</p><p> But, remember, Tucker, these candidates are running in a party where 71  percent, according to one recent poll, want Donald Trump impeached.  So,  it's kind of understandable that there would be some focus on him.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  For sure.  Most Democrats are, of course, very anti-Trump.   That's why they are Democrats.  But is that a message that moves people to  the polls?</p><p> HUME:  Well, based on the evidence we have, it seems not to be working very  well.  And the reason I say that is, look at the advantages that Democrats  enjoy going into this midterm election.</p><p> First of all, the political gravity in any president's first midterm is  always with the other party and the average loss is more than would be  enough - if they made their average again, the Democrats would get control  of the House.</p><p> Now, they had a huge gap in what's called the generic ballot.  You know,  Tucker, that's the one where you ask people if they'd rather vote for a  Democrat or Republican unnamed in the upcoming election.</p><p> Normally, Democrats do well on that ballot.  They were up plus 15 or 16 at  one point not very long ago.  And now, that number is down to single  digits.  And some polls down to low single digits which suggest that  whatever they are selling, people are not buying with the enthusiasm that  the party had hoped for.</p><p> CARLSON:  What will happen if they don't retake the House?</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think there will be an agonizing reappraisal because we've  been hearing about this blue wave that was thought to be inevitable, and  may yet come.</p><p> If it doesn't come, obviously, there's going to be a search for scapegoats.   And we will see what happens.</p><p> But this party, I think, Tucker, what we're seeing emerge now is that for  all the divisions in the Republican Party between Trump supporters and the  never Trumpers and so on and all the divisions within the conservative  movement over that, the divisions in the Democratic Party are at least as  deep, if not deeper.  </p><p> And at the heart of the Democratic Party - I remember you saying in a  speech not too many years ago - was not with Hillary Clinton, but she won  anyway.</p><p> A candidate of her stripe, I don't think, could win this time.  I don't  know that a white male candidate could win.</p><p> So, here we are, the Democrats really have some serious divisions to worry  about.  And whether whatever they come up with will be appealing to a broad  cross section of voters is, obviously, what remains to be seen.</p><p> CARLSON:  A white male candidate could not win.  I don't think a lot of the  white male candidates running for the Democratic nomination know that yet,  but I think they're going to learn.</p><p> And do you think that it moves in the direction of populist economics,  become the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders party?</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think that's the drift.  And I think that excites a lot of  people.  And, of course, if you look at the attitudes of young voters now,  who do not seem to have grasped the benefits of a market capitalist economy  and don't seem to be put off at all about the idea of socialism despite  socialism's abysmal history, which is playing out even today in certain  parts of the world, Venezuela being the most conspicuous example, but I  think the party - it's gotten pretty far left now.  And a lot of old ideas  that are being passed off as kind of new ideas are in the air.</p><p> And the party will have to reckon with that because if they come up with  somebody who is an out and out socialist for president, I don't think they  could possibly win.  And I'm not sure how many of them we'll see, but there  will be awful battles over this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Their corporate donors, because the party is entirely supported  by corporate America, are going to pretty surprised when it turns out  they're sending money to Hugo Chavez.</p><p> Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p> HUME:  Yes.  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p> HUME:  No, I was just going to say don't underestimate the ability of a  leftist candidate to raise money from small donations and make a serious  run for it.  Bernie Sanders certainly did.</p><p> CARLSON:  No, that's right.  I just think that Goldman Sachs guys are going  to be pretty shocked when they see what's coming.  Great to see you.</p><p> HUME:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, an embattled minority group is under attack in South Africa  and on the receiving end of genocidal rhetoric.  It is considered  unacceptable to talk about this in the media in the West for some reason,  but we don't care because it's true and it's happening and it's news and we  are covering it.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, now to a fascinating and significant story the media have  all but ignored.  South Africa is a diverse country, but the South African  government would like to make it much less diverse.</p><p> An embattled minority of farmers, mostly Afrikaans speaking, is being  targeted in a wave of barbaric and horrifying murders.</p><p> But instead of protecting them, the government just passed a law allowing  it to seize their farms without any compensation based purely on their  ethnicity and distribute those farms to more favored groups.</p><p> Thousands have already migrated out of the country, but they've struggled  to attract any sympathy abroad for some reason.</p><p> Ernst Roets is deputy CEO of AfriForum.  It's a South Africa civil rights  group.  He was just in the United States to meet with a number of  government officials.  He also took a moment to talk to us.  Here's part of  what he said.</p><p> Ernst Roets joins us now.  Mr. Roets, thanks for coming on.</p><p> ERNST ROETS, SOUTH AFRICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Thank you very much.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you describe in this book a disorganized, but in some sense  intentional campaign to crush a racial minority within your country and the  government seems onboard with it.  Is that an overstatement?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, what the book is about is it's about government complicity in  the scourge of farm attacks and farm murders that we've seen in South  Africa.</p><p> So, in only the last two decades, there's been - according to government  statistics, which we believe - we have reason to say that it's maybe  downplayed a little.  There's been about two farm attacks every day and two  farm murders every week in South Africa.</p><p> And in the book, I highlight actually ten different reasons why we believe  the South African government is complicit.  And it stretches from reasons  including - the fact that as these attacks have worsened - for example, in  2007, there was a 25 percent increase in these attacks and then the South  African government responded saying we're not going to release any more  statistics about this.</p><p> Then also, which is very concerning, is the hate speech in South Africa.   That's the title of the book as well, \"Kill the Boer\", which is a very  popular song which is still being sung in South Africa.  It was sung just  the other day.  So, it's sung at political rallies.</p><p> And, of course, Boer referring to a particular cultural group in South  Africa.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> ROETS:  We have songs like \"Shoot the Boer\", which is a different song.   There are a variety of ways in which - </p><p> CARLSON:  But I thought that hate speech was now a crime punishable by  prison time in South Africa.  Are any of the people who say this arrested?</p><p> ROETS:  There's a bill on the table to have hate speech declared a crime  punishable by prison time.  But if you look at the motivation around it,  it's very clear that - I think those in government who are pushing this  don't regard this as hate speech.</p><p> As a matter of fact, they've been arguing that it's not hate speech in  court.  So, they would argue that they have a right to sing about killing  farmers and then they would say it's an expression of freedom of speech.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, now the government has announced that it plans to pursue a  policy of taking land away from people on the basis of their skin color.   Do you think they'll do that?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, that's what was adopted in our parliament in February.  A  motion was adopted that the property rights clause in the South African  constitution has to be changed to allow for expropriation of private  property without compensation.</p><p> So, the state president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that this would turn South  Africa into the ultimate paradise and the Garden of Eden and Deputy  President David Mabuza even went further saying that - basically  threatening white farmers that if they do not voluntarily hand over their  land to black people, then there would be a violent takeover.  So, the  situation is very dire in South Africa.</p><p> But the good news is that there is still a process that has to be followed  and that's why we are in the United States.</p><p> CARLSON:  What I find so striking is the response from everyone else around  the world.  It's almost never covered in the American media.  There is a  sense that the people being murdered deserve it because of what their  ancestors did.  And the international community is similarly silent.</p><p> Have you met with any government officials here in Washington about what's  happening in your country?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, that's why we are here.  We are about to meet with some  government officials and it's very unfortunate, the situation that you've  just mentioned.</p><p> Especially in South Africa, there's a hierarchy of recognition.  So, some  people, when they are the victims, it's all over the news and you hear  about it frequently.  And other people, especially farmers in South Africa,  white farmers in particular, they would be tortured to death and it would  receive very little news coverage.</p><p> And that's unfortunately the situation abroad as well, which is why we are  very grateful to be having this.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, a government official in Australia said publicly maybe we  ought to allow asylum to people being persecuted for their skin color in  your country and he was basically laughed at and then attacked by your  government for saying that.</p><p> ROETS:  Yes, he was attacked.  And they then said that he shouldn't say  that because AfriForum was providing them with false information.  Well,  the information that we're quoting is government statistics.</p><p> So, that is the situation.  Whoever speaks out against this - we, just for  being in the United States, we've been accused of treason, we've had people  threatening us, saying they will wait for us at the airport when we come  back and they'll attack us and so forth.  We had the state president today  in parliament calling on us to go back to South Africa.</p><p> So, whenever you speak out against this, there is a very serious backlash.</p><p> CARLSON:  This is not what Nelson Mandela wanted.</p><p> ROETS:  No, it's the exact opposite than what he wanted.  He spoke about a  free country in which people were not judged by the color of their skin.   And he even wanted farm attacks to be a priority crime.</p><p> He said that when he was president.  And when his presidency was over, they  deprioritized it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just watch something like this happen in a neighboring  country, Zimbabwe, which went from being one of the richest in Africa to  the poorest in the world because of farm attacks and because of the theft  of private property, is the ANC, the ruling party in South Africa, aware of  that lesson?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, they are, but you know that saying real communism has never  been tried.  That's what they keep saying.  So, it failed in Zimbabwe.  It  failed in Cuba.  It failed in Venezuela.  It failed in Russia.  It failed  in China.  All of those countries.</p><p> And they are basically saying that we're going to try the same thing, but  this time it's going to work.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, last question.  It's considered basically immoral in the  United States to talk to you or to hear stories like this for reasons that  nobody ever bothers really to explain, but it's just understood.</p><p> If you could speak to our media, to the people who are dismissing your  claims as false, what would you say?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, I think there are three things.  Firstly, everything we say  is fact based.  It's based on research.  But in terms of what we hope to  achieve and what people can do, people who want to invest in South Africa,  we want them to call on the South African government to say, listen, you  are calling on us to invest in your country, but you want to expropriate  those investments.</p><p> Number two, we are speaking with the US government and asking them to put  pressure on the South African government, which could be done in a variety  of ways.</p><p> And number three, members of the public and members of the media, the best  thing that you can do to help us is to talk about this, to talk about it on  public platforms and in that way to continue to put pressure on the South  African government not to continue with this policy.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Just to tell the truth.  I agree.  Mr. Roets, thank you.</p><p> ROETS:  Thanks very much.  Thank you for being here.</p><p> CARLSON:  Tech companies are getting more powerful, even as we sleep.   Facebook has a plan for ranking news outlets by how trustworthy it says  they are, while Twitter plans to just censor certain views entirely.  A  brave new world has arrived.  Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to fund  terrorists in Somalia.  That's according to a new report by a Fox affiliate  in the twin cities.</p><p> According to that story, many members of Minnesota's Somali immigrant  community have discovered they can open sham day care centers that only  pretend to watch children, collect a fat subsidy from the state for doing  that and keep the change.  They have made millions of dollars, up to 100  million according to that report.  That would be half of Minnesota's annual  budget for child care assistance.</p><p> Again, these are people who are resettled here as an act of charity by our  country, accused now of defrauding our country.  And not just fraud, fraud  so brazen, the report says, that Somalis buy shares in fake day care  outlets to get a cut of it.</p><p> Some of this fraudulently obtained money is reportedly being shipped back  to Somalia in suitcases full of cash to evade federal wire transfer  restrictions.</p><p> Some of this money is ending up in regions of Somalia controlled by the  Islamic terror group, Al-Shabab.</p><p> Well, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is outraged by the  story.  It's not the fraud that makes him mad or the ingratitude or the  injustice.  It was that it was exposed at all.  That offended him.</p><p> In a statement, he denounced the new report on the grounds that it could  hinder further cash transfers to Somalia, which apparently he cares more  about than America, which he's supposed be representing.</p><p> According to Congressman Ellison, briefcases of untraceable cash in Somalia  hurt Al-Shabab rather than helping them somehow.</p><p> Well, apparently, it's not enough for the tech companies to know what you  do, and they do know what you do, increasingly they want to control what  you do and what you see and what you think.</p><p> During a recent meeting with investors, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  revealed that his company has been ranking news outlets by how trustworthy  they are, with less trusted outlets being penalized on Facebook's news  feed.  Trusted, by the way, by Facebook, not by you, but by Mark Zuckerberg  and his deputies.</p><p> Meanwhile, Twitter is implementing a system to suppress tweets it regards  as harassment, even if those tweets actually break no rules.  In other  words, if Twitter disagrees with the political orientation of the tweets.</p><p> Brett Larson hosts \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" and investigates big tech for  the show.  We're grateful he does.  He joins us tonight.</p><p> BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" HOST:  Hey, Tucker.  Good  to be here.  We have been investigating this story over the past few days  now, involving Facebook changes to how they handle news sources in user's  news feed.</p><p> As you mentioned, in a meeting with media company executives from \"The New  York Times\" to News Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News,  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said they will be relying on user surveys to  determine which news sources are \"broadly trusted.\" Now, the comments were made following Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.   That was at the beginning of the month.  And this is one of the many  changes the social media giant has made in an effort to combat fake news,  fake accounts and bots that help amplify and spread fake information.</p><p> Now, I spoke with Facebook earlier today and they assured me that this  isn't an effort to censor any ideas or beliefs and that the random sampling  of trustworthiness happens frequently to ensure sites are getting a fair  shake.</p><p> It works like this.  A user will be presented with a simple yes or no  question about a news site.  Are you familiar with the site?  A \"yes\"  answer brings up the next question to rate it for trustworthiness on a  scale of 1 to 5.</p><p> Now, what about fake accounts boosting the trustworthiness of a not-so- trustworthy news outlet?  Well, Facebook just this year has removed more  than half a billion fake accounts.</p><p> Further, those headlines like \"They pulled over to help this dog, what  happened next will amaze you.\", not going to get the kind of ranking in  your news feed going forward as the changes are also meant to crackdown on  so-called clickbait and focus more on news, especially local news.  </p><p> Now, as for paying providers for that news, no deal.  Cable operators pay  to carry channels like Fox for their customers.  But when asked if Facebook  will do the same thing, the online giant saying, they don't see a need for  that.</p><p> Despite the fact that they're renewing focus on local news, it would seem  that kind of revenue would breathe life into local newspapers and news  outlets that are struggling to remain relevant and profitable in the age of  digital.</p><p> And, Tucker, these changes aren't helping us feel any better.  In this  effort to see more news from friends and less news from media sites, it  actually puts us in a bad mood because we compare ourselves to our friends  and our peers and we see what we are missing out on.  Think parties and  awesome vacations that we are not on.  Tucker?  </p><p> It's what we all want.  We don't want to be informed, we want to feel bad!</p><p> CARLSON:  Maybe we need a vacation from social media.</p><p> LARSON:  I think we all do.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think we do.  Brett, great to see you.</p><p> LARSON:  Thanks, Tucker.  Good to be here.</p><p> CARLSON:  Up next, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" isn't just ruling the airwaves  in other channels, he's also up to new antics online.  We feel obligated to  bring you the latest on that.  Pretty amusing actually.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Sad news tonight.  The \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" seems to be  unstoppable.  He's taken over the 2018 election cycle in two cable news  networks.  He'll be running for president himself before long.</p><p> But like other ominous entities like killer robots to Jeff Bezos, the  \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" needs energy to function and he gets that through  attention and validation until today.</p><p> He posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he ought to keep going on TV or  give people who aren't creepy porn lawyers a chance.  Thousands have voted.   Ninety three percent want him to keep gumming up the air waves.  Doubtless  his act of crass self-validation will keep \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" fully  operational for at least another 36 hours.  Sad news!</p><p> And on that note, thanks for the hour.

And at the end of that period, we have discovered there is still no evidence at all of collusion between the Donald Trump for President campaign of 2016 and the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Mueller's many supporters in Washington don't seem to care about that. That's because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously. The whole absurd fever dream was always a way for the ruling class to feel better about losing power in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a way for them to avoid thinking about why Trump got elected. And they never have thought about it.</p><p>Along the way, the investigation has provided Democrats with a full year of government-funded oppo research and destroyed the lives of a number of people who supported Donald Trump. There are added bonuses from the Democratic perspective.</p><p>But there have been downsides for Democrats. Voters are not impressed by the Russia story. It is weird and false and confusing. It has precisely nothing to do with voters' actual lives or the issues they vote on. It is a total waste of time for everyone.</p><p>And yet, it's all Democrats have. Trump is evil, so is Russia. That's the entire progressive program of 2018 summarized in two sentences. If the Democratic Party had a Sermon on the Mount, those would be the attitudes. No wonder their approval numbers are falling.</p><p>Republican Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana has introduced a resolution calling for an end to Mueller's investigation or a report within 30 days. He joins us along with fellow Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida. He says he may know the identity of the person who was spied on Trump's campaign for the FBI in 2016.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome to you both tonight. Congressman Rokita, first to you, so this resolution would call for an end to the investigation or a report summarizing its findings so far. Am I misstating that?</p><p>REP. TODD ROKITA (R), INDIANA: No. Both correct, Tucker. The fact of the matter is it's been a year. As you say, it's been $20 million and we need to see a report of what evidence he has. And absent that evidence, it should wind up within 30 days of the resolution passing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why wouldn't other members on both sides in the Congress want some oversight? You are constitutionally bound to provide oversight of the DOJ. So, why are you the only person calling for this?</p><p>ROKITA: Well, I'm not. Matt Gaetz is also calling for it. There's a couple other calling for it, but we need your viewers to call your members of Congress and get them on board. You can only have a free republic, as you know, Tucker, if you have transparency. And this is exactly what we need.</p><p>It is a witch hunt. It has gone beyond an investigation. And the only evidence of collusion that we found, the only evidence of criminality has been on the Democrats.</p><p>So, we're calling on Mueller to show his hand or fold the deck.</p><p>CARLSON: Even if I believed the president colluded with Vladimir Putin, I'd be very concerned about this investigation because the parameters aren't clear. The timeline is opaque. And it's not clear what the point is.</p><p>So, Congressman DeSantis, one of the enduring mysteries of the past two weeks has been the story of a mole or a spy within the Trump campaign feeding information to the Russia investigation.</p><p>Have you any sense who that person might be?</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: Look, I do, Tucker. But I think that the issue needs to go through the proper channels. I'm not comfortable disclosing who I think it is based on the evidence that I have.</p><p>But I can say this, the American people deserve an answer. Up or down, did the FBI direct somebody to spy on Donald Trump's campaign? Was somebody actively working to undermine his campaign and create the illusion of collusion?</p><p>And if that's the case, I think that's more serious than the FISA abuse. I think it's more serious than Rosenstein butchering this whole appointing order with Mueller from the beginning.</p><p>So, we need the answer to those questions. They are not giving us the answers right now, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: They are definitely not. Now, I know you don't want to risk libel by naming someone because this has not been proved in court, but give us a sense of what you are talking about. Are you saying that someone who worked on the Trump campaign fed information to law enforcement?</p><p>DESANTIS: So, if you look at Glenn Simpson's testimony from Fusion GPS, he talked about there being a human source. And that was something that was controversial. Some people said it was Papadopoulos. That's not what he was referring to.</p><p>So, the issue is he acknowledges there's a human source. Peter Strzok, he opens up the counterintelligence investigation in the summer of 2016, what does he do the next day? He goes to Great Britain, he goes to London and he's meeting with people.</p><p>Well, how the heck would you do that if you just opened the investigation that day? So, I think in that kind of - the London, Christopher Steele, Glenn Simpson axis is probably the individual that we're looking at.</p><p>But, I mean, look, we need to know whether this individual was spying or not. I have great concerns about it, but I think we can get those questions' answer when the Justice Department ponies up the documents.</p><p>CARLSON: So, last - you're absolutely right. The last follow-up on that, are you suggesting or do you believe that this is someone who was pressured into cooperating with the investigation or someone who freely sent information over about the campaign?</p><p>DESANTIS: I think it's the latter, Tucker. I think this would be somebody - potentially could have been paid by the FBI, like Steele. There was an agreement to pay Steele.</p><p>We just need an answer to that? Did they pay anybody? Yes or no. Did they direct anyone to go to the campaign? Yes or no. Very easy questions to answer.</p><p>ROKITA: And, Tucker, we need the -</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. I'm sorry, congressman. Please go ahead.</p><p>ROKITA: Yes. Ron DeSantis is exactly right. We also need to know the relationship between Mueller and Comey. Comey kicked this whole thing off with a bogus FISA warrant. And what is the relationship between Mueller and Comey? Did Mueller give Comey immunity? Does Comey think he's about the law? Where are we going with all this? That what needs to be investigated.</p><p>CARLSON: Do believe - quickly, congressman, do you believe that Jim Comey has been offered immunity by the Mueller investigation?</p><p>ROKITA: I think it stands to reason. And I think the American people deserve to know.</p><p>CARLSON: That would be shocking. Congressmen, thank you both. I appreciate that. And I hope you get to the bottom of those. We have a right to know.</p><p>ROKITA: Thanks.</p><p>DESANTIS: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Ted Malloch was an informal advisor to the Donald Trump campaign. In March, he says he was detained at an airport by investigators for Robert Mueller who took away his cell phone and asked about his ties to Roger Stone, among other things. He is also the author of the book, \"The Plot to Destroy Trump: How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to Subvert the President\".</p><p>Ted Malloch joins us tonight. Ted, thank you for coming on.</p><p>TED MALLOCH, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Good evening.</p><p>CARLSON: When you say you were detained, that's kind of a remarkable story. Tell us the circumstances of this.</p><p>MALLOCH: Especially for a Yale, Oxford and a business school professor to be stopped at an airport, taken into a room and asked questions by the FBI and having their phone then under a warrant seized.</p><p>But I write about this in the book as a postscript and my lawyers tell me not to confirm or deny very much about this because I'm still actively participating in this conversation.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't understand. Why would that put you in legal peril if you believe the government overstepped and detained you - this is at Logan Airport in Boston, right? You're flying in from abroad. They pull you aside, take your cell phone and ask you questions. You have no lawyer present, is that correct, during this conversation?</p><p>MALLOCH: None at all.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. So, how - why would you be in jeopardy by exercising your First Amendment right to explain the truth?</p><p>MALLOCH: I have explained it as a postscript to the book and actually detailed it. And I'm told that the FBI is not all that happy about that fact. So, therefore, I'm not really at liberty to say a whole lot more about where this stands at present.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Give us a sense, though. When you sat down, you had no lawyer. It's generally not advised to talk to the FBI without a lawyer. Did they just grab you as you got off the plane? And what did you say to them when they did?</p><p>MALLOCH: Well, they had me wait for about 20 minutes, as I say, and then divided me from my wife and then searched my belongings and took me to a separate building to introduce me to two FBI agents who asked me a series of questions.</p><p>Actually, it was quite chit chatty for about 20 minutes. As a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, they asked me what I thought of their victory at the Super Bowl.</p><p>CARLSON: That's what they said to Mike Flynn too during his chit chatty conversation, I'm sure.</p><p>So, they had a warrant for all of this, I assume. Is that right?</p><p>MALLOCH: Correct.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. What did they ask you?</p><p>MALLOCH: As I said in the postscript, there were very few substantive questions. Some about individuals, what my relationship was to the campaign. They seem to know all the answers to the questions.</p><p>CARLSON: Did you consider saying buzz off, I'm not going to answer your questions?</p><p>MALLOCH: I think had they gotten any more aggressive, then, in fact, that would have been the case, but they were fairly benign. I'm a patriotic American. A cold warrior. I worked in the State Department. I was the top American in the UN in Geneva, Switzerland for four years at the end of the Cold War.</p><p>I'm certainly willing to cooperate in any inquiry. I don't think I have much to add.</p><p>CARLSON: Why do you think they wanted to talk to you?</p><p>MALLOCH: Well, my publisher thinks they had pre-read my book on the plot to destroy the president, which is, in fact, about the conspiracy - the first in American history since 1783 and the Newburgh conspiracy that tried to overthrow a sitting president of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Why did they ask you about Roger Stone?</p><p>MALLOCH: I have no idea. I've met Roger Stone three times. He did write the foreword to my new book because we had the same publisher. He gave an address at Oxford University about 8 or 10 weeks ago and it was a pretty compelling story about what happened in the 2016 election and we had it transcribed. I had attended that lecture. And we used it as the foreword to the book. So, maybe they read more into that than is the case.</p><p>CARLSON: What did they do to your phone? You said they had a warrant for your phone?</p><p>MALLOCH: Yes. They confiscated my phone and I'm told it's been returned to me and I should be receiving it any day.</p><p>CARLSON: They took your phone away? How long have they had it?</p><p>MALLOCH: Well, since that day, which was before Easter.</p><p>CARLSON: I'd be pretty annoyed. Ted, thank you for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>MALLOCH: Good to be with you, Tucker. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Democratic congressional candidate has expressed his real thoughts about the NRA in a new ad, which is completely over-the-top. He joins us next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a politician's job is to appeal to voters. Left-leaning voters don't like the NRA. Pat Davis is a Democrat running for Congress in New Mexico. Put two and two together and Davis has produced a new ad where he expresses his view of the NRA unambiguously, but you decide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAT DAVIS (D), NEW MEXICO CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the NRA. Their program policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers and dead fathers. I'm Pat Davis and I approve this message because if Congress won't change our gun laws, we are changing Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Pat Davis joins us tonight from New Mexico. Pat, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DAVIS: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's the ad? Eff the NRA? Kind of moronic, no?</p><p>DAVIS: That's it, just 15 seconds, but it got a whole lot of attention and started a new conversation about guns and I'm grateful for that.</p><p>CARLSON: But doesn't it degrade you? You use the F word in an ad. I mean, if you have a position, state it, but F the NRA? I mean, come on.</p><p>DAVIS: Well, Tucker, being polite, it hasn't made our schools any safer, it hasn't protected police officers like I used to be. If a cuss word on TV offends you more than pictures of dead children in Parkland or Newtown, then your priorities are all wrong.</p><p>CARLSON: It's not either/or. I don't care if you were a cop or not. Hold on. Wait. Let me ask you a question. It's not an either/or. It's not that I'm so offended. Politeness doesn't work, do you think rudeness will? Is rudeness going to save lives, do you think?</p><p>DAVIS: As we were looking to make this ad, we kept coming up with the same idea. And every ad idea we came up to talk about this issue looked like somebody else's. And those had not worked.</p><p>Clearly, this got the NRA's attention and it has started a new conversation both amongst candidates running for office, about how we organize and take back Congress and put new leaders there to take on control, but also how we stand up to the NRA.</p><p>We know what works. Fifty percent of NRA members support -</p><p>CARLSON: No, it started a conversation about how embarrassing you are. How many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p>DAVIS: Well - but, Tucker, here's the thing. A majority of Americans - 89 percent of police officers, a majority of NRA members know there are common sense things we can do.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. Slow down. You just released an ad that said F the NRA, which I'm sure back at your fraternity house they love. But let me ask you an adult question, how many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p>DAVIS: Tucker, this is about the organization itself. My family grew up, when I was growing up -</p><p>CARLSON: I'm asking you about the organization itself.</p><p>DAVIS: It's not the NRA of my dad's organization.</p><p>CARLSON: F the NRA. But how many of their members - hold on. They have millions of members. How many of them -</p><p>DAVIS: They do. And I've been hearing from them all week. I've been hearing from them all week because the NRA made us their target.</p><p>We've started a new conversation and what I've also heard from are parents in Parkland, in Virginia, in Newtown who donated to keep the ad on the air because they want people in Congress to finally step up.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. So, you're really doing a public service.</p><p>DAVIS: If the NRA wants to come to the table and help us pass common sense regulations that their members support, let's do it.</p><p>CARLSON: Come to the table? You just said F the NRA.</p><p>DAVIS: We are not waiting on them to come to the table.</p><p>CARLSON: You're really trying to have an adult conversation. So, here is your new spot. And I want to talk to policy and see what you know about it. So, here's your latest 15-second ad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVIS: By the time this ad is done, an AR-15 could have fired 150 bullets. That's why we need to ban assault weapons. I'm Pat Davis, running for Congress. And I approve this message because lives are more important than gun company profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, you just said that in 15 seconds an AR-15 can fire 150 rounds. Is that true?</p><p>DAVIS: That's right. You get it right here in New Mexico. Right here in New Mexico, you can go to a parking lot or go on the Internet, buy an assault weapon, an AR-15 and buy a legally available add-on like a bump stock that allows you to replicate exactly what happened in Las Vegas.</p><p>The Las Vegas shooter could shoot 600 rounds a minute.</p><p>CARLSON: You are saying an AR-15 can shoot 150 rounds in 15 seconds. So, would it have a 150-round magazine? What would that - let me ask - let's be specific about your ad. What would that magazine look like, the 150- round magazine?</p><p>DAVIS: Exactly like the magazines the Las Vegas police officers pulled out of that hotel room. They had 50 and 100-round magazines and that weapon was capable -</p><p>CARLSON: So, you could fire - it is physically possible to fire - it's not. I mean, these are rhetorical questions. You don't know what you're talking about. I know that you are a police officer. Or you claim to have been.</p><p>DAVIS: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: No AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds. That's untrue. And if you believe it is true, then you are not qualified to have a conversation about guns. People are laughing at you because you are ignorant. You don't know what you're talking about. No, no, that's just untrue.</p><p>DAVIS: We take exactly the word of the police officers in Las Vegas who I trust who ran into that room to save people down below and found a weapon that was modified with bump stocks.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so they say an AR-15 - what do you think would happen to the barrel in 15 seconds if you put 150 rounds? It would melt.</p><p>DAVIS: I know they get hot.</p><p>CARLSON: So, my point is if you're going to take on the NRA and be Mr. Tough, I was a cop guy, maybe you should know what you're talking about, but you don't.</p><p>You are putting something on television that's demonstrably wrong, that's physically possible, and all of your voters are like, oh, yes, this guy knows what he's talking about, he was a cop, but you don't know. So, maybe you should apologize for it.</p><p>DAVIS: I'm not apologizing for taking on the NRA. I know why I'm pursuing it.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sorry. Politeness doesn't work. I'm just trying to - oh, OK.</p><p>I think you should apologize for saying something that's factually untrue.</p><p>DAVIS: Apologies and politeness have not changed the conversation. We need new focus to take over and decide.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, that's why I'm not being polite. I'm trying to get a real conversation going here. But you don't know what you're talking about, so maybe you shouldn't be in a position to make decisions because you don't understand the issue because you just told me with a straight face that an AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds. Oh, surprise. It can't.</p><p>So, maybe you should admit that and move on to something you understand. Would you do that?</p><p>DAVIS: This is exactly the type of arguments that don't get us where we need to be. We need new leadership in Congress.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, it's not like, F the NRA. That's the kind of argument we need. I thought politeness didn't work, tough guy?</p><p>DAVIS: Politeness is not working so far. If you woke up on Mother's Day and you don't have your kid anymore -</p><p>CARLSON: You know what works actually? Facts work. Why don't you get some facts? Oh, Pat, do you like this new mode of communication we have? F the NRA, Pat.</p><p>DAVIS: It would be great to have a conversation.</p><p>CARLSON: Learn something about funs and get back to me. Interview over. Yes, because you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p>Let's go back to politeness. I like it better. It's another primary night and a Democrat who sounds like Donald Trump could be a winner tonight. Amazing! He will join us.</p><p>Plus, Brit Hume joins us to break down the Democrats' 2018 message or lack thereof. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a Fox News alert. Primary elections held tonight in the State of Pennsylvania, polling places just closed. A court there has radically reshaped the state's congressional boundaries.</p><p>John Morganelli is a Democrat running for Congress in the newly reshaped 7th district in the state's northeast. The district only narrowly supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>And despite his party affiliation, Morganelli is anti-abortion and has called for some restrictions on immigration and sanctuary cities. Mr. Morganelli joins us tonight. Mr. Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOHN MORGANELLI, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Tucker, thanks for having me tonight.</p><p>CARLSON: So, as I understand, there are three candidates, Democratic candidates, running in this primary tonight. Polls have closed. So, we are not affecting anything with his interview.</p><p>But the three candidates each come from a different strain of the Democratic Party ideologically. Describe the kind of Democrat that you are.</p><p>MORGANELLI: Well, Tucker, I've come out of a blue-collar background. My father was a construction worker with a sixth-grade education. My mother was a seamstress with 11th grade education.</p><p>And I believe that I've come out of the sort of the traditional Democratic Party that's concerned about working men and women, that's concerned about the blue-collar issues that affect these folks and I have always believed the John F. Kennedy model and, even to some degree, the Bill Clinton model, who ran as a centrist. And that's pretty much where I have been. I'm not the strain of Democratic Party.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I'm fascinated by the news coverage of your race. So, you've said things that don't seem very controversial, like you are not in favor of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. You are not against all immigration, but you're worried about illegal immigration. And you're not for giving state-subsidized tuition to illegal immigrants.</p><p>For this, you are described as a hard-liner on immigration. Do you think that's fair? Do you think the coverage of that subject is fair?</p><p>MORGANELLI: No, I don't think it's fair. First of all, I'm a grandson of an Italian immigrant and I believe immigration is great. It's made our country great.</p><p>But immigration is a process. There is laws that we have and people have to get in line and come into the country in a legal way. And to describe me as a hard-liner, I think, is not accurate.</p><p>I go to the naturalization service that we have in our county where people from all over the world become naturalized citizens. It's a wonderful ceremony in the courthouse. And those are immigrants.</p><p>What I'm opposed to is just people breaking into our country without permission. Some of them being criminals, and I've seen them in my own county from the MS-13 gang and others.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGANELLI: And then, our country giving incentives for more illegal immigration such as driver's license and state tuition, I don't think those incentives should be given. It just creates more illegal immigration.</p><p>CARLSON: So, Bill Clinton said that exact same thing 20 years ago. Now, you are one of only a couple Democrats willing to say that out loud. What happened to the Democratic Party?</p><p>MORGANELLI: Well, it's interesting. As you know, there is a picture - a video of President Clinton giving, I think, a State of the Union speech where he talks hard-line on immigration. He says everything that I believe in. And even President Obama gave a similar speech. So, this is not out of step with Democrats.</p><p>I mean, in my own community here, I have great support for this position. People here, Democratic voters, I don't think - I guess we'll know better tonight - want foreign criminals coming into the county and setting up shop.</p><p>They don't want sanctuary cities. I have opposed sanctuary cities for a long, long time. Having a sanctuary city is like putting up a big sign that says, please, all foreign criminals, come here because we won't do anything about it if you commit a crime.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>MORGANELLI: So, I don't think that all Democrats are in lockstep necessarily with some of the national philosophy that comes out of Washington on this issue.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, I hope you are right. And the polls have closed, so I can say that I'm certainly rooting for you tonight. John Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>MORGANELLI: Thank you. Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Probably won't help. Well, with some candidates on the Democratic side flipping the bird to the NRA, while others back Trump-style immigration, it's not quite clear what the Democratic message is for 2018.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst. He watches carefully. He joins us tonight. Brit, what do you think the message is? Or is there a national message that the Democratic Party is selling this midterm?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's pretty indistinct at this moment, if there is one, Tucker. I think that much of the party is so mesmerized by Donald Trump and loathes him so deeply that that has become kind of the central thing and the central theme that you can see with the Democratic - that's what the Democratic Party appears to be mostly about right now. I suspect, as time goes on, something more oriented towards voters will come along.</p><p>But, remember, Tucker, these candidates are running in a party where 71 percent, according to one recent poll, want Donald Trump impeached. So, it's kind of understandable that there would be some focus on him.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. For sure. Most Democrats are, of course, very anti-Trump. That's why they are Democrats. But is that a message that moves people to the polls?</p><p>HUME: Well, based on the evidence we have, it seems not to be working very well. And the reason I say that is, look at the advantages that Democrats enjoy going into this midterm election.</p><p>First of all, the political gravity in any president's first midterm is always with the other party and the average loss is more than would be enough - if they made their average again, the Democrats would get control of the House.</p><p>Now, they had a huge gap in what's called the generic ballot. You know, Tucker, that's the one where you ask people if they'd rather vote for a Democrat or Republican unnamed in the upcoming election.</p><p>Normally, Democrats do well on that ballot. They were up plus 15 or 16 at one point not very long ago. And now, that number is down to single digits. And some polls down to low single digits which suggest that whatever they are selling, people are not buying with the enthusiasm that the party had hoped for.</p><p>CARLSON: What will happen if they don't retake the House?</p><p>HUME: Well, I think there will be an agonizing reappraisal because we've been hearing about this blue wave that was thought to be inevitable, and may yet come.</p><p>If it doesn't come, obviously, there's going to be a search for scapegoats. And we will see what happens.</p><p>But this party, I think, Tucker, what we're seeing emerge now is that for all the divisions in the Republican Party between Trump supporters and the never Trumpers and so on and all the divisions within the conservative movement over that, the divisions in the Democratic Party are at least as deep, if not deeper.</p><p>And at the heart of the Democratic Party - I remember you saying in a speech not too many years ago - was not with Hillary Clinton, but she won anyway.</p><p>A candidate of her stripe, I don't think, could win this time. I don't know that a white male candidate could win.</p><p>So, here we are, the Democrats really have some serious divisions to worry about. And whether whatever they come up with will be appealing to a broad cross section of voters is, obviously, what remains to be seen.</p><p>CARLSON: A white male candidate could not win. I don't think a lot of the white male candidates running for the Democratic nomination know that yet, but I think they're going to learn.</p><p>And do you think that it moves in the direction of populist economics, become the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders party?</p><p>HUME: Well, I think that's the drift. And I think that excites a lot of people. And, of course, if you look at the attitudes of young voters now, who do not seem to have grasped the benefits of a market capitalist economy and don't seem to be put off at all about the idea of socialism despite socialism's abysmal history, which is playing out even today in certain parts of the world, Venezuela being the most conspicuous example, but I think the party - it's gotten pretty far left now. And a lot of old ideas that are being passed off as kind of new ideas are in the air.</p><p>And the party will have to reckon with that because if they come up with somebody who is an out and out socialist for president, I don't think they could possibly win. And I'm not sure how many of them we'll see, but there will be awful battles over this.</p><p>CARLSON: Their corporate donors, because the party is entirely supported by corporate America, are going to pretty surprised when it turns out they're sending money to Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p>HUME: Yes. You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Sorry. Go ahead.</p><p>HUME: No, I was just going to say don't underestimate the ability of a leftist candidate to raise money from small donations and make a serious run for it. Bernie Sanders certainly did.</p><p>CARLSON: No, that's right. I just think that Goldman Sachs guys are going to be pretty shocked when they see what's coming. Great to see you.</p><p>HUME: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, an embattled minority group is under attack in South Africa and on the receiving end of genocidal rhetoric. It is considered unacceptable to talk about this in the media in the West for some reason, but we don't care because it's true and it's happening and it's news and we are covering it. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, now to a fascinating and significant story the media have all but ignored. South Africa is a diverse country, but the South African government would like to make it much less diverse.</p><p>An embattled minority of farmers, mostly Afrikaans speaking, is being targeted in a wave of barbaric and horrifying murders.</p><p>But instead of protecting them, the government just passed a law allowing it to seize their farms without any compensation based purely on their ethnicity and distribute those farms to more favored groups.</p><p>Thousands have already migrated out of the country, but they've struggled to attract any sympathy abroad for some reason.</p><p>Ernst Roets is deputy CEO of AfriForum. It's a South Africa civil rights group. He was just in the United States to meet with a number of government officials. He also took a moment to talk to us. Here's part of what he said.</p><p>Ernst Roets joins us now. Mr. Roets, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ERNST ROETS, SOUTH AFRICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Thank you very much.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you describe in this book a disorganized, but in some sense intentional campaign to crush a racial minority within your country and the government seems onboard with it. Is that an overstatement?</p><p>ROETS: Well, what the book is about is it's about government complicity in the scourge of farm attacks and farm murders that we've seen in South Africa.</p><p>So, in only the last two decades, there's been - according to government statistics, which we believe - we have reason to say that it's maybe downplayed a little. There's been about two farm attacks every day and two farm murders every week in South Africa.</p><p>And in the book, I highlight actually ten different reasons why we believe the South African government is complicit. And it stretches from reasons including - the fact that as these attacks have worsened - for example, in 2007, there was a 25 percent increase in these attacks and then the South African government responded saying we're not going to release any more statistics about this.</p><p>Then also, which is very concerning, is the hate speech in South Africa. That's the title of the book as well, \"Kill the Boer\", which is a very popular song which is still being sung in South Africa. It was sung just the other day. So, it's sung at political rallies.</p><p>And, of course, Boer referring to a particular cultural group in South Africa.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ROETS: We have songs like \"Shoot the Boer\", which is a different song. There are a variety of ways in which -</p><p>CARLSON: But I thought that hate speech was now a crime punishable by prison time in South Africa. Are any of the people who say this arrested?</p><p>ROETS: There's a bill on the table to have hate speech declared a crime punishable by prison time. But if you look at the motivation around it, it's very clear that - I think those in government who are pushing this don't regard this as hate speech.</p><p>As a matter of fact, they've been arguing that it's not hate speech in court. So, they would argue that they have a right to sing about killing farmers and then they would say it's an expression of freedom of speech.</p><p>CARLSON: So, now the government has announced that it plans to pursue a policy of taking land away from people on the basis of their skin color. Do you think they'll do that?</p><p>ROETS: Well, that's what was adopted in our parliament in February. A motion was adopted that the property rights clause in the South African constitution has to be changed to allow for expropriation of private property without compensation.</p><p>So, the state president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that this would turn South Africa into the ultimate paradise and the Garden of Eden and Deputy President David Mabuza even went further saying that - basically threatening white farmers that if they do not voluntarily hand over their land to black people, then there would be a violent takeover. So, the situation is very dire in South Africa.</p><p>But the good news is that there is still a process that has to be followed and that's why we are in the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: What I find so striking is the response from everyone else around the world. It's almost never covered in the American media. There is a sense that the people being murdered deserve it because of what their ancestors did. And the international community is similarly silent.</p><p>Have you met with any government officials here in Washington about what's happening in your country?</p><p>ROETS: Well, that's why we are here. We are about to meet with some government officials and it's very unfortunate, the situation that you've just mentioned.</p><p>Especially in South Africa, there's a hierarchy of recognition. So, some people, when they are the victims, it's all over the news and you hear about it frequently. And other people, especially farmers in South Africa, white farmers in particular, they would be tortured to death and it would receive very little news coverage.</p><p>And that's unfortunately the situation abroad as well, which is why we are very grateful to be having this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, a government official in Australia said publicly maybe we ought to allow asylum to people being persecuted for their skin color in your country and he was basically laughed at and then attacked by your government for saying that.</p><p>ROETS: Yes, he was attacked. And they then said that he shouldn't say that because AfriForum was providing them with false information. Well, the information that we're quoting is government statistics.</p><p>So, that is the situation. Whoever speaks out against this - we, just for being in the United States, we've been accused of treason, we've had people threatening us, saying they will wait for us at the airport when we come back and they'll attack us and so forth. We had the state president today in parliament calling on us to go back to South Africa.</p><p>So, whenever you speak out against this, there is a very serious backlash.</p><p>CARLSON: This is not what Nelson Mandela wanted.</p><p>ROETS: No, it's the exact opposite than what he wanted. He spoke about a free country in which people were not judged by the color of their skin. And he even wanted farm attacks to be a priority crime.</p><p>He said that when he was president. And when his presidency was over, they deprioritized it.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you just watch something like this happen in a neighboring country, Zimbabwe, which went from being one of the richest in Africa to the poorest in the world because of farm attacks and because of the theft of private property, is the ANC, the ruling party in South Africa, aware of that lesson?</p><p>ROETS: Well, they are, but you know that saying real communism has never been tried. That's what they keep saying. So, it failed in Zimbabwe. It failed in Cuba. It failed in Venezuela. It failed in Russia. It failed in China. All of those countries.</p><p>And they are basically saying that we're going to try the same thing, but this time it's going to work.</p><p>CARLSON: So, last question. It's considered basically immoral in the United States to talk to you or to hear stories like this for reasons that nobody ever bothers really to explain, but it's just understood.</p><p>If you could speak to our media, to the people who are dismissing your claims as false, what would you say?</p><p>ROETS: Well, I think there are three things. Firstly, everything we say is fact based. It's based on research. But in terms of what we hope to achieve and what people can do, people who want to invest in South Africa, we want them to call on the South African government to say, listen, you are calling on us to invest in your country, but you want to expropriate those investments.</p><p>Number two, we are speaking with the US government and asking them to put pressure on the South African government, which could be done in a variety of ways.</p><p>And number three, members of the public and members of the media, the best thing that you can do to help us is to talk about this, to talk about it on public platforms and in that way to continue to put pressure on the South African government not to continue with this policy.</p><p>CARLSON: Just to tell the truth. I agree. Mr. Roets, thank you.</p><p>ROETS: Thanks very much. Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON: Tech companies are getting more powerful, even as we sleep. Facebook has a plan for ranking news outlets by how trustworthy it says they are, while Twitter plans to just censor certain views entirely. A brave new world has arrived. Details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to fund terrorists in Somalia. That's according to a new report by a Fox affiliate in the twin cities.</p><p>According to that story, many members of Minnesota's Somali immigrant community have discovered they can open sham day care centers that only pretend to watch children, collect a fat subsidy from the state for doing that and keep the change. They have made millions of dollars, up to 100 million according to that report. That would be half of Minnesota's annual budget for child care assistance.</p><p>Again, these are people who are resettled here as an act of charity by our country, accused now of defrauding our country. And not just fraud, fraud so brazen, the report says, that Somalis buy shares in fake day care outlets to get a cut of it.</p><p>Some of this fraudulently obtained money is reportedly being shipped back to Somalia in suitcases full of cash to evade federal wire transfer restrictions.</p><p>Some of this money is ending up in regions of Somalia controlled by the Islamic terror group, Al-Shabab.</p><p>Well, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is outraged by the story. It's not the fraud that makes him mad or the ingratitude or the injustice. It was that it was exposed at all. That offended him.</p><p>In a statement, he denounced the new report on the grounds that it could hinder further cash transfers to Somalia, which apparently he cares more about than America, which he's supposed be representing.</p><p>According to Congressman Ellison, briefcases of untraceable cash in Somalia hurt Al-Shabab rather than helping them somehow.</p><p>Well, apparently, it's not enough for the tech companies to know what you do, and they do know what you do, increasingly they want to control what you do and what you see and what you think.</p><p>During a recent meeting with investors, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that his company has been ranking news outlets by how trustworthy they are, with less trusted outlets being penalized on Facebook's news feed. Trusted, by the way, by Facebook, not by you, but by Mark Zuckerberg and his deputies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter is implementing a system to suppress tweets it regards as harassment, even if those tweets actually break no rules. In other words, if Twitter disagrees with the political orientation of the tweets.</p><p>Brett Larson hosts \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" and investigates big tech for the show. We're grateful he does. He joins us tonight.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" HOST: Hey, Tucker. Good to be here. We have been investigating this story over the past few days now, involving Facebook changes to how they handle news sources in user's news feed.</p><p>As you mentioned, in a meeting with media company executives from \"The New York Times\" to News Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said they will be relying on user surveys to determine which news sources are \"broadly trusted.\" Now, the comments were made following Facebook's F8 Developer Conference. That was at the beginning of the month. And this is one of the many changes the social media giant has made in an effort to combat fake news, fake accounts and bots that help amplify and spread fake information.</p><p>Now, I spoke with Facebook earlier today and they assured me that this isn't an effort to censor any ideas or beliefs and that the random sampling of trustworthiness happens frequently to ensure sites are getting a fair shake.</p><p>It works like this. A user will be presented with a simple yes or no question about a news site. Are you familiar with the site? A \"yes\" answer brings up the next question to rate it for trustworthiness on a scale of 1 to 5.</p><p>Now, what about fake accounts boosting the trustworthiness of a not-so- trustworthy news outlet? Well, Facebook just this year has removed more than half a billion fake accounts.</p><p>Further, those headlines like \"They pulled over to help this dog, what happened next will amaze you.\", not going to get the kind of ranking in your news feed going forward as the changes are also meant to crackdown on so-called clickbait and focus more on news, especially local news.</p><p>Now, as for paying providers for that news, no deal. Cable operators pay to carry channels like Fox for their customers. But when asked if Facebook will do the same thing, the online giant saying, they don't see a need for that.</p><p>Despite the fact that they're renewing focus on local news, it would seem that kind of revenue would breathe life into local newspapers and news outlets that are struggling to remain relevant and profitable in the age of digital.</p><p>And, Tucker, these changes aren't helping us feel any better. In this effort to see more news from friends and less news from media sites, it actually puts us in a bad mood because we compare ourselves to our friends and our peers and we see what we are missing out on. Think parties and awesome vacations that we are not on. Tucker?</p><p>It's what we all want. We don't want to be informed, we want to feel bad!</p><p>CARLSON: Maybe we need a vacation from social media.</p><p>LARSON: I think we all do.</p><p>CARLSON: I think we do. Brett, great to see you.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks, Tucker. Good to be here.</p><p>CARLSON: Up next, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" isn't just ruling the airwaves in other channels, he's also up to new antics online. We feel obligated to bring you the latest on that. Pretty amusing actually. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Sad news tonight. The \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" seems to be unstoppable. He's taken over the 2018 election cycle in two cable news networks. He'll be running for president himself before long.</p><p>But like other ominous entities like killer robots to Jeff Bezos, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" needs energy to function and he gets that through attention and validation until today.</p><p>He posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he ought to keep going on TV or give people who aren't creepy porn lawyers a chance. Thousands have voted. Ninety three percent want him to keep gumming up the air waves.

And at the end of that period, we have  discovered there is still no evidence at all of collusion between the  Donald Trump for President campaign of 2016 and the Russian government.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Mueller's many supporters in Washington don't seem to care about that.   That's because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously.  The  whole absurd fever dream was always a way for the ruling class to feel  better about losing power in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It was a way for them to avoid thinking about why Trump got elected.  And  they never have thought about it.</p><p> Along the way, the investigation has provided Democrats with a full year of  government-funded oppo research and destroyed the lives of a number of  people who supported Donald Trump.  There are added bonuses from the  Democratic perspective.</p><p> But there have been downsides for Democrats.  Voters are not impressed by  the Russia story.  It is weird and false and confusing.  It has precisely  nothing to do with voters' actual lives or the issues they vote on.  It is  a total waste of time for everyone.</p><p> And yet, it's all Democrats have.  Trump is evil, so is Russia.  That's the  entire progressive program of 2018 summarized in two sentences.  If the  Democratic Party had a Sermon on the Mount, those would be the attitudes.   No wonder their approval numbers are falling.</p><p> Republican Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana has introduced a resolution  calling for an end to Mueller's investigation or a report within 30 days.   He joins us along with fellow Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida.  He says  he may know the identity of the person who was spied on Trump's campaign  for the FBI in 2016.</p><p> Gentlemen, welcome to you both tonight.  Congressman Rokita, first to you,  so this resolution would call for an end to the investigation or a report  summarizing its findings so far.  Am I misstating that?</p><p> REP. TODD ROKITA (R), INDIANA:  No.  Both correct, Tucker.  The fact of the  matter is it's been a year.  As you say, it's been $20 million and we need  to see a report of what evidence he has.  And absent that evidence, it  should wind up within 30 days of the resolution passing.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, why wouldn't other members on both sides in the Congress want  some oversight?  You are constitutionally bound to provide oversight of the  DOJ.  So, why are you the only person calling for this?</p><p> ROKITA:  Well, I'm not.  Matt Gaetz is also calling for it.  There's a  couple other calling for it, but we need your viewers to call your members  of Congress and get them on board.  You can only have a free republic, as  you know, Tucker, if you have transparency.  And this is exactly what we  need.</p><p> It is a witch hunt.  It has gone beyond an investigation.  And the only  evidence of collusion that we found, the only evidence of criminality has  been on the Democrats.</p><p> So, we're calling on Mueller to show his hand or fold the deck.</p><p> CARLSON:  Even if I believed the president colluded with Vladimir Putin,  I'd be very concerned about this investigation because the parameters  aren't clear.  The timeline is opaque.  And it's not clear what the point  is.</p><p> So, Congressman DeSantis, one of the enduring mysteries of the past two  weeks has been the story of a mole or a spy within the Trump campaign  feeding information to the Russia investigation.</p><p> Have you any sense who that person might be?</p><p> REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Look, I do, Tucker.  But I think that the  issue needs to go through the proper channels.  I'm not comfortable  disclosing who I think it is based on the evidence that I have.</p><p> But I can say this, the American people deserve an answer.  Up or down, did  the FBI direct somebody to spy on Donald Trump's campaign?  Was somebody  actively working to undermine his campaign and create the illusion of  collusion?</p><p> And if that's the case, I think that's more serious than the FISA abuse.  I  think it's more serious than Rosenstein butchering this whole appointing  order with Mueller from the beginning.</p><p> So, we need the answer to those questions.  They are not giving us the  answers right now, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are definitely not.  Now, I know you don't want to risk  libel by naming someone because this has not been proved in court, but give  us a sense of what you are talking about.  Are you saying that someone who  worked on the Trump campaign fed information to law enforcement?</p><p> DESANTIS:  So, if you look at Glenn Simpson's testimony from Fusion GPS, he  talked about there being a human source.  And that was something that was  controversial.  Some people said it was Papadopoulos.  That's not what he  was referring to.  </p><p> So, the issue is he acknowledges there's a human source.  Peter Strzok, he  opens up the counterintelligence investigation in the summer of 2016, what  does he do the next day?  He goes to Great Britain, he goes to London and  he's meeting with people.</p><p> Well, how the heck would you do that if you just opened the investigation  that day?  So, I think in that kind of - the London, Christopher Steele,  Glenn Simpson axis is probably the individual that we're looking at.</p><p> But, I mean, look, we need to know whether this individual was spying or  not.  I have great concerns about it, but I think we can get those  questions' answer when the Justice Department ponies up the documents.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, last - you're absolutely right.  The last follow-up on that,  are you suggesting or do you believe that this is someone who was pressured  into cooperating with the investigation or someone who freely sent  information over about the campaign?</p><p> DESANTIS:  I think it's the latter, Tucker.  I think this would be somebody  - potentially could have been paid by the FBI, like Steele.  There was an  agreement to pay Steele.</p><p> We just need an answer to that?  Did they pay anybody?  Yes or no.  Did  they direct anyone to go to the campaign?  Yes or no.  Very easy questions  to answer.</p><p> ROKITA:  And, Tucker, we need the -</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.  I'm sorry, congressman.  Please go ahead.</p><p> ROKITA:  Yes.  Ron DeSantis is exactly right.  We also need to know the  relationship between Mueller and Comey.  Comey kicked this whole thing off  with a bogus FISA warrant.  And what is the relationship between Mueller  and Comey?  Did Mueller give Comey immunity?  Does Comey think he's about  the law?  Where are we going with all this?  That what needs to be  investigated.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Do believe - quickly, congressman, do you believe that Jim Comey  has been offered immunity by the Mueller investigation?</p><p> ROKITA:  I think it stands to reason.  And I think the American people  deserve to know.</p><p> CARLSON:  That would be shocking.  Congressmen, thank you both.  I  appreciate that.  And I hope you get to the bottom of those.  We have a  right to know.</p><p> ROKITA:  Thanks.</p><p> DESANTIS:  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Ted Malloch was an informal advisor to the Donald Trump campaign.   In March, he says he was detained at an airport by investigators for Robert  Mueller who took away his cell phone and asked about his ties to Roger  Stone, among other things.  He is also the author of the book, \"The Plot to  Destroy Trump:  How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to  Subvert the President\".  </p><p> Ted Malloch joins us tonight.  Ted, thank you for coming on.</p><p> TED MALLOCH, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Good evening.</p><p> CARLSON:  When you say you were detained, that's kind of a remarkable  story.  Tell us the circumstances of this.</p><p> MALLOCH:  Especially for a Yale, Oxford and a business school professor to  be stopped at an airport, taken into a room and asked questions by the FBI  and having their phone then under a warrant seized.</p><p> But I write about this in the book as a postscript and my lawyers tell me  not to confirm or deny very much about this because I'm still actively  participating in this conversation.</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't understand.  Why would that put you in legal peril if you  believe the government overstepped and detained you - this is at Logan  Airport in Boston, right?  You're flying in from abroad.  They pull you  aside, take your cell phone and ask you questions.  You have no lawyer  present, is that correct, during this conversation?</p><p> MALLOCH:  None at all.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  So, how - why would you be in jeopardy by exercising your  First Amendment right to explain the truth?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I have explained it as a postscript to the book and actually  detailed it.  And I'm told that the FBI is not all that happy about that  fact.  So, therefore, I'm not really at liberty to say a whole lot more  about where this stands at present.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  Give us a sense, though.  When you sat down, you had no  lawyer.  It's generally not advised to talk to the FBI without a lawyer.   Did they just grab you as you got off the plane?  And what did you say to  them when they did?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, they had me wait for about 20 minutes, as I say, and then  divided me from my wife and then searched my belongings and took me to a  separate building to introduce me to two FBI agents who asked me a series  of questions.</p><p> Actually, it was quite chit chatty for about 20 minutes.  As a fan of the  Philadelphia Eagles, they asked me what I thought of their victory at the  Super Bowl.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's what they said to Mike Flynn too during his chit chatty  conversation, I'm sure.  </p><p> So, they had a warrant for all of this, I assume.  Is that right?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Correct.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  What did they ask you?</p><p> MALLOCH:  As I said in the postscript, there were very few substantive  questions.  Some about individuals, what my relationship was to the  campaign.  They seem to know all the answers to the questions.</p><p> CARLSON:  Did you consider saying buzz off, I'm not going to answer your  questions?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I think had they gotten any more aggressive, then, in fact, that  would have been the case, but they were fairly benign.  I'm a patriotic  American.  A cold warrior.  I worked in the State Department.  I was the  top American in the UN in Geneva, Switzerland for four years at the end of  the Cold War.</p><p> I'm certainly willing to cooperate in any inquiry.  I don't think I have  much to add.</p><p> CARLSON:  Why do you think they wanted to talk to you?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, my publisher thinks they had pre-read my book on the plot  to destroy the president, which is, in fact, about the conspiracy - the  first in American history since 1783 and the Newburgh conspiracy that tried  to overthrow a sitting president of the United States.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Why did they ask you about Roger Stone?</p><p> MALLOCH:  I have no idea.  I've met Roger Stone three times.  He did write  the foreword to my new book because we had the same publisher.  He gave an  address at Oxford University about 8 or 10 weeks ago and it was a pretty  compelling story about what happened in the 2016 election and we had it  transcribed.  I had attended that lecture.  And we used it as the foreword  to the book.  So, maybe they read more into that than is the case.</p><p> CARLSON:  What did they do to your phone?  You said they had a warrant for  your phone?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Yes.  They confiscated my phone and I'm told it's been returned  to me and I should be receiving it any day.</p><p> CARLSON:  They took your phone away?  How long have they had it?</p><p> MALLOCH:  Well, since that day, which was before Easter.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'd be pretty annoyed.  Ted, thank you for joining us.  I  appreciate it.</p><p> MALLOCH:  Good to be with you, Tucker.  Thanks.</p><p> CARLSON:  Democratic congressional candidate has expressed his real  thoughts about the NRA in a new ad, which is completely over-the-top.  He  joins us next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a politician's job is to appeal to voters.  Left-leaning  voters don't like the NRA.  Pat Davis is a Democrat running for Congress in  New Mexico.  Put two and two together and Davis has produced a new ad where  he expresses his view of the NRA unambiguously, but you decide.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PAT DAVIS (D), NEW MEXICO CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the  NRA.  Their program policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers  and dead fathers.  I'm Pat Davis and I approve this message because if  Congress won't change our gun laws, we are changing Congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Pat Davis joins us tonight from New Mexico.  Pat, thanks for  coming on.</p><p> DAVIS:  Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, that's the ad?  Eff the NRA?  Kind of moronic, no?</p><p> DAVIS:  That's it, just 15 seconds, but it got a whole lot of attention and  started a new conversation about guns and I'm grateful for that.</p><p> CARLSON:  But doesn't it degrade you?  You use the F word in an ad.  I  mean, if you have a position, state it, but F the NRA?  I mean, come on.</p><p> DAVIS:  Well, Tucker, being polite, it hasn't made our schools any safer,  it hasn't protected police officers like I used to be.  If a cuss word on  TV offends you more than pictures of dead children in Parkland or Newtown,  then your priorities are all wrong.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's not either/or.  I don't care if you were a cop or not.  Hold  on.  Wait.  Let me ask you a question.  It's not an either/or.  It's not  that I'm so offended.  Politeness doesn't work, do you think rudeness will?   Is rudeness going to save lives, do you think?</p><p> DAVIS:  As we were looking to make this ad, we kept coming up with the same  idea.  And every ad idea we came up to talk about this issue looked like  somebody else's.  And those had not worked.</p><p> Clearly, this got the NRA's attention and it has started a new conversation  both amongst candidates running for office, about how we organize and take  back Congress and put new leaders there to take on control, but also how we  stand up to the NRA.</p><p> We know what works.  Fifty percent of NRA members support - </p><p> CARLSON:  No, it started a conversation about how embarrassing you are.   How many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p> DAVIS:  Well - but, Tucker, here's the thing.  A majority of Americans - 89  percent of police officers, a majority of NRA members know there are common  sense things we can do.</p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  Slow down.  You just released an ad that said F the  NRA, which I'm sure back at your fraternity house they love.  But let me  ask you an adult question, how many NRA members have committed mass  shootings?</p><p> DAVIS:  Tucker, this is about the organization itself.  My family grew up,  when I was growing up - </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm asking you about the organization itself.</p><p> DAVIS:  It's not the NRA of my dad's organization.</p><p> CARLSON:  F the NRA.  But how many of their members - hold on.  They have  millions of members.  How many of them - </p><p> DAVIS:  They do.  And I've been hearing from them all week.  I've been  hearing from them all week because the NRA made us their target.</p><p> We've started a new conversation and what I've also heard from are parents  in Parkland, in Virginia, in Newtown who donated to keep the ad on the air  because they want people in Congress to finally step up.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.  So, you're really doing a public service.</p><p> DAVIS:  If the NRA wants to come to the table and help us pass common sense  regulations that their members support, let's do it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Come to the table?  You just said F the NRA.</p><p> DAVIS:  We are not waiting on them to come to the table.</p><p> CARLSON:  You're really trying to have an adult conversation.  So, here is  your new spot.  And I want to talk to policy and see what you know about  it.  So, here's your latest 15-second ad.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVIS:  By the time this ad is done, an AR-15 could have fired 150 bullets.   That's why we need to ban assault weapons.  I'm Pat Davis, running for  Congress.  And I approve this message because lives are more important than  gun company profits.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just said that in 15 seconds an AR-15 can fire 150  rounds.  Is that true?</p><p> DAVIS:  That's right.  You get it right here in New Mexico.  Right here in  New Mexico, you can go to a parking lot or go on the Internet, buy an  assault weapon, an AR-15 and buy a legally available add-on like a bump  stock that allows you to replicate exactly what happened in Las Vegas.</p><p> The Las Vegas shooter could shoot 600 rounds a minute.</p><p> CARLSON:  You are saying an AR-15 can shoot 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  So,  would it have a 150-round magazine?  What would that - let me ask - let's  be specific about your ad.  What would that magazine look like, the 150- round magazine?</p><p> DAVIS:  Exactly like the magazines the Las Vegas police officers pulled out  of that hotel room.  They had 50 and 100-round magazines and that weapon  was capable -</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you could fire - it is physically possible to fire - it's  not.  I mean, these are rhetorical questions.  You don't know what you're  talking about.  I know that you are a police officer.  Or you claim to have  been.</p><p> DAVIS:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  No AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  That's untrue.  And  if you believe it is true, then you are not qualified to have a  conversation about guns.  People are laughing at you because you are  ignorant.  You don't know what you're talking about.  No, no, that's just  untrue.</p><p> DAVIS:  We take exactly the word of the police officers in Las Vegas who I  trust who ran into that room to save people down below and found a weapon  that was modified with bump stocks.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, so they say an AR-15 - what do you think would happen to the  barrel in 15 seconds if you put 150 rounds?  It would melt.</p><p> DAVIS:  I know they get hot.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, my point is if you're going to take on the NRA and be Mr.  Tough, I was a cop guy, maybe you should know what you're talking about,  but you don't.</p><p> You are putting something on television that's demonstrably wrong, that's  physically possible, and all of your voters are like, oh, yes, this guy  knows what he's talking about, he was a cop, but you don't know.  So, maybe  you should apologize for it.</p><p> DAVIS:  I'm not apologizing for taking on the NRA.  I know why I'm pursuing  it.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm sorry.  Politeness doesn't work.  I'm just trying to - oh,  OK.</p><p> I think you should apologize for saying something that's factually untrue.</p><p> DAVIS:  Apologies and politeness have not changed the conversation.  We  need new focus to take over and decide.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, that's why I'm not being polite.  I'm trying to get a real  conversation going here.  But you don't know what you're talking about, so  maybe you shouldn't be in a position to make decisions because you don't  understand the issue because you just told me with a straight face that an  AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  Oh, surprise.  It can't.</p><p> So, maybe you should admit that and move on to something you understand.   Would you do that?</p><p> DAVIS:  This is exactly the type of arguments that don't get us where we  need to be.  We need new leadership in Congress.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, it's not like, F the NRA.  That's the kind of argument we  need.  I thought politeness didn't work, tough guy?</p><p> DAVIS:  Politeness is not working so far.  If you woke up on Mother's Day  and you don't have your kid anymore -</p><p> CARLSON:  You know what works actually?  Facts work.  Why don't you get  some facts?  Oh, Pat, do you like this new mode of communication we have?   F the NRA, Pat.</p><p> DAVIS:  It would be great to have a conversation.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Learn something about funs and get back to me.  Interview over.   Yes, because you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p> Let's go back to politeness.  I like it better.  It's another primary night  and a Democrat who sounds like Donald Trump could be a winner tonight.   Amazing! He will join us.</p><p> Plus, Brit Hume joins us to break down the Democrats' 2018 message or lack  thereof.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  This is a Fox News alert.  Primary elections held tonight in the  State of Pennsylvania, polling places just closed.  A court there has  radically reshaped the state's congressional boundaries.</p><p> John Morganelli is a Democrat running for Congress in the newly reshaped  7th district in the state's northeast.  The district only narrowly  supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p> And despite his party affiliation, Morganelli is anti-abortion and has  called for some restrictions on immigration and sanctuary cities.  Mr.  Morganelli joins us tonight.  Mr. Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p> JOHN MORGANELLI, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Tucker, thanks for  having me tonight.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, as I understand, there are three candidates, Democratic  candidates, running in this primary tonight.  Polls have closed.  So, we  are not affecting anything with his interview.</p><p> But the three candidates each come from a different strain of the  Democratic Party ideologically.  Describe the kind of Democrat that you  are.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Well, Tucker, I've come out of a blue-collar background.  My  father was a construction worker with a sixth-grade education.  My mother  was a seamstress with 11th grade education.</p><p> And I believe that I've come out of the sort of the traditional Democratic  Party that's concerned about working men and women, that's concerned about  the blue-collar issues that affect these folks and I have always believed  the John F.  Kennedy model and, even to some degree, the Bill Clinton  model, who ran as a centrist.  And that's pretty much where I have been.   I'm not the strain of Democratic Party.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I'm fascinated by the news coverage of your race.  So, you've  said things that don't seem very controversial, like you are not in favor  of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.  You are not against all  immigration, but you're worried about illegal immigration.  And you're not  for giving state-subsidized tuition to illegal immigrants.</p><p> For this, you are described as a hard-liner on immigration.  Do you think  that's fair?  Do you think the coverage of that subject is fair?</p><p> MORGANELLI:  No, I don't think it's fair.  First of all, I'm a grandson of  an Italian immigrant and I believe immigration is great.  It's made our  country great.</p><p> But immigration is a process.  There is laws that we have and people have  to get in line and come into the country in a legal way.  And to describe  me as a hard-liner, I think, is not accurate.  </p><p> I go to the naturalization service that we have in our county where people  from all over the world become naturalized citizens.  It's a wonderful  ceremony in the courthouse.  And those are immigrants.</p><p> What I'm opposed to is just people breaking into our country without  permission.  Some of them being criminals, and I've seen them in my own  county from the MS-13 gang and others.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  And then, our country giving incentives for more illegal  immigration such as driver's license and state tuition, I don't think those  incentives should be given.  It just creates more illegal immigration.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, Bill Clinton said that exact same thing 20 years ago.  Now,  you are one of only a couple Democrats willing to say that out loud.  What  happened to the Democratic Party?</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Well, it's interesting.  As you know, there is a picture - a  video of President Clinton giving, I think, a State of the Union speech  where he talks hard-line on immigration.  He says everything that I believe  in.  And even President Obama gave a similar speech.  So, this is not out  of step with Democrats.</p><p> I mean, in my own community here, I have great support for this position.   People here, Democratic voters, I don't think - I guess we'll know better  tonight - want foreign criminals coming into the county and setting up  shop.</p><p> They don't want sanctuary cities.  I have opposed sanctuary cities for a  long, long time.  Having a sanctuary city is like putting up a big sign  that says, please, all foreign criminals, come here because we won't do  anything about it if you commit a crime.</p><p> CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  So, I don't think that all Democrats are in lockstep  necessarily with some of the national philosophy that comes out of  Washington on this issue.</p><p> CARLSON:  Man, I hope you are right.  And the polls have closed, so I can  say that I'm certainly rooting for you tonight.  John Morganelli, thanks a  lot for coming on.</p><p> MORGANELLI:  Thank you.  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Probably won't help.  Well, with some candidates on the  Democratic side flipping the bird to the NRA, while others back Trump-style  immigration, it's not quite clear what the Democratic message is for 2018.</p><p> Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst.  He watches carefully.  He  joins us tonight.  Brit, what do you think the message is?  Or is there a  national message that the Democratic Party is selling this midterm?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it's pretty  indistinct at this moment, if there is one, Tucker.  I think that much of  the party is so mesmerized by Donald Trump and loathes him so deeply that  that has become kind of the central thing and the central theme that you  can see with the Democratic - that's what the Democratic Party appears to  be mostly about right now.  I suspect, as time goes on, something more  oriented towards voters will come along.</p><p> But, remember, Tucker, these candidates are running in a party where 71  percent, according to one recent poll, want Donald Trump impeached.  So,  it's kind of understandable that there would be some focus on him.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  For sure.  Most Democrats are, of course, very anti-Trump.   That's why they are Democrats.  But is that a message that moves people to  the polls?</p><p> HUME:  Well, based on the evidence we have, it seems not to be working very  well.  And the reason I say that is, look at the advantages that Democrats  enjoy going into this midterm election.</p><p> First of all, the political gravity in any president's first midterm is  always with the other party and the average loss is more than would be  enough - if they made their average again, the Democrats would get control  of the House.</p><p> Now, they had a huge gap in what's called the generic ballot.  You know,  Tucker, that's the one where you ask people if they'd rather vote for a  Democrat or Republican unnamed in the upcoming election.</p><p> Normally, Democrats do well on that ballot.  They were up plus 15 or 16 at  one point not very long ago.  And now, that number is down to single  digits.  And some polls down to low single digits which suggest that  whatever they are selling, people are not buying with the enthusiasm that  the party had hoped for.</p><p> CARLSON:  What will happen if they don't retake the House?</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think there will be an agonizing reappraisal because we've  been hearing about this blue wave that was thought to be inevitable, and  may yet come.</p><p> If it doesn't come, obviously, there's going to be a search for scapegoats.   And we will see what happens.</p><p> But this party, I think, Tucker, what we're seeing emerge now is that for  all the divisions in the Republican Party between Trump supporters and the  never Trumpers and so on and all the divisions within the conservative  movement over that, the divisions in the Democratic Party are at least as  deep, if not deeper.  </p><p> And at the heart of the Democratic Party - I remember you saying in a  speech not too many years ago - was not with Hillary Clinton, but she won  anyway.</p><p> A candidate of her stripe, I don't think, could win this time.  I don't  know that a white male candidate could win.</p><p> So, here we are, the Democrats really have some serious divisions to worry  about.  And whether whatever they come up with will be appealing to a broad  cross section of voters is, obviously, what remains to be seen.</p><p> CARLSON:  A white male candidate could not win.  I don't think a lot of the  white male candidates running for the Democratic nomination know that yet,  but I think they're going to learn.</p><p> And do you think that it moves in the direction of populist economics,  become the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders party?</p><p> HUME:  Well, I think that's the drift.  And I think that excites a lot of  people.  And, of course, if you look at the attitudes of young voters now,  who do not seem to have grasped the benefits of a market capitalist economy  and don't seem to be put off at all about the idea of socialism despite  socialism's abysmal history, which is playing out even today in certain  parts of the world, Venezuela being the most conspicuous example, but I  think the party - it's gotten pretty far left now.  And a lot of old ideas  that are being passed off as kind of new ideas are in the air.</p><p> And the party will have to reckon with that because if they come up with  somebody who is an out and out socialist for president, I don't think they  could possibly win.  And I'm not sure how many of them we'll see, but there  will be awful battles over this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Their corporate donors, because the party is entirely supported  by corporate America, are going to pretty surprised when it turns out  they're sending money to Hugo Chavez.</p><p> Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p> HUME:  Yes.  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p> HUME:  No, I was just going to say don't underestimate the ability of a  leftist candidate to raise money from small donations and make a serious  run for it.  Bernie Sanders certainly did.</p><p> CARLSON:  No, that's right.  I just think that Goldman Sachs guys are going  to be pretty shocked when they see what's coming.  Great to see you.</p><p> HUME:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, an embattled minority group is under attack in South Africa  and on the receiving end of genocidal rhetoric.  It is considered  unacceptable to talk about this in the media in the West for some reason,  but we don't care because it's true and it's happening and it's news and we  are covering it.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, now to a fascinating and significant story the media have  all but ignored.  South Africa is a diverse country, but the South African  government would like to make it much less diverse.</p><p> An embattled minority of farmers, mostly Afrikaans speaking, is being  targeted in a wave of barbaric and horrifying murders.</p><p> But instead of protecting them, the government just passed a law allowing  it to seize their farms without any compensation based purely on their  ethnicity and distribute those farms to more favored groups.</p><p> Thousands have already migrated out of the country, but they've struggled  to attract any sympathy abroad for some reason.</p><p> Ernst Roets is deputy CEO of AfriForum.  It's a South Africa civil rights  group.  He was just in the United States to meet with a number of  government officials.  He also took a moment to talk to us.  Here's part of  what he said.</p><p> Ernst Roets joins us now.  Mr. Roets, thanks for coming on.</p><p> ERNST ROETS, SOUTH AFRICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Thank you very much.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you describe in this book a disorganized, but in some sense  intentional campaign to crush a racial minority within your country and the  government seems onboard with it.  Is that an overstatement?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, what the book is about is it's about government complicity in  the scourge of farm attacks and farm murders that we've seen in South  Africa.</p><p> So, in only the last two decades, there's been - according to government  statistics, which we believe - we have reason to say that it's maybe  downplayed a little.  There's been about two farm attacks every day and two  farm murders every week in South Africa.</p><p> And in the book, I highlight actually ten different reasons why we believe  the South African government is complicit.  And it stretches from reasons  including - the fact that as these attacks have worsened - for example, in  2007, there was a 25 percent increase in these attacks and then the South  African government responded saying we're not going to release any more  statistics about this.</p><p> Then also, which is very concerning, is the hate speech in South Africa.   That's the title of the book as well, \"Kill the Boer\", which is a very  popular song which is still being sung in South Africa.  It was sung just  the other day.  So, it's sung at political rallies.</p><p> And, of course, Boer referring to a particular cultural group in South  Africa.</p><p> CARLSON:  Right.</p><p> ROETS:  We have songs like \"Shoot the Boer\", which is a different song.   There are a variety of ways in which - </p><p> CARLSON:  But I thought that hate speech was now a crime punishable by  prison time in South Africa.  Are any of the people who say this arrested?</p><p> ROETS:  There's a bill on the table to have hate speech declared a crime  punishable by prison time.  But if you look at the motivation around it,  it's very clear that - I think those in government who are pushing this  don't regard this as hate speech.</p><p> As a matter of fact, they've been arguing that it's not hate speech in  court.  So, they would argue that they have a right to sing about killing  farmers and then they would say it's an expression of freedom of speech.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, now the government has announced that it plans to pursue a  policy of taking land away from people on the basis of their skin color.   Do you think they'll do that?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, that's what was adopted in our parliament in February.  A  motion was adopted that the property rights clause in the South African  constitution has to be changed to allow for expropriation of private  property without compensation.</p><p> So, the state president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that this would turn South  Africa into the ultimate paradise and the Garden of Eden and Deputy  President David Mabuza even went further saying that - basically  threatening white farmers that if they do not voluntarily hand over their  land to black people, then there would be a violent takeover.  So, the  situation is very dire in South Africa.</p><p> But the good news is that there is still a process that has to be followed  and that's why we are in the United States.</p><p> CARLSON:  What I find so striking is the response from everyone else around  the world.  It's almost never covered in the American media.  There is a  sense that the people being murdered deserve it because of what their  ancestors did.  And the international community is similarly silent.</p><p> Have you met with any government officials here in Washington about what's  happening in your country?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, that's why we are here.  We are about to meet with some  government officials and it's very unfortunate, the situation that you've  just mentioned.</p><p> Especially in South Africa, there's a hierarchy of recognition.  So, some  people, when they are the victims, it's all over the news and you hear  about it frequently.  And other people, especially farmers in South Africa,  white farmers in particular, they would be tortured to death and it would  receive very little news coverage.</p><p> And that's unfortunately the situation abroad as well, which is why we are  very grateful to be having this.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, a government official in Australia said publicly maybe we  ought to allow asylum to people being persecuted for their skin color in  your country and he was basically laughed at and then attacked by your  government for saying that.</p><p> ROETS:  Yes, he was attacked.  And they then said that he shouldn't say  that because AfriForum was providing them with false information.  Well,  the information that we're quoting is government statistics.</p><p> So, that is the situation.  Whoever speaks out against this - we, just for  being in the United States, we've been accused of treason, we've had people  threatening us, saying they will wait for us at the airport when we come  back and they'll attack us and so forth.  We had the state president today  in parliament calling on us to go back to South Africa.</p><p> So, whenever you speak out against this, there is a very serious backlash.</p><p> CARLSON:  This is not what Nelson Mandela wanted.</p><p> ROETS:  No, it's the exact opposite than what he wanted.  He spoke about a  free country in which people were not judged by the color of their skin.   And he even wanted farm attacks to be a priority crime.</p><p> He said that when he was president.  And when his presidency was over, they  deprioritized it.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, you just watch something like this happen in a neighboring  country, Zimbabwe, which went from being one of the richest in Africa to  the poorest in the world because of farm attacks and because of the theft  of private property, is the ANC, the ruling party in South Africa, aware of  that lesson?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, they are, but you know that saying real communism has never  been tried.  That's what they keep saying.  So, it failed in Zimbabwe.  It  failed in Cuba.  It failed in Venezuela.  It failed in Russia.  It failed  in China.  All of those countries.</p><p> And they are basically saying that we're going to try the same thing, but  this time it's going to work.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, last question.  It's considered basically immoral in the  United States to talk to you or to hear stories like this for reasons that  nobody ever bothers really to explain, but it's just understood.</p><p> If you could speak to our media, to the people who are dismissing your  claims as false, what would you say?</p><p> ROETS:  Well, I think there are three things.  Firstly, everything we say  is fact based.  It's based on research.  But in terms of what we hope to  achieve and what people can do, people who want to invest in South Africa,  we want them to call on the South African government to say, listen, you  are calling on us to invest in your country, but you want to expropriate  those investments.</p><p> Number two, we are speaking with the US government and asking them to put  pressure on the South African government, which could be done in a variety  of ways.</p><p> And number three, members of the public and members of the media, the best  thing that you can do to help us is to talk about this, to talk about it on  public platforms and in that way to continue to put pressure on the South  African government not to continue with this policy.  </p><p> CARLSON:  Just to tell the truth.  I agree.  Mr. Roets, thank you.</p><p> ROETS:  Thanks very much.  Thank you for being here.</p><p> CARLSON:  Tech companies are getting more powerful, even as we sleep.   Facebook has a plan for ranking news outlets by how trustworthy it says  they are, while Twitter plans to just censor certain views entirely.  A  brave new world has arrived.  Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to fund  terrorists in Somalia.  That's according to a new report by a Fox affiliate  in the twin cities.</p><p> According to that story, many members of Minnesota's Somali immigrant  community have discovered they can open sham day care centers that only  pretend to watch children, collect a fat subsidy from the state for doing  that and keep the change.  They have made millions of dollars, up to 100  million according to that report.  That would be half of Minnesota's annual  budget for child care assistance.</p><p> Again, these are people who are resettled here as an act of charity by our  country, accused now of defrauding our country.  And not just fraud, fraud  so brazen, the report says, that Somalis buy shares in fake day care  outlets to get a cut of it.</p><p> Some of this fraudulently obtained money is reportedly being shipped back  to Somalia in suitcases full of cash to evade federal wire transfer  restrictions.</p><p> Some of this money is ending up in regions of Somalia controlled by the  Islamic terror group, Al-Shabab.</p><p> Well, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is outraged by the  story.  It's not the fraud that makes him mad or the ingratitude or the  injustice.  It was that it was exposed at all.  That offended him.</p><p> In a statement, he denounced the new report on the grounds that it could  hinder further cash transfers to Somalia, which apparently he cares more  about than America, which he's supposed be representing.</p><p> According to Congressman Ellison, briefcases of untraceable cash in Somalia  hurt Al-Shabab rather than helping them somehow.</p><p> Well, apparently, it's not enough for the tech companies to know what you  do, and they do know what you do, increasingly they want to control what  you do and what you see and what you think.</p><p> During a recent meeting with investors, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  revealed that his company has been ranking news outlets by how trustworthy  they are, with less trusted outlets being penalized on Facebook's news  feed.  Trusted, by the way, by Facebook, not by you, but by Mark Zuckerberg  and his deputies.</p><p> Meanwhile, Twitter is implementing a system to suppress tweets it regards  as harassment, even if those tweets actually break no rules.  In other  words, if Twitter disagrees with the political orientation of the tweets.</p><p> Brett Larson hosts \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" and investigates big tech for  the show.  We're grateful he does.  He joins us tonight.</p><p> BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" HOST:  Hey, Tucker.  Good  to be here.  We have been investigating this story over the past few days  now, involving Facebook changes to how they handle news sources in user's  news feed.</p><p> As you mentioned, in a meeting with media company executives from \"The New  York Times\" to News Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News,  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said they will be relying on user surveys to  determine which news sources are \"broadly trusted.\" Now, the comments were made following Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.   That was at the beginning of the month.  And this is one of the many  changes the social media giant has made in an effort to combat fake news,  fake accounts and bots that help amplify and spread fake information.</p><p> Now, I spoke with Facebook earlier today and they assured me that this  isn't an effort to censor any ideas or beliefs and that the random sampling  of trustworthiness happens frequently to ensure sites are getting a fair  shake.</p><p> It works like this.  A user will be presented with a simple yes or no  question about a news site.  Are you familiar with the site?  A \"yes\"  answer brings up the next question to rate it for trustworthiness on a  scale of 1 to 5.</p><p> Now, what about fake accounts boosting the trustworthiness of a not-so- trustworthy news outlet?  Well, Facebook just this year has removed more  than half a billion fake accounts.</p><p> Further, those headlines like \"They pulled over to help this dog, what  happened next will amaze you.\", not going to get the kind of ranking in  your news feed going forward as the changes are also meant to crackdown on  so-called clickbait and focus more on news, especially local news.  </p><p> Now, as for paying providers for that news, no deal.  Cable operators pay  to carry channels like Fox for their customers.  But when asked if Facebook  will do the same thing, the online giant saying, they don't see a need for  that.</p><p> Despite the fact that they're renewing focus on local news, it would seem  that kind of revenue would breathe life into local newspapers and news  outlets that are struggling to remain relevant and profitable in the age of  digital.</p><p> And, Tucker, these changes aren't helping us feel any better.  In this  effort to see more news from friends and less news from media sites, it  actually puts us in a bad mood because we compare ourselves to our friends  and our peers and we see what we are missing out on.  Think parties and  awesome vacations that we are not on.  Tucker?  </p><p> It's what we all want.  We don't want to be informed, we want to feel bad!</p><p> CARLSON:  Maybe we need a vacation from social media.</p><p> LARSON:  I think we all do.</p><p> CARLSON:  I think we do.  Brett, great to see you.</p><p> LARSON:  Thanks, Tucker.  Good to be here.</p><p> CARLSON:  Up next, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" isn't just ruling the airwaves  in other channels, he's also up to new antics online.  We feel obligated to  bring you the latest on that.  Pretty amusing actually.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Sad news tonight.  The \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" seems to be  unstoppable.  He's taken over the 2018 election cycle in two cable news  networks.  He'll be running for president himself before long.</p><p> But like other ominous entities like killer robots to Jeff Bezos, the  \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" needs energy to function and he gets that through  attention and validation until today.</p><p> He posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he ought to keep going on TV or  give people who aren't creepy porn lawyers a chance.  Thousands have voted.   Ninety three percent want him to keep gumming up the air waves.  Doubtless  his act of crass self-validation will keep \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" fully  operational for at least another 36 hours.  Sad news!</p><p> And on that note, thanks for the hour.

And at the end of that period, we have  discovered there is still no evidence at all of collusion between the  Donald Trump for President campaign of 2016 and the Russian government.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Mueller's many supporters in Washington don't seem to care about that.   That's because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously.  The  whole absurd fever dream was always a way for the ruling class to feel  better about losing power in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a way for them to avoid thinking about why Trump got elected.  And  they never have thought about it.</p><p>Along the way, the investigation has provided Democrats with a full year of  government-funded oppo research and destroyed the lives of a number of  people who supported Donald Trump.  There are added bonuses from the  Democratic perspective.</p><p>But there have been downsides for Democrats.  Voters are not impressed by  the Russia story.  It is weird and false and confusing.  It has precisely  nothing to do with voters' actual lives or the issues they vote on.  It is  a total waste of time for everyone.</p><p>And yet, it's all Democrats have.  Trump is evil, so is Russia.  That's the  entire progressive program of 2018 summarized in two sentences.  If the  Democratic Party had a Sermon on the Mount, those would be the attitudes.   No wonder their approval numbers are falling.</p><p>Republican Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana has introduced a resolution  calling for an end to Mueller's investigation or a report within 30 days.   He joins us along with fellow Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida.  He says  he may know the identity of the person who was spied on Trump's campaign  for the FBI in 2016.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome to you both tonight.  Congressman Rokita, first to you,  so this resolution would call for an end to the investigation or a report  summarizing its findings so far.  Am I misstating that?</p><p>REP. TODD ROKITA (R), INDIANA:  No.  Both correct, Tucker.  The fact of the  matter is it's been a year.  As you say, it's been $20 million and we need  to see a report of what evidence he has.  And absent that evidence, it  should wind up within 30 days of the resolution passing.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, why wouldn't other members on both sides in the Congress want  some oversight?  You are constitutionally bound to provide oversight of the  DOJ.  So, why are you the only person calling for this?</p><p>ROKITA:  Well, I'm not.  Matt Gaetz is also calling for it.  There's a  couple other calling for it, but we need your viewers to call your members  of Congress and get them on board.  You can only have a free republic, as  you know, Tucker, if you have transparency.  And this is exactly what we  need.</p><p>It is a witch hunt.  It has gone beyond an investigation.  And the only  evidence of collusion that we found, the only evidence of criminality has  been on the Democrats.</p><p>So, we're calling on Mueller to show his hand or fold the deck.</p><p>CARLSON:  Even if I believed the president colluded with Vladimir Putin,  I'd be very concerned about this investigation because the parameters  aren't clear.  The timeline is opaque.  And it's not clear what the point  is.</p><p>So, Congressman DeSantis, one of the enduring mysteries of the past two  weeks has been the story of a mole or a spy within the Trump campaign  feeding information to the Russia investigation.</p><p>Have you any sense who that person might be?</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Look, I do, Tucker.  But I think that the  issue needs to go through the proper channels.  I'm not comfortable  disclosing who I think it is based on the evidence that I have.</p><p>But I can say this, the American people deserve an answer.  Up or down, did  the FBI direct somebody to spy on Donald Trump's campaign?  Was somebody  actively working to undermine his campaign and create the illusion of  collusion?</p><p>And if that's the case, I think that's more serious than the FISA abuse.  I  think it's more serious than Rosenstein butchering this whole appointing  order with Mueller from the beginning.</p><p>So, we need the answer to those questions.  They are not giving us the  answers right now, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  They are definitely not.  Now, I know you don't want to risk  libel by naming someone because this has not been proved in court, but give  us a sense of what you are talking about.  Are you saying that someone who  worked on the Trump campaign fed information to law enforcement?</p><p>DESANTIS:  So, if you look at Glenn Simpson's testimony from Fusion GPS, he  talked about there being a human source.  And that was something that was  controversial.  Some people said it was Papadopoulos.  That's not what he  was referring to.  </p><p>So, the issue is he acknowledges there's a human source.  Peter Strzok, he  opens up the counterintelligence investigation in the summer of 2016, what  does he do the next day?  He goes to Great Britain, he goes to London and  he's meeting with people.</p><p>Well, how the heck would you do that if you just opened the investigation  that day?  So, I think in that kind of - the London, Christopher Steele,  Glenn Simpson axis is probably the individual that we're looking at.</p><p>But, I mean, look, we need to know whether this individual was spying or  not.  I have great concerns about it, but I think we can get those  questions' answer when the Justice Department ponies up the documents.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, last - you're absolutely right.  The last follow-up on that,  are you suggesting or do you believe that this is someone who was pressured  into cooperating with the investigation or someone who freely sent  information over about the campaign?</p><p>DESANTIS:  I think it's the latter, Tucker.  I think this would be somebody  - potentially could have been paid by the FBI, like Steele.  There was an  agreement to pay Steele.</p><p>We just need an answer to that?  Did they pay anybody?  Yes or no.  Did  they direct anyone to go to the campaign?  Yes or no.  Very easy questions  to answer.</p><p>ROKITA:  And, Tucker, we need the -</p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.  I'm sorry, congressman.  Please go ahead.</p><p>ROKITA:  Yes.  Ron DeSantis is exactly right.  We also need to know the  relationship between Mueller and Comey.  Comey kicked this whole thing off  with a bogus FISA warrant.  And what is the relationship between Mueller  and Comey?  Did Mueller give Comey immunity?  Does Comey think he's about  the law?  Where are we going with all this?  That what needs to be  investigated.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Do believe - quickly, congressman, do you believe that Jim Comey  has been offered immunity by the Mueller investigation?</p><p>ROKITA:  I think it stands to reason.  And I think the American people  deserve to know.</p><p>CARLSON:  That would be shocking.  Congressmen, thank you both.  I  appreciate that.  And I hope you get to the bottom of those.  We have a  right to know.</p><p>ROKITA:  Thanks.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Ted Malloch was an informal advisor to the Donald Trump campaign.   In March, he says he was detained at an airport by investigators for Robert  Mueller who took away his cell phone and asked about his ties to Roger  Stone, among other things.  He is also the author of the book, \"The Plot to  Destroy Trump:  How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to  Subvert the President\".  </p><p>Ted Malloch joins us tonight.  Ted, thank you for coming on.</p><p>TED MALLOCH, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Good evening.</p><p>CARLSON:  When you say you were detained, that's kind of a remarkable  story.  Tell us the circumstances of this.</p><p>MALLOCH:  Especially for a Yale, Oxford and a business school professor to  be stopped at an airport, taken into a room and asked questions by the FBI  and having their phone then under a warrant seized.</p><p>But I write about this in the book as a postscript and my lawyers tell me  not to confirm or deny very much about this because I'm still actively  participating in this conversation.</p><p>CARLSON:  I don't understand.  Why would that put you in legal peril if you  believe the government overstepped and detained you - this is at Logan  Airport in Boston, right?  You're flying in from abroad.  They pull you  aside, take your cell phone and ask you questions.  You have no lawyer  present, is that correct, during this conversation?</p><p>MALLOCH:  None at all.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  So, how - why would you be in jeopardy by exercising your  First Amendment right to explain the truth?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I have explained it as a postscript to the book and actually  detailed it.  And I'm told that the FBI is not all that happy about that  fact.  So, therefore, I'm not really at liberty to say a whole lot more  about where this stands at present.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.  Give us a sense, though.  When you sat down, you had no  lawyer.  It's generally not advised to talk to the FBI without a lawyer.   Did they just grab you as you got off the plane?  And what did you say to  them when they did?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, they had me wait for about 20 minutes, as I say, and then  divided me from my wife and then searched my belongings and took me to a  separate building to introduce me to two FBI agents who asked me a series  of questions.</p><p>Actually, it was quite chit chatty for about 20 minutes.  As a fan of the  Philadelphia Eagles, they asked me what I thought of their victory at the  Super Bowl.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's what they said to Mike Flynn too during his chit chatty  conversation, I'm sure.  </p><p>So, they had a warrant for all of this, I assume.  Is that right?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Correct.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  What did they ask you?</p><p>MALLOCH:  As I said in the postscript, there were very few substantive  questions.  Some about individuals, what my relationship was to the  campaign.  They seem to know all the answers to the questions.</p><p>CARLSON:  Did you consider saying buzz off, I'm not going to answer your  questions?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I think had they gotten any more aggressive, then, in fact, that  would have been the case, but they were fairly benign.  I'm a patriotic  American.  A cold warrior.  I worked in the State Department.  I was the  top American in the UN in Geneva, Switzerland for four years at the end of  the Cold War.</p><p>I'm certainly willing to cooperate in any inquiry.  I don't think I have  much to add.</p><p>CARLSON:  Why do you think they wanted to talk to you?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, my publisher thinks they had pre-read my book on the plot  to destroy the president, which is, in fact, about the conspiracy - the  first in American history since 1783 and the Newburgh conspiracy that tried  to overthrow a sitting president of the United States.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Why did they ask you about Roger Stone?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I have no idea.  I've met Roger Stone three times.  He did write  the foreword to my new book because we had the same publisher.  He gave an  address at Oxford University about 8 or 10 weeks ago and it was a pretty  compelling story about what happened in the 2016 election and we had it  transcribed.  I had attended that lecture.  And we used it as the foreword  to the book.  So, maybe they read more into that than is the case.</p><p>CARLSON:  What did they do to your phone?  You said they had a warrant for  your phone?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Yes.  They confiscated my phone and I'm told it's been returned  to me and I should be receiving it any day.</p><p>CARLSON:  They took your phone away?  How long have they had it?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, since that day, which was before Easter.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'd be pretty annoyed.  Ted, thank you for joining us.  I  appreciate it.</p><p>MALLOCH:  Good to be with you, Tucker.  Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON:  Democratic congressional candidate has expressed his real  thoughts about the NRA in a new ad, which is completely over-the-top.  He  joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, a politician's job is to appeal to voters.  Left-leaning  voters don't like the NRA.  Pat Davis is a Democrat running for Congress in  New Mexico.  Put two and two together and Davis has produced a new ad where  he expresses his view of the NRA unambiguously, but you decide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAT DAVIS (D), NEW MEXICO CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the  NRA.  Their program policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers  and dead fathers.  I'm Pat Davis and I approve this message because if  Congress won't change our gun laws, we are changing Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Pat Davis joins us tonight from New Mexico.  Pat, thanks for  coming on.</p><p>DAVIS:  Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, that's the ad?  Eff the NRA?  Kind of moronic, no?</p><p>DAVIS:  That's it, just 15 seconds, but it got a whole lot of attention and  started a new conversation about guns and I'm grateful for that.</p><p>CARLSON:  But doesn't it degrade you?  You use the F word in an ad.  I  mean, if you have a position, state it, but F the NRA?  I mean, come on.</p><p>DAVIS:  Well, Tucker, being polite, it hasn't made our schools any safer,  it hasn't protected police officers like I used to be.  If a cuss word on  TV offends you more than pictures of dead children in Parkland or Newtown,  then your priorities are all wrong.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's not either/or.  I don't care if you were a cop or not.  Hold  on.  Wait.  Let me ask you a question.  It's not an either/or.  It's not  that I'm so offended.  Politeness doesn't work, do you think rudeness will?   Is rudeness going to save lives, do you think?</p><p>DAVIS:  As we were looking to make this ad, we kept coming up with the same  idea.  And every ad idea we came up to talk about this issue looked like  somebody else's.  And those had not worked.</p><p>Clearly, this got the NRA's attention and it has started a new conversation  both amongst candidates running for office, about how we organize and take  back Congress and put new leaders there to take on control, but also how we  stand up to the NRA.</p><p>We know what works.  Fifty percent of NRA members support - </p><p>CARLSON:  No, it started a conversation about how embarrassing you are.   How many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p>DAVIS:  Well - but, Tucker, here's the thing.  A majority of Americans - 89  percent of police officers, a majority of NRA members know there are common  sense things we can do.</p><p>CARLSON:  Hold on.  Slow down.  You just released an ad that said F the  NRA, which I'm sure back at your fraternity house they love.  But let me  ask you an adult question, how many NRA members have committed mass  shootings?</p><p>DAVIS:  Tucker, this is about the organization itself.  My family grew up,  when I was growing up - </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm asking you about the organization itself.</p><p>DAVIS:  It's not the NRA of my dad's organization.</p><p>CARLSON:  F the NRA.  But how many of their members - hold on.  They have  millions of members.  How many of them - </p><p>DAVIS:  They do.  And I've been hearing from them all week.  I've been  hearing from them all week because the NRA made us their target.</p><p>We've started a new conversation and what I've also heard from are parents  in Parkland, in Virginia, in Newtown who donated to keep the ad on the air  because they want people in Congress to finally step up.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.  So, you're really doing a public service.</p><p>DAVIS:  If the NRA wants to come to the table and help us pass common sense  regulations that their members support, let's do it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Come to the table?  You just said F the NRA.</p><p>DAVIS:  We are not waiting on them to come to the table.</p><p>CARLSON:  You're really trying to have an adult conversation.  So, here is  your new spot.  And I want to talk to policy and see what you know about  it.  So, here's your latest 15-second ad.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVIS:  By the time this ad is done, an AR-15 could have fired 150 bullets.   That's why we need to ban assault weapons.  I'm Pat Davis, running for  Congress.  And I approve this message because lives are more important than  gun company profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you just said that in 15 seconds an AR-15 can fire 150  rounds.  Is that true?</p><p>DAVIS:  That's right.  You get it right here in New Mexico.  Right here in  New Mexico, you can go to a parking lot or go on the Internet, buy an  assault weapon, an AR-15 and buy a legally available add-on like a bump  stock that allows you to replicate exactly what happened in Las Vegas.</p><p>The Las Vegas shooter could shoot 600 rounds a minute.</p><p>CARLSON:  You are saying an AR-15 can shoot 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  So,  would it have a 150-round magazine?  What would that - let me ask - let's  be specific about your ad.  What would that magazine look like, the 150- round magazine?</p><p>DAVIS:  Exactly like the magazines the Las Vegas police officers pulled out  of that hotel room.  They had 50 and 100-round magazines and that weapon  was capable -</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you could fire - it is physically possible to fire - it's  not.  I mean, these are rhetorical questions.  You don't know what you're  talking about.  I know that you are a police officer.  Or you claim to have  been.</p><p>DAVIS:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  No AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  That's untrue.  And  if you believe it is true, then you are not qualified to have a  conversation about guns.  People are laughing at you because you are  ignorant.  You don't know what you're talking about.  No, no, that's just  untrue.</p><p>DAVIS:  We take exactly the word of the police officers in Las Vegas who I  trust who ran into that room to save people down below and found a weapon  that was modified with bump stocks.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, so they say an AR-15 - what do you think would happen to the  barrel in 15 seconds if you put 150 rounds?  It would melt.</p><p>DAVIS:  I know they get hot.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, my point is if you're going to take on the NRA and be Mr.  Tough, I was a cop guy, maybe you should know what you're talking about,  but you don't.</p><p>You are putting something on television that's demonstrably wrong, that's  physically possible, and all of your voters are like, oh, yes, this guy  knows what he's talking about, he was a cop, but you don't know.  So, maybe  you should apologize for it.</p><p>DAVIS:  I'm not apologizing for taking on the NRA.  I know why I'm pursuing  it.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'm sorry.  Politeness doesn't work.  I'm just trying to - oh,  OK.</p><p>I think you should apologize for saying something that's factually untrue.</p><p>DAVIS:  Apologies and politeness have not changed the conversation.  We  need new focus to take over and decide.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, that's why I'm not being polite.  I'm trying to get a real  conversation going here.  But you don't know what you're talking about, so  maybe you shouldn't be in a position to make decisions because you don't  understand the issue because you just told me with a straight face that an  AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  Oh, surprise.  It can't.</p><p>So, maybe you should admit that and move on to something you understand.   Would you do that?</p><p>DAVIS:  This is exactly the type of arguments that don't get us where we  need to be.  We need new leadership in Congress.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, it's not like, F the NRA.  That's the kind of argument we  need.  I thought politeness didn't work, tough guy?</p><p>DAVIS:  Politeness is not working so far.  If you woke up on Mother's Day  and you don't have your kid anymore -</p><p>CARLSON:  You know what works actually?  Facts work.  Why don't you get  some facts?  Oh, Pat, do you like this new mode of communication we have?   F the NRA, Pat.</p><p>DAVIS:  It would be great to have a conversation.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Learn something about funs and get back to me.  Interview over.   Yes, because you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p>Let's go back to politeness.  I like it better.  It's another primary night  and a Democrat who sounds like Donald Trump could be a winner tonight.   Amazing! He will join us.</p><p>Plus, Brit Hume joins us to break down the Democrats' 2018 message or lack  thereof.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  This is a Fox News alert.  Primary elections held tonight in the  State of Pennsylvania, polling places just closed.  A court there has  radically reshaped the state's congressional boundaries.</p><p>John Morganelli is a Democrat running for Congress in the newly reshaped  7th district in the state's northeast.  The district only narrowly  supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>And despite his party affiliation, Morganelli is anti-abortion and has  called for some restrictions on immigration and sanctuary cities.  Mr.  Morganelli joins us tonight.  Mr. Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOHN MORGANELLI, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Tucker, thanks for  having me tonight.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, as I understand, there are three candidates, Democratic  candidates, running in this primary tonight.  Polls have closed.  So, we  are not affecting anything with his interview.</p><p>But the three candidates each come from a different strain of the  Democratic Party ideologically.  Describe the kind of Democrat that you  are.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Well, Tucker, I've come out of a blue-collar background.  My  father was a construction worker with a sixth-grade education.  My mother  was a seamstress with 11th grade education.</p><p>And I believe that I've come out of the sort of the traditional Democratic  Party that's concerned about working men and women, that's concerned about  the blue-collar issues that affect these folks and I have always believed  the John F.  Kennedy model and, even to some degree, the Bill Clinton  model, who ran as a centrist.  And that's pretty much where I have been.   I'm not the strain of Democratic Party.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, I'm fascinated by the news coverage of your race.  So, you've  said things that don't seem very controversial, like you are not in favor  of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.  You are not against all  immigration, but you're worried about illegal immigration.  And you're not  for giving state-subsidized tuition to illegal immigrants.</p><p>For this, you are described as a hard-liner on immigration.  Do you think  that's fair?  Do you think the coverage of that subject is fair?</p><p>MORGANELLI:  No, I don't think it's fair.  First of all, I'm a grandson of  an Italian immigrant and I believe immigration is great.  It's made our  country great.</p><p>But immigration is a process.  There is laws that we have and people have  to get in line and come into the country in a legal way.  And to describe  me as a hard-liner, I think, is not accurate.  </p><p>I go to the naturalization service that we have in our county where people  from all over the world become naturalized citizens.  It's a wonderful  ceremony in the courthouse.  And those are immigrants.</p><p>What I'm opposed to is just people breaking into our country without  permission.  Some of them being criminals, and I've seen them in my own  county from the MS-13 gang and others.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  And then, our country giving incentives for more illegal  immigration such as driver's license and state tuition, I don't think those  incentives should be given.  It just creates more illegal immigration.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, Bill Clinton said that exact same thing 20 years ago.  Now,  you are one of only a couple Democrats willing to say that out loud.  What  happened to the Democratic Party?</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Well, it's interesting.  As you know, there is a picture - a  video of President Clinton giving, I think, a State of the Union speech  where he talks hard-line on immigration.  He says everything that I believe  in.  And even President Obama gave a similar speech.  So, this is not out  of step with Democrats.</p><p>I mean, in my own community here, I have great support for this position.   People here, Democratic voters, I don't think - I guess we'll know better  tonight - want foreign criminals coming into the county and setting up  shop.</p><p>They don't want sanctuary cities.  I have opposed sanctuary cities for a  long, long time.  Having a sanctuary city is like putting up a big sign  that says, please, all foreign criminals, come here because we won't do  anything about it if you commit a crime.</p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  So, I don't think that all Democrats are in lockstep  necessarily with some of the national philosophy that comes out of  Washington on this issue.</p><p>CARLSON:  Man, I hope you are right.  And the polls have closed, so I can  say that I'm certainly rooting for you tonight.  John Morganelli, thanks a  lot for coming on.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Thank you.  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Probably won't help.  Well, with some candidates on the  Democratic side flipping the bird to the NRA, while others back Trump-style  immigration, it's not quite clear what the Democratic message is for 2018.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst.  He watches carefully.  He  joins us tonight.  Brit, what do you think the message is?  Or is there a  national message that the Democratic Party is selling this midterm?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it's pretty  indistinct at this moment, if there is one, Tucker.  I think that much of  the party is so mesmerized by Donald Trump and loathes him so deeply that  that has become kind of the central thing and the central theme that you  can see with the Democratic - that's what the Democratic Party appears to  be mostly about right now.  I suspect, as time goes on, something more  oriented towards voters will come along.</p><p>But, remember, Tucker, these candidates are running in a party where 71  percent, according to one recent poll, want Donald Trump impeached.  So,  it's kind of understandable that there would be some focus on him.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  For sure.  Most Democrats are, of course, very anti-Trump.   That's why they are Democrats.  But is that a message that moves people to  the polls?</p><p>HUME:  Well, based on the evidence we have, it seems not to be working very  well.  And the reason I say that is, look at the advantages that Democrats  enjoy going into this midterm election.</p><p>First of all, the political gravity in any president's first midterm is  always with the other party and the average loss is more than would be  enough - if they made their average again, the Democrats would get control  of the House.</p><p>Now, they had a huge gap in what's called the generic ballot.  You know,  Tucker, that's the one where you ask people if they'd rather vote for a  Democrat or Republican unnamed in the upcoming election.</p><p>Normally, Democrats do well on that ballot.  They were up plus 15 or 16 at  one point not very long ago.  And now, that number is down to single  digits.  And some polls down to low single digits which suggest that  whatever they are selling, people are not buying with the enthusiasm that  the party had hoped for.</p><p>CARLSON:  What will happen if they don't retake the House?</p><p>HUME:  Well, I think there will be an agonizing reappraisal because we've  been hearing about this blue wave that was thought to be inevitable, and  may yet come.</p><p>If it doesn't come, obviously, there's going to be a search for scapegoats.   And we will see what happens.</p><p>But this party, I think, Tucker, what we're seeing emerge now is that for  all the divisions in the Republican Party between Trump supporters and the  never Trumpers and so on and all the divisions within the conservative  movement over that, the divisions in the Democratic Party are at least as  deep, if not deeper.  </p><p>And at the heart of the Democratic Party - I remember you saying in a  speech not too many years ago - was not with Hillary Clinton, but she won  anyway.</p><p>A candidate of her stripe, I don't think, could win this time.  I don't  know that a white male candidate could win.</p><p>So, here we are, the Democrats really have some serious divisions to worry  about.  And whether whatever they come up with will be appealing to a broad  cross section of voters is, obviously, what remains to be seen.</p><p>CARLSON:  A white male candidate could not win.  I don't think a lot of the  white male candidates running for the Democratic nomination know that yet,  but I think they're going to learn.</p><p>And do you think that it moves in the direction of populist economics,  become the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders party?</p><p>HUME:  Well, I think that's the drift.  And I think that excites a lot of  people.  And, of course, if you look at the attitudes of young voters now,  who do not seem to have grasped the benefits of a market capitalist economy  and don't seem to be put off at all about the idea of socialism despite  socialism's abysmal history, which is playing out even today in certain  parts of the world, Venezuela being the most conspicuous example, but I  think the party - it's gotten pretty far left now.  And a lot of old ideas  that are being passed off as kind of new ideas are in the air.</p><p>And the party will have to reckon with that because if they come up with  somebody who is an out and out socialist for president, I don't think they  could possibly win.  And I'm not sure how many of them we'll see, but there  will be awful battles over this.</p><p>CARLSON:  Their corporate donors, because the party is entirely supported  by corporate America, are going to pretty surprised when it turns out  they're sending money to Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>HUME:  No, I was just going to say don't underestimate the ability of a  leftist candidate to raise money from small donations and make a serious  run for it.  Bernie Sanders certainly did.</p><p>CARLSON:  No, that's right.  I just think that Goldman Sachs guys are going  to be pretty shocked when they see what's coming.  Great to see you.</p><p>HUME:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, an embattled minority group is under attack in South Africa  and on the receiving end of genocidal rhetoric.  It is considered  unacceptable to talk about this in the media in the West for some reason,  but we don't care because it's true and it's happening and it's news and we  are covering it.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, now to a fascinating and significant story the media have  all but ignored.  South Africa is a diverse country, but the South African  government would like to make it much less diverse.</p><p>An embattled minority of farmers, mostly Afrikaans speaking, is being  targeted in a wave of barbaric and horrifying murders.</p><p>But instead of protecting them, the government just passed a law allowing  it to seize their farms without any compensation based purely on their  ethnicity and distribute those farms to more favored groups.</p><p>Thousands have already migrated out of the country, but they've struggled  to attract any sympathy abroad for some reason.</p><p>Ernst Roets is deputy CEO of AfriForum.  It's a South Africa civil rights  group.  He was just in the United States to meet with a number of  government officials.  He also took a moment to talk to us.  Here's part of  what he said.</p><p>Ernst Roets joins us now.  Mr. Roets, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ERNST ROETS, SOUTH AFRICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Thank you very much.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you describe in this book a disorganized, but in some sense  intentional campaign to crush a racial minority within your country and the  government seems onboard with it.  Is that an overstatement?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, what the book is about is it's about government complicity in  the scourge of farm attacks and farm murders that we've seen in South  Africa.</p><p>So, in only the last two decades, there's been - according to government  statistics, which we believe - we have reason to say that it's maybe  downplayed a little.  There's been about two farm attacks every day and two  farm murders every week in South Africa.</p><p>And in the book, I highlight actually ten different reasons why we believe  the South African government is complicit.  And it stretches from reasons  including - the fact that as these attacks have worsened - for example, in  2007, there was a 25 percent increase in these attacks and then the South  African government responded saying we're not going to release any more  statistics about this.</p><p>Then also, which is very concerning, is the hate speech in South Africa.   That's the title of the book as well, \"Kill the Boer\", which is a very  popular song which is still being sung in South Africa.  It was sung just  the other day.  So, it's sung at political rallies.</p><p>And, of course, Boer referring to a particular cultural group in South  Africa.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>ROETS:  We have songs like \"Shoot the Boer\", which is a different song.   There are a variety of ways in which - </p><p>CARLSON:  But I thought that hate speech was now a crime punishable by  prison time in South Africa.  Are any of the people who say this arrested?</p><p>ROETS:  There's a bill on the table to have hate speech declared a crime  punishable by prison time.  But if you look at the motivation around it,  it's very clear that - I think those in government who are pushing this  don't regard this as hate speech.</p><p>As a matter of fact, they've been arguing that it's not hate speech in  court.  So, they would argue that they have a right to sing about killing  farmers and then they would say it's an expression of freedom of speech.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, now the government has announced that it plans to pursue a  policy of taking land away from people on the basis of their skin color.   Do you think they'll do that?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, that's what was adopted in our parliament in February.  A  motion was adopted that the property rights clause in the South African  constitution has to be changed to allow for expropriation of private  property without compensation.</p><p>So, the state president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that this would turn South  Africa into the ultimate paradise and the Garden of Eden and Deputy  President David Mabuza even went further saying that - basically  threatening white farmers that if they do not voluntarily hand over their  land to black people, then there would be a violent takeover.  So, the  situation is very dire in South Africa.</p><p>But the good news is that there is still a process that has to be followed  and that's why we are in the United States.</p><p>CARLSON:  What I find so striking is the response from everyone else around  the world.  It's almost never covered in the American media.  There is a  sense that the people being murdered deserve it because of what their  ancestors did.  And the international community is similarly silent.</p><p>Have you met with any government officials here in Washington about what's  happening in your country?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, that's why we are here.  We are about to meet with some  government officials and it's very unfortunate, the situation that you've  just mentioned.</p><p>Especially in South Africa, there's a hierarchy of recognition.  So, some  people, when they are the victims, it's all over the news and you hear  about it frequently.  And other people, especially farmers in South Africa,  white farmers in particular, they would be tortured to death and it would  receive very little news coverage.</p><p>And that's unfortunately the situation abroad as well, which is why we are  very grateful to be having this.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, a government official in Australia said publicly maybe we  ought to allow asylum to people being persecuted for their skin color in  your country and he was basically laughed at and then attacked by your  government for saying that.</p><p>ROETS:  Yes, he was attacked.  And they then said that he shouldn't say  that because AfriForum was providing them with false information.  Well,  the information that we're quoting is government statistics.</p><p>So, that is the situation.  Whoever speaks out against this - we, just for  being in the United States, we've been accused of treason, we've had people  threatening us, saying they will wait for us at the airport when we come  back and they'll attack us and so forth.  We had the state president today  in parliament calling on us to go back to South Africa.</p><p>So, whenever you speak out against this, there is a very serious backlash.</p><p>CARLSON:  This is not what Nelson Mandela wanted.</p><p>ROETS:  No, it's the exact opposite than what he wanted.  He spoke about a  free country in which people were not judged by the color of their skin.   And he even wanted farm attacks to be a priority crime.</p><p>He said that when he was president.  And when his presidency was over, they  deprioritized it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, you just watch something like this happen in a neighboring  country, Zimbabwe, which went from being one of the richest in Africa to  the poorest in the world because of farm attacks and because of the theft  of private property, is the ANC, the ruling party in South Africa, aware of  that lesson?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, they are, but you know that saying real communism has never  been tried.  That's what they keep saying.  So, it failed in Zimbabwe.  It  failed in Cuba.  It failed in Venezuela.  It failed in Russia.  It failed  in China.  All of those countries.</p><p>And they are basically saying that we're going to try the same thing, but  this time it's going to work.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, last question.  It's considered basically immoral in the  United States to talk to you or to hear stories like this for reasons that  nobody ever bothers really to explain, but it's just understood.</p><p>If you could speak to our media, to the people who are dismissing your  claims as false, what would you say?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, I think there are three things.  Firstly, everything we say  is fact based.  It's based on research.  But in terms of what we hope to  achieve and what people can do, people who want to invest in South Africa,  we want them to call on the South African government to say, listen, you  are calling on us to invest in your country, but you want to expropriate  those investments.</p><p>Number two, we are speaking with the US government and asking them to put  pressure on the South African government, which could be done in a variety  of ways.</p><p>And number three, members of the public and members of the media, the best  thing that you can do to help us is to talk about this, to talk about it on  public platforms and in that way to continue to put pressure on the South  African government not to continue with this policy.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Just to tell the truth.  I agree.  Mr. Roets, thank you.</p><p>ROETS:  Thanks very much.  Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON:  Tech companies are getting more powerful, even as we sleep.   Facebook has a plan for ranking news outlets by how trustworthy it says  they are, while Twitter plans to just censor certain views entirely.  A  brave new world has arrived.  Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to fund  terrorists in Somalia.  That's according to a new report by a Fox affiliate  in the twin cities.</p><p>According to that story, many members of Minnesota's Somali immigrant  community have discovered they can open sham day care centers that only  pretend to watch children, collect a fat subsidy from the state for doing  that and keep the change.  They have made millions of dollars, up to 100  million according to that report.  That would be half of Minnesota's annual  budget for child care assistance.</p><p>Again, these are people who are resettled here as an act of charity by our  country, accused now of defrauding our country.  And not just fraud, fraud  so brazen, the report says, that Somalis buy shares in fake day care  outlets to get a cut of it.</p><p>Some of this fraudulently obtained money is reportedly being shipped back  to Somalia in suitcases full of cash to evade federal wire transfer  restrictions.</p><p>Some of this money is ending up in regions of Somalia controlled by the  Islamic terror group, Al-Shabab.</p><p>Well, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is outraged by the  story.  It's not the fraud that makes him mad or the ingratitude or the  injustice.  It was that it was exposed at all.  That offended him.</p><p>In a statement, he denounced the new report on the grounds that it could  hinder further cash transfers to Somalia, which apparently he cares more  about than America, which he's supposed be representing.</p><p>According to Congressman Ellison, briefcases of untraceable cash in Somalia  hurt Al-Shabab rather than helping them somehow.</p><p>Well, apparently, it's not enough for the tech companies to know what you  do, and they do know what you do, increasingly they want to control what  you do and what you see and what you think.</p><p>During a recent meeting with investors, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  revealed that his company has been ranking news outlets by how trustworthy  they are, with less trusted outlets being penalized on Facebook's news  feed.  Trusted, by the way, by Facebook, not by you, but by Mark Zuckerberg  and his deputies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter is implementing a system to suppress tweets it regards  as harassment, even if those tweets actually break no rules.  In other  words, if Twitter disagrees with the political orientation of the tweets.</p><p>Brett Larson hosts \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" and investigates big tech for  the show.  We're grateful he does.  He joins us tonight.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" HOST:  Hey, Tucker.  Good  to be here.  We have been investigating this story over the past few days  now, involving Facebook changes to how they handle news sources in user's  news feed.</p><p>As you mentioned, in a meeting with media company executives from \"The New  York Times\" to News Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News,  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said they will be relying on user surveys to  determine which news sources are \"broadly trusted.\" Now, the comments were made following Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.   That was at the beginning of the month.  And this is one of the many  changes the social media giant has made in an effort to combat fake news,  fake accounts and bots that help amplify and spread fake information.</p><p>Now, I spoke with Facebook earlier today and they assured me that this  isn't an effort to censor any ideas or beliefs and that the random sampling  of trustworthiness happens frequently to ensure sites are getting a fair  shake.</p><p>It works like this.  A user will be presented with a simple yes or no  question about a news site.  Are you familiar with the site?  A \"yes\"  answer brings up the next question to rate it for trustworthiness on a  scale of 1 to 5.</p><p>Now, what about fake accounts boosting the trustworthiness of a not-so- trustworthy news outlet?  Well, Facebook just this year has removed more  than half a billion fake accounts.</p><p>Further, those headlines like \"They pulled over to help this dog, what  happened next will amaze you.\", not going to get the kind of ranking in  your news feed going forward as the changes are also meant to crackdown on  so-called clickbait and focus more on news, especially local news.  </p><p>Now, as for paying providers for that news, no deal.  Cable operators pay  to carry channels like Fox for their customers.  But when asked if Facebook  will do the same thing, the online giant saying, they don't see a need for  that.</p><p>Despite the fact that they're renewing focus on local news, it would seem  that kind of revenue would breathe life into local newspapers and news  outlets that are struggling to remain relevant and profitable in the age of  digital.</p><p>And, Tucker, these changes aren't helping us feel any better.  In this  effort to see more news from friends and less news from media sites, it  actually puts us in a bad mood because we compare ourselves to our friends  and our peers and we see what we are missing out on.  Think parties and  awesome vacations that we are not on.  Tucker?  </p><p>It's what we all want.  We don't want to be informed, we want to feel bad!</p><p>CARLSON:  Maybe we need a vacation from social media.</p><p>LARSON:  I think we all do.</p><p>CARLSON:  I think we do.  Brett, great to see you.</p><p>LARSON:  Thanks, Tucker.  Good to be here.</p><p>CARLSON:  Up next, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" isn't just ruling the airwaves  in other channels, he's also up to new antics online.  We feel obligated to  bring you the latest on that.  Pretty amusing actually.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Sad news tonight.  The \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" seems to be  unstoppable.  He's taken over the 2018 election cycle in two cable news  networks.  He'll be running for president himself before long.</p><p>But like other ominous entities like killer robots to Jeff Bezos, the  \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" needs energy to function and he gets that through  attention and validation until today.</p><p>He posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he ought to keep going on TV or  give people who aren't creepy porn lawyers a chance.  Thousands have voted.   Ninety three percent want him to keep gumming up the air waves.  Doubtless  his act of crass self-validation will keep \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" fully  operational for at least another 36 hours.  Sad news!</p><p>And on that note, thanks for the hour.  Sean Hannity is next from New York.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And at the end of that period, we have  discovered there is still no evidence at all of collusion between the  Donald Trump for President campaign of 2016 and the Russian government.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Mueller's many supporters in Washington don't seem to care about that.   That's because the investigation was never about Russia, obviously.  The  whole absurd fever dream was always a way for the ruling class to feel  better about losing power in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a way for them to avoid thinking about why Trump got elected.  And  they never have thought about it.</p><p>Along the way, the investigation has provided Democrats with a full year of  government-funded oppo research and destroyed the lives of a number of  people who supported Donald Trump.  There are added bonuses from the  Democratic perspective.</p><p>But there have been downsides for Democrats.  Voters are not impressed by  the Russia story.  It is weird and false and confusing.  It has precisely  nothing to do with voters' actual lives or the issues they vote on.  It is  a total waste of time for everyone.</p><p>And yet, it's all Democrats have.  Trump is evil, so is Russia.  That's the  entire progressive program of 2018 summarized in two sentences.  If the  Democratic Party had a Sermon on the Mount, those would be the attitudes.   No wonder their approval numbers are falling.</p><p>Republican Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana has introduced a resolution  calling for an end to Mueller's investigation or a report within 30 days.   He joins us along with fellow Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida.  He says  he may know the identity of the person who was spied on Trump's campaign  for the FBI in 2016.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome to you both tonight.  Congressman Rokita, first to you,  so this resolution would call for an end to the investigation or a report  summarizing its findings so far.  Am I misstating that?</p><p>REP. TODD ROKITA (R), INDIANA:  No.  Both correct, Tucker.  The fact of the  matter is it's been a year.  As you say, it's been $20 million and we need  to see a report of what evidence he has.  And absent that evidence, it  should wind up within 30 days of the resolution passing.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, why wouldn't other members on both sides in the Congress want  some oversight?  You are constitutionally bound to provide oversight of the  DOJ.  So, why are you the only person calling for this?</p><p>ROKITA:  Well, I'm not.  Matt Gaetz is also calling for it.  There's a  couple other calling for it, but we need your viewers to call your members  of Congress and get them on board.  You can only have a free republic, as  you know, Tucker, if you have transparency.  And this is exactly what we  need.</p><p>It is a witch hunt.  It has gone beyond an investigation.  And the only  evidence of collusion that we found, the only evidence of criminality has  been on the Democrats.</p><p>So, we're calling on Mueller to show his hand or fold the deck.</p><p>CARLSON:  Even if I believed the president colluded with Vladimir Putin,  I'd be very concerned about this investigation because the parameters  aren't clear.  The timeline is opaque.  And it's not clear what the point  is.</p><p>So, Congressman DeSantis, one of the enduring mysteries of the past two  weeks has been the story of a mole or a spy within the Trump campaign  feeding information to the Russia investigation.</p><p>Have you any sense who that person might be?</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Look, I do, Tucker.  But I think that the  issue needs to go through the proper channels.  I'm not comfortable  disclosing who I think it is based on the evidence that I have.</p><p>But I can say this, the American people deserve an answer.  Up or down, did  the FBI direct somebody to spy on Donald Trump's campaign?  Was somebody  actively working to undermine his campaign and create the illusion of  collusion?</p><p>And if that's the case, I think that's more serious than the FISA abuse.  I  think it's more serious than Rosenstein butchering this whole appointing  order with Mueller from the beginning.</p><p>So, we need the answer to those questions.  They are not giving us the  answers right now, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  They are definitely not.  Now, I know you don't want to risk  libel by naming someone because this has not been proved in court, but give  us a sense of what you are talking about.  Are you saying that someone who  worked on the Trump campaign fed information to law enforcement?</p><p>DESANTIS:  So, if you look at Glenn Simpson's testimony from Fusion GPS, he  talked about there being a human source.  And that was something that was  controversial.  Some people said it was Papadopoulos.  That's not what he  was referring to.  </p><p>So, the issue is he acknowledges there's a human source.  Peter Strzok, he  opens up the counterintelligence investigation in the summer of 2016, what  does he do the next day?  He goes to Great Britain, he goes to London and  he's meeting with people.</p><p>Well, how the heck would you do that if you just opened the investigation  that day?  So, I think in that kind of - the London, Christopher Steele,  Glenn Simpson axis is probably the individual that we're looking at.</p><p>But, I mean, look, we need to know whether this individual was spying or  not.  I have great concerns about it, but I think we can get those  questions' answer when the Justice Department ponies up the documents.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, last - you're absolutely right.  The last follow-up on that,  are you suggesting or do you believe that this is someone who was pressured  into cooperating with the investigation or someone who freely sent  information over about the campaign?</p><p>DESANTIS:  I think it's the latter, Tucker.  I think this would be somebody  - potentially could have been paid by the FBI, like Steele.  There was an  agreement to pay Steele.</p><p>We just need an answer to that?  Did they pay anybody?  Yes or no.  Did  they direct anyone to go to the campaign?  Yes or no.  Very easy questions  to answer.</p><p>ROKITA:  And, Tucker, we need the -</p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.  I'm sorry, congressman.  Please go ahead.</p><p>ROKITA:  Yes.  Ron DeSantis is exactly right.  We also need to know the  relationship between Mueller and Comey.  Comey kicked this whole thing off  with a bogus FISA warrant.  And what is the relationship between Mueller  and Comey?  Did Mueller give Comey immunity?  Does Comey think he's about  the law?  Where are we going with all this?  That what needs to be  investigated.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Do believe - quickly, congressman, do you believe that Jim Comey  has been offered immunity by the Mueller investigation?</p><p>ROKITA:  I think it stands to reason.  And I think the American people  deserve to know.</p><p>CARLSON:  That would be shocking.  Congressmen, thank you both.  I  appreciate that.  And I hope you get to the bottom of those.  We have a  right to know.</p><p>ROKITA:  Thanks.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Ted Malloch was an informal advisor to the Donald Trump campaign.   In March, he says he was detained at an airport by investigators for Robert  Mueller who took away his cell phone and asked about his ties to Roger  Stone, among other things.  He is also the author of the book, \"The Plot to  Destroy Trump:  How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to  Subvert the President\".  </p><p>Ted Malloch joins us tonight.  Ted, thank you for coming on.</p><p>TED MALLOCH, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER:  Good evening.</p><p>CARLSON:  When you say you were detained, that's kind of a remarkable  story.  Tell us the circumstances of this.</p><p>MALLOCH:  Especially for a Yale, Oxford and a business school professor to  be stopped at an airport, taken into a room and asked questions by the FBI  and having their phone then under a warrant seized.</p><p>But I write about this in the book as a postscript and my lawyers tell me  not to confirm or deny very much about this because I'm still actively  participating in this conversation.</p><p>CARLSON:  I don't understand.  Why would that put you in legal peril if you  believe the government overstepped and detained you - this is at Logan  Airport in Boston, right?  You're flying in from abroad.  They pull you  aside, take your cell phone and ask you questions.  You have no lawyer  present, is that correct, during this conversation?</p><p>MALLOCH:  None at all.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  So, how - why would you be in jeopardy by exercising your  First Amendment right to explain the truth?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I have explained it as a postscript to the book and actually  detailed it.  And I'm told that the FBI is not all that happy about that  fact.  So, therefore, I'm not really at liberty to say a whole lot more  about where this stands at present.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.  Give us a sense, though.  When you sat down, you had no  lawyer.  It's generally not advised to talk to the FBI without a lawyer.   Did they just grab you as you got off the plane?  And what did you say to  them when they did?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, they had me wait for about 20 minutes, as I say, and then  divided me from my wife and then searched my belongings and took me to a  separate building to introduce me to two FBI agents who asked me a series  of questions.</p><p>Actually, it was quite chit chatty for about 20 minutes.  As a fan of the  Philadelphia Eagles, they asked me what I thought of their victory at the  Super Bowl.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's what they said to Mike Flynn too during his chit chatty  conversation, I'm sure.  </p><p>So, they had a warrant for all of this, I assume.  Is that right?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Correct.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  What did they ask you?</p><p>MALLOCH:  As I said in the postscript, there were very few substantive  questions.  Some about individuals, what my relationship was to the  campaign.  They seem to know all the answers to the questions.</p><p>CARLSON:  Did you consider saying buzz off, I'm not going to answer your  questions?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I think had they gotten any more aggressive, then, in fact, that  would have been the case, but they were fairly benign.  I'm a patriotic  American.  A cold warrior.  I worked in the State Department.  I was the  top American in the UN in Geneva, Switzerland for four years at the end of  the Cold War.</p><p>I'm certainly willing to cooperate in any inquiry.  I don't think I have  much to add.</p><p>CARLSON:  Why do you think they wanted to talk to you?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, my publisher thinks they had pre-read my book on the plot  to destroy the president, which is, in fact, about the conspiracy - the  first in American history since 1783 and the Newburgh conspiracy that tried  to overthrow a sitting president of the United States.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Why did they ask you about Roger Stone?</p><p>MALLOCH:  I have no idea.  I've met Roger Stone three times.  He did write  the foreword to my new book because we had the same publisher.  He gave an  address at Oxford University about 8 or 10 weeks ago and it was a pretty  compelling story about what happened in the 2016 election and we had it  transcribed.  I had attended that lecture.  And we used it as the foreword  to the book.  So, maybe they read more into that than is the case.</p><p>CARLSON:  What did they do to your phone?  You said they had a warrant for  your phone?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Yes.  They confiscated my phone and I'm told it's been returned  to me and I should be receiving it any day.</p><p>CARLSON:  They took your phone away?  How long have they had it?</p><p>MALLOCH:  Well, since that day, which was before Easter.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'd be pretty annoyed.  Ted, thank you for joining us.  I  appreciate it.</p><p>MALLOCH:  Good to be with you, Tucker.  Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON:  Democratic congressional candidate has expressed his real  thoughts about the NRA in a new ad, which is completely over-the-top.  He  joins us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, a politician's job is to appeal to voters.  Left-leaning  voters don't like the NRA.  Pat Davis is a Democrat running for Congress in  New Mexico.  Put two and two together and Davis has produced a new ad where  he expresses his view of the NRA unambiguously, but you decide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAT DAVIS (D), NEW MEXICO CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  (EXPLETIVE DELETED) the  NRA.  Their program policies have resulted in dead children, dead mothers  and dead fathers.  I'm Pat Davis and I approve this message because if  Congress won't change our gun laws, we are changing Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Pat Davis joins us tonight from New Mexico.  Pat, thanks for  coming on.</p><p>DAVIS:  Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, that's the ad?  Eff the NRA?  Kind of moronic, no?</p><p>DAVIS:  That's it, just 15 seconds, but it got a whole lot of attention and  started a new conversation about guns and I'm grateful for that.</p><p>CARLSON:  But doesn't it degrade you?  You use the F word in an ad.  I  mean, if you have a position, state it, but F the NRA?  I mean, come on.</p><p>DAVIS:  Well, Tucker, being polite, it hasn't made our schools any safer,  it hasn't protected police officers like I used to be.  If a cuss word on  TV offends you more than pictures of dead children in Parkland or Newtown,  then your priorities are all wrong.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's not either/or.  I don't care if you were a cop or not.  Hold  on.  Wait.  Let me ask you a question.  It's not an either/or.  It's not  that I'm so offended.  Politeness doesn't work, do you think rudeness will?   Is rudeness going to save lives, do you think?</p><p>DAVIS:  As we were looking to make this ad, we kept coming up with the same  idea.  And every ad idea we came up to talk about this issue looked like  somebody else's.  And those had not worked.</p><p>Clearly, this got the NRA's attention and it has started a new conversation  both amongst candidates running for office, about how we organize and take  back Congress and put new leaders there to take on control, but also how we  stand up to the NRA.</p><p>We know what works.  Fifty percent of NRA members support - </p><p>CARLSON:  No, it started a conversation about how embarrassing you are.   How many NRA members have committed mass shootings?</p><p>DAVIS:  Well - but, Tucker, here's the thing.  A majority of Americans - 89  percent of police officers, a majority of NRA members know there are common  sense things we can do.</p><p>CARLSON:  Hold on.  Slow down.  You just released an ad that said F the  NRA, which I'm sure back at your fraternity house they love.  But let me  ask you an adult question, how many NRA members have committed mass  shootings?</p><p>DAVIS:  Tucker, this is about the organization itself.  My family grew up,  when I was growing up - </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm asking you about the organization itself.</p><p>DAVIS:  It's not the NRA of my dad's organization.</p><p>CARLSON:  F the NRA.  But how many of their members - hold on.  They have  millions of members.  How many of them - </p><p>DAVIS:  They do.  And I've been hearing from them all week.  I've been  hearing from them all week because the NRA made us their target.</p><p>We've started a new conversation and what I've also heard from are parents  in Parkland, in Virginia, in Newtown who donated to keep the ad on the air  because they want people in Congress to finally step up.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.  So, you're really doing a public service.</p><p>DAVIS:  If the NRA wants to come to the table and help us pass common sense  regulations that their members support, let's do it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Come to the table?  You just said F the NRA.</p><p>DAVIS:  We are not waiting on them to come to the table.</p><p>CARLSON:  You're really trying to have an adult conversation.  So, here is  your new spot.  And I want to talk to policy and see what you know about  it.  So, here's your latest 15-second ad.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVIS:  By the time this ad is done, an AR-15 could have fired 150 bullets.   That's why we need to ban assault weapons.  I'm Pat Davis, running for  Congress.  And I approve this message because lives are more important than  gun company profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you just said that in 15 seconds an AR-15 can fire 150  rounds.  Is that true?</p><p>DAVIS:  That's right.  You get it right here in New Mexico.  Right here in  New Mexico, you can go to a parking lot or go on the Internet, buy an  assault weapon, an AR-15 and buy a legally available add-on like a bump  stock that allows you to replicate exactly what happened in Las Vegas.</p><p>The Las Vegas shooter could shoot 600 rounds a minute.</p><p>CARLSON:  You are saying an AR-15 can shoot 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  So,  would it have a 150-round magazine?  What would that - let me ask - let's  be specific about your ad.  What would that magazine look like, the 150- round magazine?</p><p>DAVIS:  Exactly like the magazines the Las Vegas police officers pulled out  of that hotel room.  They had 50 and 100-round magazines and that weapon  was capable -</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you could fire - it is physically possible to fire - it's  not.  I mean, these are rhetorical questions.  You don't know what you're  talking about.  I know that you are a police officer.  Or you claim to have  been.</p><p>DAVIS:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  No AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  That's untrue.  And  if you believe it is true, then you are not qualified to have a  conversation about guns.  People are laughing at you because you are  ignorant.  You don't know what you're talking about.  No, no, that's just  untrue.</p><p>DAVIS:  We take exactly the word of the police officers in Las Vegas who I  trust who ran into that room to save people down below and found a weapon  that was modified with bump stocks.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, so they say an AR-15 - what do you think would happen to the  barrel in 15 seconds if you put 150 rounds?  It would melt.</p><p>DAVIS:  I know they get hot.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, my point is if you're going to take on the NRA and be Mr.  Tough, I was a cop guy, maybe you should know what you're talking about,  but you don't.</p><p>You are putting something on television that's demonstrably wrong, that's  physically possible, and all of your voters are like, oh, yes, this guy  knows what he's talking about, he was a cop, but you don't know.  So, maybe  you should apologize for it.</p><p>DAVIS:  I'm not apologizing for taking on the NRA.  I know why I'm pursuing  it.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'm sorry.  Politeness doesn't work.  I'm just trying to - oh,  OK.</p><p>I think you should apologize for saying something that's factually untrue.</p><p>DAVIS:  Apologies and politeness have not changed the conversation.  We  need new focus to take over and decide.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, that's why I'm not being polite.  I'm trying to get a real  conversation going here.  But you don't know what you're talking about, so  maybe you shouldn't be in a position to make decisions because you don't  understand the issue because you just told me with a straight face that an  AR-15 can fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds.  Oh, surprise.  It can't.</p><p>So, maybe you should admit that and move on to something you understand.   Would you do that?</p><p>DAVIS:  This is exactly the type of arguments that don't get us where we  need to be.  We need new leadership in Congress.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, it's not like, F the NRA.  That's the kind of argument we  need.  I thought politeness didn't work, tough guy?</p><p>DAVIS:  Politeness is not working so far.  If you woke up on Mother's Day  and you don't have your kid anymore -</p><p>CARLSON:  You know what works actually?  Facts work.  Why don't you get  some facts?  Oh, Pat, do you like this new mode of communication we have?   F the NRA, Pat.</p><p>DAVIS:  It would be great to have a conversation.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Learn something about funs and get back to me.  Interview over.   Yes, because you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p>Let's go back to politeness.  I like it better.  It's another primary night  and a Democrat who sounds like Donald Trump could be a winner tonight.   Amazing! He will join us.</p><p>Plus, Brit Hume joins us to break down the Democrats' 2018 message or lack  thereof.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  This is a Fox News alert.  Primary elections held tonight in the  State of Pennsylvania, polling places just closed.  A court there has  radically reshaped the state's congressional boundaries.</p><p>John Morganelli is a Democrat running for Congress in the newly reshaped  7th district in the state's northeast.  The district only narrowly  supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>And despite his party affiliation, Morganelli is anti-abortion and has  called for some restrictions on immigration and sanctuary cities.  Mr.  Morganelli joins us tonight.  Mr. Morganelli, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOHN MORGANELLI, PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Tucker, thanks for  having me tonight.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, as I understand, there are three candidates, Democratic  candidates, running in this primary tonight.  Polls have closed.  So, we  are not affecting anything with his interview.</p><p>But the three candidates each come from a different strain of the  Democratic Party ideologically.  Describe the kind of Democrat that you  are.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Well, Tucker, I've come out of a blue-collar background.  My  father was a construction worker with a sixth-grade education.  My mother  was a seamstress with 11th grade education.</p><p>And I believe that I've come out of the sort of the traditional Democratic  Party that's concerned about working men and women, that's concerned about  the blue-collar issues that affect these folks and I have always believed  the John F.  Kennedy model and, even to some degree, the Bill Clinton  model, who ran as a centrist.  And that's pretty much where I have been.   I'm not the strain of Democratic Party.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, I'm fascinated by the news coverage of your race.  So, you've  said things that don't seem very controversial, like you are not in favor  of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.  You are not against all  immigration, but you're worried about illegal immigration.  And you're not  for giving state-subsidized tuition to illegal immigrants.</p><p>For this, you are described as a hard-liner on immigration.  Do you think  that's fair?  Do you think the coverage of that subject is fair?</p><p>MORGANELLI:  No, I don't think it's fair.  First of all, I'm a grandson of  an Italian immigrant and I believe immigration is great.  It's made our  country great.</p><p>But immigration is a process.  There is laws that we have and people have  to get in line and come into the country in a legal way.  And to describe  me as a hard-liner, I think, is not accurate.  </p><p>I go to the naturalization service that we have in our county where people  from all over the world become naturalized citizens.  It's a wonderful  ceremony in the courthouse.  And those are immigrants.</p><p>What I'm opposed to is just people breaking into our country without  permission.  Some of them being criminals, and I've seen them in my own  county from the MS-13 gang and others.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  And then, our country giving incentives for more illegal  immigration such as driver's license and state tuition, I don't think those  incentives should be given.  It just creates more illegal immigration.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, Bill Clinton said that exact same thing 20 years ago.  Now,  you are one of only a couple Democrats willing to say that out loud.  What  happened to the Democratic Party?</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Well, it's interesting.  As you know, there is a picture - a  video of President Clinton giving, I think, a State of the Union speech  where he talks hard-line on immigration.  He says everything that I believe  in.  And even President Obama gave a similar speech.  So, this is not out  of step with Democrats.</p><p>I mean, in my own community here, I have great support for this position.   People here, Democratic voters, I don't think - I guess we'll know better  tonight - want foreign criminals coming into the county and setting up  shop.</p><p>They don't want sanctuary cities.  I have opposed sanctuary cities for a  long, long time.  Having a sanctuary city is like putting up a big sign  that says, please, all foreign criminals, come here because we won't do  anything about it if you commit a crime.</p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  So, I don't think that all Democrats are in lockstep  necessarily with some of the national philosophy that comes out of  Washington on this issue.</p><p>CARLSON:  Man, I hope you are right.  And the polls have closed, so I can  say that I'm certainly rooting for you tonight.  John Morganelli, thanks a  lot for coming on.</p><p>MORGANELLI:  Thank you.  Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Probably won't help.  Well, with some candidates on the  Democratic side flipping the bird to the NRA, while others back Trump-style  immigration, it's not quite clear what the Democratic message is for 2018.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst.  He watches carefully.  He  joins us tonight.  Brit, what do you think the message is?  Or is there a  national message that the Democratic Party is selling this midterm?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think it's pretty  indistinct at this moment, if there is one, Tucker.  I think that much of  the party is so mesmerized by Donald Trump and loathes him so deeply that  that has become kind of the central thing and the central theme that you  can see with the Democratic - that's what the Democratic Party appears to  be mostly about right now.  I suspect, as time goes on, something more  oriented towards voters will come along.</p><p>But, remember, Tucker, these candidates are running in a party where 71  percent, according to one recent poll, want Donald Trump impeached.  So,  it's kind of understandable that there would be some focus on him.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  For sure.  Most Democrats are, of course, very anti-Trump.   That's why they are Democrats.  But is that a message that moves people to  the polls?</p><p>HUME:  Well, based on the evidence we have, it seems not to be working very  well.  And the reason I say that is, look at the advantages that Democrats  enjoy going into this midterm election.</p><p>First of all, the political gravity in any president's first midterm is  always with the other party and the average loss is more than would be  enough - if they made their average again, the Democrats would get control  of the House.</p><p>Now, they had a huge gap in what's called the generic ballot.  You know,  Tucker, that's the one where you ask people if they'd rather vote for a  Democrat or Republican unnamed in the upcoming election.</p><p>Normally, Democrats do well on that ballot.  They were up plus 15 or 16 at  one point not very long ago.  And now, that number is down to single  digits.  And some polls down to low single digits which suggest that  whatever they are selling, people are not buying with the enthusiasm that  the party had hoped for.</p><p>CARLSON:  What will happen if they don't retake the House?</p><p>HUME:  Well, I think there will be an agonizing reappraisal because we've  been hearing about this blue wave that was thought to be inevitable, and  may yet come.</p><p>If it doesn't come, obviously, there's going to be a search for scapegoats.   And we will see what happens.</p><p>But this party, I think, Tucker, what we're seeing emerge now is that for  all the divisions in the Republican Party between Trump supporters and the  never Trumpers and so on and all the divisions within the conservative  movement over that, the divisions in the Democratic Party are at least as  deep, if not deeper.  </p><p>And at the heart of the Democratic Party - I remember you saying in a  speech not too many years ago - was not with Hillary Clinton, but she won  anyway.</p><p>A candidate of her stripe, I don't think, could win this time.  I don't  know that a white male candidate could win.</p><p>So, here we are, the Democrats really have some serious divisions to worry  about.  And whether whatever they come up with will be appealing to a broad  cross section of voters is, obviously, what remains to be seen.</p><p>CARLSON:  A white male candidate could not win.  I don't think a lot of the  white male candidates running for the Democratic nomination know that yet,  but I think they're going to learn.</p><p>And do you think that it moves in the direction of populist economics,  become the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders party?</p><p>HUME:  Well, I think that's the drift.  And I think that excites a lot of  people.  And, of course, if you look at the attitudes of young voters now,  who do not seem to have grasped the benefits of a market capitalist economy  and don't seem to be put off at all about the idea of socialism despite  socialism's abysmal history, which is playing out even today in certain  parts of the world, Venezuela being the most conspicuous example, but I  think the party - it's gotten pretty far left now.  And a lot of old ideas  that are being passed off as kind of new ideas are in the air.</p><p>And the party will have to reckon with that because if they come up with  somebody who is an out and out socialist for president, I don't think they  could possibly win.  And I'm not sure how many of them we'll see, but there  will be awful battles over this.</p><p>CARLSON:  Their corporate donors, because the party is entirely supported  by corporate America, are going to pretty surprised when it turns out  they're sending money to Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>HUME:  No, I was just going to say don't underestimate the ability of a  leftist candidate to raise money from small donations and make a serious  run for it.  Bernie Sanders certainly did.</p><p>CARLSON:  No, that's right.  I just think that Goldman Sachs guys are going  to be pretty shocked when they see what's coming.  Great to see you.</p><p>HUME:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, an embattled minority group is under attack in South Africa  and on the receiving end of genocidal rhetoric.  It is considered  unacceptable to talk about this in the media in the West for some reason,  but we don't care because it's true and it's happening and it's news and we  are covering it.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, now to a fascinating and significant story the media have  all but ignored.  South Africa is a diverse country, but the South African  government would like to make it much less diverse.</p><p>An embattled minority of farmers, mostly Afrikaans speaking, is being  targeted in a wave of barbaric and horrifying murders.</p><p>But instead of protecting them, the government just passed a law allowing  it to seize their farms without any compensation based purely on their  ethnicity and distribute those farms to more favored groups.</p><p>Thousands have already migrated out of the country, but they've struggled  to attract any sympathy abroad for some reason.</p><p>Ernst Roets is deputy CEO of AfriForum.  It's a South Africa civil rights  group.  He was just in the United States to meet with a number of  government officials.  He also took a moment to talk to us.  Here's part of  what he said.</p><p>Ernst Roets joins us now.  Mr. Roets, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ERNST ROETS, SOUTH AFRICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST:  Thank you very much.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you describe in this book a disorganized, but in some sense  intentional campaign to crush a racial minority within your country and the  government seems onboard with it.  Is that an overstatement?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, what the book is about is it's about government complicity in  the scourge of farm attacks and farm murders that we've seen in South  Africa.</p><p>So, in only the last two decades, there's been - according to government  statistics, which we believe - we have reason to say that it's maybe  downplayed a little.  There's been about two farm attacks every day and two  farm murders every week in South Africa.</p><p>And in the book, I highlight actually ten different reasons why we believe  the South African government is complicit.  And it stretches from reasons  including - the fact that as these attacks have worsened - for example, in  2007, there was a 25 percent increase in these attacks and then the South  African government responded saying we're not going to release any more  statistics about this.</p><p>Then also, which is very concerning, is the hate speech in South Africa.   That's the title of the book as well, \"Kill the Boer\", which is a very  popular song which is still being sung in South Africa.  It was sung just  the other day.  So, it's sung at political rallies.</p><p>And, of course, Boer referring to a particular cultural group in South  Africa.</p><p>CARLSON:  Right.</p><p>ROETS:  We have songs like \"Shoot the Boer\", which is a different song.   There are a variety of ways in which - </p><p>CARLSON:  But I thought that hate speech was now a crime punishable by  prison time in South Africa.  Are any of the people who say this arrested?</p><p>ROETS:  There's a bill on the table to have hate speech declared a crime  punishable by prison time.  But if you look at the motivation around it,  it's very clear that - I think those in government who are pushing this  don't regard this as hate speech.</p><p>As a matter of fact, they've been arguing that it's not hate speech in  court.  So, they would argue that they have a right to sing about killing  farmers and then they would say it's an expression of freedom of speech.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, now the government has announced that it plans to pursue a  policy of taking land away from people on the basis of their skin color.   Do you think they'll do that?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, that's what was adopted in our parliament in February.  A  motion was adopted that the property rights clause in the South African  constitution has to be changed to allow for expropriation of private  property without compensation.</p><p>So, the state president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that this would turn South  Africa into the ultimate paradise and the Garden of Eden and Deputy  President David Mabuza even went further saying that - basically  threatening white farmers that if they do not voluntarily hand over their  land to black people, then there would be a violent takeover.  So, the  situation is very dire in South Africa.</p><p>But the good news is that there is still a process that has to be followed  and that's why we are in the United States.</p><p>CARLSON:  What I find so striking is the response from everyone else around  the world.  It's almost never covered in the American media.  There is a  sense that the people being murdered deserve it because of what their  ancestors did.  And the international community is similarly silent.</p><p>Have you met with any government officials here in Washington about what's  happening in your country?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, that's why we are here.  We are about to meet with some  government officials and it's very unfortunate, the situation that you've  just mentioned.</p><p>Especially in South Africa, there's a hierarchy of recognition.  So, some  people, when they are the victims, it's all over the news and you hear  about it frequently.  And other people, especially farmers in South Africa,  white farmers in particular, they would be tortured to death and it would  receive very little news coverage.</p><p>And that's unfortunately the situation abroad as well, which is why we are  very grateful to be having this.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, a government official in Australia said publicly maybe we  ought to allow asylum to people being persecuted for their skin color in  your country and he was basically laughed at and then attacked by your  government for saying that.</p><p>ROETS:  Yes, he was attacked.  And they then said that he shouldn't say  that because AfriForum was providing them with false information.  Well,  the information that we're quoting is government statistics.</p><p>So, that is the situation.  Whoever speaks out against this - we, just for  being in the United States, we've been accused of treason, we've had people  threatening us, saying they will wait for us at the airport when we come  back and they'll attack us and so forth.  We had the state president today  in parliament calling on us to go back to South Africa.</p><p>So, whenever you speak out against this, there is a very serious backlash.</p><p>CARLSON:  This is not what Nelson Mandela wanted.</p><p>ROETS:  No, it's the exact opposite than what he wanted.  He spoke about a  free country in which people were not judged by the color of their skin.   And he even wanted farm attacks to be a priority crime.</p><p>He said that when he was president.  And when his presidency was over, they  deprioritized it.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, you just watch something like this happen in a neighboring  country, Zimbabwe, which went from being one of the richest in Africa to  the poorest in the world because of farm attacks and because of the theft  of private property, is the ANC, the ruling party in South Africa, aware of  that lesson?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, they are, but you know that saying real communism has never  been tried.  That's what they keep saying.  So, it failed in Zimbabwe.  It  failed in Cuba.  It failed in Venezuela.  It failed in Russia.  It failed  in China.  All of those countries.</p><p>And they are basically saying that we're going to try the same thing, but  this time it's going to work.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, last question.  It's considered basically immoral in the  United States to talk to you or to hear stories like this for reasons that  nobody ever bothers really to explain, but it's just understood.</p><p>If you could speak to our media, to the people who are dismissing your  claims as false, what would you say?</p><p>ROETS:  Well, I think there are three things.  Firstly, everything we say  is fact based.  It's based on research.  But in terms of what we hope to  achieve and what people can do, people who want to invest in South Africa,  we want them to call on the South African government to say, listen, you  are calling on us to invest in your country, but you want to expropriate  those investments.</p><p>Number two, we are speaking with the US government and asking them to put  pressure on the South African government, which could be done in a variety  of ways.</p><p>And number three, members of the public and members of the media, the best  thing that you can do to help us is to talk about this, to talk about it on  public platforms and in that way to continue to put pressure on the South  African government not to continue with this policy.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Just to tell the truth.  I agree.  Mr. Roets, thank you.</p><p>ROETS:  Thanks very much.  Thank you for being here.</p><p>CARLSON:  Tech companies are getting more powerful, even as we sleep.   Facebook has a plan for ranking news outlets by how trustworthy it says  they are, while Twitter plans to just censor certain views entirely.  A  brave new world has arrived.  Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to fund  terrorists in Somalia.  That's according to a new report by a Fox affiliate  in the twin cities.</p><p>According to that story, many members of Minnesota's Somali immigrant  community have discovered they can open sham day care centers that only  pretend to watch children, collect a fat subsidy from the state for doing  that and keep the change.  They have made millions of dollars, up to 100  million according to that report.  That would be half of Minnesota's annual  budget for child care assistance.</p><p>Again, these are people who are resettled here as an act of charity by our  country, accused now of defrauding our country.  And not just fraud, fraud  so brazen, the report says, that Somalis buy shares in fake day care  outlets to get a cut of it.</p><p>Some of this fraudulently obtained money is reportedly being shipped back  to Somalia in suitcases full of cash to evade federal wire transfer  restrictions.</p><p>Some of this money is ending up in regions of Somalia controlled by the  Islamic terror group, Al-Shabab.</p><p>Well, Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is outraged by the  story.  It's not the fraud that makes him mad or the ingratitude or the  injustice.  It was that it was exposed at all.  That offended him.</p><p>In a statement, he denounced the new report on the grounds that it could  hinder further cash transfers to Somalia, which apparently he cares more  about than America, which he's supposed be representing.</p><p>According to Congressman Ellison, briefcases of untraceable cash in Somalia  hurt Al-Shabab rather than helping them somehow.</p><p>Well, apparently, it's not enough for the tech companies to know what you  do, and they do know what you do, increasingly they want to control what  you do and what you see and what you think.</p><p>During a recent meeting with investors, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  revealed that his company has been ranking news outlets by how trustworthy  they are, with less trusted outlets being penalized on Facebook's news  feed.  Trusted, by the way, by Facebook, not by you, but by Mark Zuckerberg  and his deputies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Twitter is implementing a system to suppress tweets it regards  as harassment, even if those tweets actually break no rules.  In other  words, if Twitter disagrees with the political orientation of the tweets.</p><p>Brett Larson hosts \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\" and investigates big tech for  the show.  We're grateful he does.  He joins us tonight.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" HOST:  Hey, Tucker.  Good  to be here.  We have been investigating this story over the past few days  now, involving Facebook changes to how they handle news sources in user's  news feed.</p><p>As you mentioned, in a meeting with media company executives from \"The New  York Times\" to News Corp., which is the parent company of Fox News,  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said they will be relying on user surveys to  determine which news sources are \"broadly trusted.\" Now, the comments were made following Facebook's F8 Developer Conference.   That was at the beginning of the month.  And this is one of the many  changes the social media giant has made in an effort to combat fake news,  fake accounts and bots that help amplify and spread fake information.</p><p>Now, I spoke with Facebook earlier today and they assured me that this  isn't an effort to censor any ideas or beliefs and that the random sampling  of trustworthiness happens frequently to ensure sites are getting a fair  shake.</p><p>It works like this.  A user will be presented with a simple yes or no  question about a news site.  Are you familiar with the site?  A \"yes\"  answer brings up the next question to rate it for trustworthiness on a  scale of 1 to 5.</p><p>Now, what about fake accounts boosting the trustworthiness of a not-so- trustworthy news outlet?  Well, Facebook just this year has removed more  than half a billion fake accounts.</p><p>Further, those headlines like \"They pulled over to help this dog, what  happened next will amaze you.\", not going to get the kind of ranking in  your news feed going forward as the changes are also meant to crackdown on  so-called clickbait and focus more on news, especially local news.  </p><p>Now, as for paying providers for that news, no deal.  Cable operators pay  to carry channels like Fox for their customers.  But when asked if Facebook  will do the same thing, the online giant saying, they don't see a need for  that.</p><p>Despite the fact that they're renewing focus on local news, it would seem  that kind of revenue would breathe life into local newspapers and news  outlets that are struggling to remain relevant and profitable in the age of  digital.</p><p>And, Tucker, these changes aren't helping us feel any better.  In this  effort to see more news from friends and less news from media sites, it  actually puts us in a bad mood because we compare ourselves to our friends  and our peers and we see what we are missing out on.  Think parties and  awesome vacations that we are not on.  Tucker?  </p><p>It's what we all want.  We don't want to be informed, we want to feel bad!</p><p>CARLSON:  Maybe we need a vacation from social media.</p><p>LARSON:  I think we all do.</p><p>CARLSON:  I think we do.  Brett, great to see you.</p><p>LARSON:  Thanks, Tucker.  Good to be here.</p><p>CARLSON:  Up next, the \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" isn't just ruling the airwaves  in other channels, he's also up to new antics online.  We feel obligated to  bring you the latest on that.  Pretty amusing actually.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Sad news tonight.  The \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" seems to be  unstoppable.  He's taken over the 2018 election cycle in two cable news  networks.  He'll be running for president himself before long.</p><p>But like other ominous entities like killer robots to Jeff Bezos, the  \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" needs energy to function and he gets that through  attention and validation until today.</p><p>He posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he ought to keep going on TV or  give people who aren't creepy porn lawyers a chance.  Thousands have voted.   Ninety three percent want him to keep gumming up the air waves.  Doubtless  his act of crass self-validation will keep \"Creepy Porn Lawyer\" fully  operational for at least another 36 hours.  Sad news!</p><p>And on that note, thanks for the hour.  Sean Hannity is next from New York.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It8217;s maddening.)

Worker wages remain stagnant as wealthy executives are rolling in cash[21] (Wait, you mean a tax cut for rich people and big corporations isn8217;t 8220;trickling down?8221; But Trump and other Republicans like Corey Stewart PROMISED it would! LOL) 8216;It8217;s a significant shift in our thinking8217;: Business takes fresh look at Democrats[22] (8220;If businesses shift significant support away from Republicans, it could deal a blow to GOP fundraising.

The Republican U.S. Senate nominee, who promised a brutal, vicious, ruthless, and cutthroat campaign, says he8217;s being picked on by the media.8221; Corey is utterly pathetic.)

But granting him a senior fellowship position 8212; one they learned of through a press release 8212; runs 8216;counter to the Center8217;s fundamental values of nonpartisanship, transparency, openness, a passion for truth and objectivity, and civility.'8221; UVA has disgraced itself by doing this.) L.F. Payne and Frank Atkinson column: UVa8217;s appointment of ex-Trump aide advances academic integrity[37] (Uhhhhh8230;no.) Two Historians Resigned Over the Appointment of a Trump Flunky at UVA.

Sparking the debate was a report that Facebook  was unable to prevent the improper use of data by the firm Cambridge Analytica. Despite Facebook's request that the firm delete its data back in 2015, it learned several days ago that the firm did not comply. Because Facebook was unable to properly oversee how others use its data, the company's policy on how they handle data is being put into question. We spoke to this report in-length <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, and although this event is not ideal for shareholders, this is the exact type of single stock risk we wanted to prevent when we aggressively trimmed our position back in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p>As for our current view on the stock, shares are trading at roughly 19.5 times consensus 2019 earnings per share estimates, a discount to the S&amp;P 500 which trades at roughly 21 times next year earnings. When you strip it down, we believe that this multiple is already too steep of a discount because the company grew roughly 40% on both the top and bottom lines and monetization opportunities expected to continue. However, in the near-term, do we think that the multiple could slightly compress on this headline risk? It is a possibility because this story line is not going away overnight. Now the stock is holding up today in pre-market, but both the day and week are young, and tech selloffs typically spread across multiple days. If the multiple falls a leg lower to 18 times next year earnings, or roughly $160, we certainly view that as a strong opportunity to get in. For those looking to get a cheap price in general, we think shares could be nibbled at here, though we do note the near-term headline risks.</p><p>Elsewhere in the market, thanks to the net $11,000 we took out of the market last week with an additional $23,5000 in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  , </emphasis>we have put ourselves in a flexible position to buy. Now full disclaimer, we are still looking for opportunities where we can prune positions to raise funds when appropriate, but we want to gradually put cash to work here as the market moves back to oversold territory. Even though the futures are pointing higher, tech rotations can spread over multiple days, so we are being more cautious in that area, thus our pecking order is accordingly:</p><p>We are in favor of the financials given that we are in a rising interest rate environment that could be further added to following the FOMC meeting tomorrow. Goldman Sachs  and JPMorgan  are two names we target during any market weakness, and we will continue to do so as they are in a cheap group and are beneficiaries of higher interest rates, lower corporate taxes, and deregulation. Also, volatility in the markets should boost trading revenues.</p><p>We like our large industrials, Honeywell  , 3M  , and we will include DowDuPont  to the group. For Honeywell and 3M, we will look to add to our position below our lowest buys so that it meaningfully improves our cost basis. DowDuPont we have a sizeable gain in, but we would be buyers here if we were looking to start a position. We would also love to add more Raytheon  , but the stock was unaffected by yesterday's selloff and shares are still higher from where we broke basis twice last week, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p>After the financials and industrials, that is when we would go to technology. To reiterate, we would not be surprised to see some selling spread over the next few days, especially as the European Union is expected to levy a 3% digital tax on advertising revenues on the big tech giants in the near-future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14528181</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-B141-JCHV-V324-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"595\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>Glossary</p><p>ADVT: Average Daily Volume of shares Traded<br/>Annual Return: Dividends Paid In a 12-Month Period/Price at the Beginning of the Period + Capital Gain or Loss over 1 Year/Price 1 Year Ago (%)<br/>Capital Gain/Loss from n Years Ago to n-1 Years Ago: Capital Gain or Loss over 1 Year/Price 1 Year Ago (%)<br/>Current Ratio: Current Assets/Current Liabiliites (times)<br/>Debt/Equity: Net Debt/Net Assets %<br/>Dividend Yield: Dividend Per Share/Share Price (%)<br/>EBIT Margin : Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Revenue (%)<br/>Income during the n years (3/2/1): Dividends received during the Period<br/>Interest Cover: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Interest (times)<br/>PCP: Previous Corresponding Period<br/>PV1000: Present value of 1000 invested 1 year/'n' years ago<br/>Price/Earnings: Share Price/Earnings Per Share (times)<br/>Price/Sales: Share Price/Sales Per Share (times)<br/>Relative Price Change [RPC]: Relative price change is price change of stock with respect to Benchmark Index<br/>Relative Strength (6 Months): Price close today/Price close 6 months ago, then ranked by percentile within the entire market.<br/>Return on Assets: Net Profit/Total Assets (%)<br/>Return on Equity (Shareholders' Funds): Net Profit/Net Assets (%)<br/>TSR: Total Shareholder Returns is expressed as an annualized rate of return for shareholders after allowing for capital appreciation and dividend<br/>Total Liabilities/Total Assets: Total Liabilities/Total Assets<br/>Volume Index (VI): Number of shares traded in the period/Average number of shares traded for the period<br/>Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is the summation of turnover divided by total volume in the same period.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRUADR-9920200915Adr2478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRUADR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VC-5J01-DXKH-N1PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>1.5 People's News<br/>Mon Aug 17, 2020<br/>Sigve Brekke was appointed CEO of Telenor (OB:TEL) five years ago on August 17, 2015.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>SECTION 13 Snapshot of 11 Norwegian

This large userbase means Facebook has a large effect on our society and our democracy. That was made evident in the 2016 presidential election.<br/>Since 2017, Facebook has removed over 100 networks that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, like the fake Russian news organization Peace Data. Facebook says it now works with 70 different third-party fact-checking partners and has greatly increased its ad transparency.<br/>But the threats of 2020 will be much different than 2016. Watch CNBC's exploration of what Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg are doing to protect the 2020 election, and whether those efforts will be enough.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 18: Netflix documentary 'The Social Dilemma' prompts social media users to rethink Facebook, Instagram and others<br/>LONDON - Social media users are re-evaluating whether they should have accounts on platforms like Facebook and Instagram after a new documentary-drama called \"The Social Dilemma\" dropped on Netflix.<br/>The 90-minute show, which focuses on the downsides of the major tech platforms, features interviews with Silicon Valley whistleblowers who used to work at the likes of Google and Facebook. In many ways, they're sounding the alarm on their own creations. One former Facebook executive, Tim Kendall, who was asked what worried him most, said: \"In the shortest time horizon, I'm most worried about civil war.\"<br/>Somewhat ironically, social media is awash with people saying they plan to delete their social media accounts after watching the show, with Facebook and Instagram appearing to be called out most frequently.<br/>\"Everyone should watch The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix and then make the necessary changes,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Tonight I deleted Facebook and turned off notifications from Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. It's time to take back control of our minds.\"<br/>Another Twitter user said: \"Just watched this and immediately deleted #Facebook and #Instagram. A must watch to understand the manipulation.\"<br/>Ranked as the 5th most watched show on Netflix in the U.K. on Friday and hailed as \"the most important documentary of our times\" by The Independent newspaper, \"The Social Dilemma\" shines a light on how tech companies influence national elections, \"follow\" billions of people around the internet in order to deliver targeted ads to them and come up with features that drive addiction.<br/>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment when asked whether it was concerned about a potential user backlash.<br/>Instead the California-headquartered firm pointed to several announcements and resources on safety and mental health.</p><p>September 17: Facebook issues new rules on internal employee communication<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday outlined to employees a new set of principles to guide debates and conversations within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Zuckerberg outlined the changes to address \"a lot of very tense conversations happening out in the world,\" according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The new principles follow a set of similar changes at Google, which is increasing the moderation of its internal message boards, CNBC reported earlier this week.<br/>\"We deeply value expression and open discussion. What we've heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,\" Osborne said in a statement. \"We're updating our employee policies and work tools to ensure our culture remains respectful and inclusive.\"<br/>The changes follow a set of recent leaks from Workplace and the company's weekly Q&amp;As showing that employees have increased their criticism of the company's policies.<br/>Under the new set of principles, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will ensure all employees feel supported at work, especially the company's Black community, by strengthening the company's harassment policy with more protections for underrepresented employees.<br/>The company will also be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. This change will be so that employees do not have to confront social issues during their day-to-day work.<br/>Facebook's new principles also ask that employees communicate with professionalism and continue to debate about the company's work but do so in a respectful manner.<br/>BuzzFeed last month reported employees criticized Zuckerberg's explanation of why the company failed to remove a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to plan an event where two protesters were shot and killed.</p><p>September 17: Facebook is cracking down on groups that give health advice and promote violence<br/>Facebook on Thursday announced new policies that will limit the spread of groups on its social network that focus on giving users health advice, as well as groups with ties to violence.<br/>The company will no longer show health groups in its recommendations, saying a blog post that \"it's crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources.\" In the past, closed groups have been used by Facebook users to spread misinformation about vaccines and Covid-19.<br/>Similarly, the company said it will limit the spread of groups tied to violence by removing them from recommendations, restricting them from search and reducing how often their content shows up on people's News Feeds. This move comes as Facebook has struggled to moderate groups, including a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to organize an event where two people were killed in real life.<br/>Facebook said it removed the pages tied to that event after it happened, blaming an \"operational error\" for allowing the event to stay up despite the fact it violated the company's policies. But BuzzFeed later discovered that Facebook did not remove the pages; one of the group's admins did. It was only then that Facebook admitted it never took the event down.<br/>Additionally, Facebook will now archive groups that do not have admins, which are key to moderating groups. If an admin steps down from their role, they can invite other groups members to replace them. Facebook will also suggest this role to active members, but if no one steps up, the company will archive those groups. If Facebook removes a group for policy reasons, administrators and moderators of that group will be unable to create any new groups for a period of time.<br/>Facebook also said that it will prevent the admins and moderators of any groups that it removes for policy violations from creating any new groups \"for a period of time,\" although the company did not specify how long that window lasts.</p><p>September 17: As Main Street crisis worsens, Facebook launches new small business platform<br/>Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.<br/>\"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.<br/>The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.<br/>Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.<br/>This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a Covid hub in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a voter information center.<br/>Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.<br/>At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S.</p><p>September 16: Facebook's latest virtual reality headset is the best yet, but still feels antisocial<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset. It's a successor to last year's Quest and, like that version, doesn't require a computer to run. Everything you need to use VR is bundled inside.<br/>This is the strategy Facebook is taking moving forward. It's ditching the Oculus Rift headset, which required a PC to operate.<br/>You can still run advanced PC virtual reality games designed for the Rift on the Quest 2 using an Oculus Link USB-C cable. Oculus Link was in beta on the original Oculus Quest, but now it's an official feature. This is Facebook's long-term vision: a headset you can use anywhere you want, but that you can still link to a PC to render games that require more powerful hardware.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 16: Facebook teaming up with Ray-Ban maker for first smart glasses in 2021<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced a partnership with Luxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban, to release its first pair of smart glasses in 2021.<br/>\"After spending time with their team and visiting their factory, I knew that they were the right partner for us to help bring the best technology together with the best glasses,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a live stream from Facebook Connect, the company's online event for its virtual and augmented reality products.<br/>Facebook and Luxottica will make the glasses as part of a multiyear partnership. The pairing of the two companies was first reported by CNBC last year.<br/>\"I can't go into full product details yet, but they're really the next step on the road to augmented reality glasses,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And they look pretty good too.\"<br/>Zuckerberg also announced that the company plans to release Project Aria, a research device that the company will use to learn as it develops its consumer smart glasses.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 15: Facebook shares fall as Kim Kardashian West calls for one-day boycott<br/>Celebrities are calling out Facebook for not doing enough to stop disinformation and hate on its platform. CNBC's Frank Holland joins 'Closing Bell' to discuss.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 15: Kim Kardashian West and other celebrities will boycott Instagram for one day to protest Facebook's 'failures'<br/>A group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher have said they will participate in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" on Wednesday as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>A slew of big-name advertisers including Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Verizon paused to their social media budgets this summer after \"Stop Hate For Profit\" called on advertisers to boycott Facebook for the month of July. The goal, the group said, was to pressure the company into taking more stringent steps to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation on its platform.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 15: Facebook<br/>Shares of the group known as \"FAANGM\" rose broadly as tech tried to build on its solid gains from the previous session.

At the time, Facebook said Apple would not make an exception to its rules to give the full amount of the transactions to the businesses hosting the events. Facebook already waived its cut through its Facebook Pay system, and Google agreed not to take its standard 30% cut of the transactions through the Android version of the app.<br/>An Apple spokesperson told CNBC it reversed its decision on the Facebook event fees due to the pressures businesses are facing from the pandemic, and that Apple wants to give those businesses more time to adapt to digital business models. The spokesperson also said its App Store rule that requires the 30% cut to Apple does not apply to ticketing real-world events, only digital events, and Facebook has until the end of the year to implement in-app payments for real-world events. Airbnb and ClassPass also have until the end of the year to add the in-app payments for events, Apple said.<br/>\"The App Store provides a great business opportunity for all developers, who use it to reach half a billion visitors each week across 175 countries,\" Apple said in a statement. \"To ensure every developer can create and grow a successful business, Apple maintains a clear, consistent set of guidelines that apply equally to everyone.\"<br/>Facebook's announcement on Friday also takes a shot at Apple's App Store policies, claiming they're harmful to small businesses struggling amid a pandemic-fueled recession.</p><p>September 24: Facebook adds more guidelines for internal employee speech, banning political images in profile pics<br/>Facebook on Thursday outlined its new set of rules for employee communications within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Chief among the new changes is a requirement that employees use a photo of themselves or their initials as their profile pictures. This change would prohibit employees from setting their profile pictures to images that promote specific political candidates or causes, for instance.<br/>\"We deeply value expression, open discussion, and a company culture built on respect and inclusivity,\" Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \"What we have heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed. So we're updating our policies and work tools to make sure our people have both voice, and choice.\"<br/>The new rules come a week after CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about a new set of principles to guide internal debates and conversations.<br/>Facebook's new rules will also expand the company's definition of harassment. The company will prohibit any communication that is insensitive, degrading or derogatory and could create a hostile work environment for those in a protected class.<br/>Additionally, the company will be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. Facebook will also increase its support for moderation of nonofficial Workplace groups.<br/>These changes come after a series of leaks over the past few months from employee Workplace posts as well as Facebook's weekly Q&amp;A with Zuckerberg.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 22: One of the founders of Facebook's libra digital currency has left the company<br/>One of the co-founders of Facebook's libra digital currency and Novi payments wallet has left the company before the release of either technology.<br/>Morgan Beller, 27, is leaving her post as Novi's head of strategy to become a partner at NFX, a venture capital firm focused on seed investments with offices in San Francisco and Herzliya, Israel.<br/>\"When I knew there was an opportunity to go [to NFX] and get to work with these people, that was an opportunity I couldn't really pass up,\" Beller told CNBC.<br/>Beller rose to prominence in 2019 as one of the founders behind libra, developing the idea for the Facebook-backed digital currency alongside David Marcus, a former PayPal president and Facebook vice president.<br/>After joining Facebook's corporate development team in 2017, Beller quickly turned her attention to the potential of what Facebook and its more than 2 billion users at the time could do with blockchain technology.<br/>Beller was credited by those in the blockchain community as the original driving force behind Facebook's push into cryptocurrency.<br/>Facebook expected to launch libra and Calibra, now called Novi, in the first half of 2020.

The start to that process could come as soon as this year. The Wall Street Journal this month reported the Federal Trade Commission is now gearing up to possibly file an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook before the end of 2020.<br/>An antitrust lawsuit against Facebook would kick off a years-long process. And it is unclear just what consequences the tech company would face.<br/>Among the possibilities are the divestment of Instagram, WhatsApp or both. The company could also face restrictions about what data it collects or how that data can be used to target ads to users.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 22: Facebook<br/>Shares of mega-cap technology companies fell broadly on Monday, continuing their spiral that started in early September.

This large userbase means Facebook has a large effect on our society and our democracy. That was made evident in the 2016 presidential election.<br/>Since 2017, Facebook has removed over 100 networks that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, like the fake Russian news organization Peace Data. Facebook says it now works with 70 different third-party fact-checking partners and has greatly increased its ad transparency.<br/>But the threats of 2020 will be much different than 2016.

In many ways, they're sounding the alarm on their own creations. One former Facebook executive, Tim Kendall, who was asked what worried him most, said: \"In the shortest time horizon, I'm most worried about civil war.\"<br/>Somewhat ironically, social media is awash with people saying they plan to delete their social media accounts after watching the show, with Facebook and Instagram appearing to be called out most frequently.<br/>\"Everyone should watch The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix and then make the necessary changes,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Tonight I deleted Facebook and turned off notifications from Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. It's time to take back control of our minds.\"<br/>Another Twitter user said: \"Just watched this and immediately deleted #Facebook and #Instagram. A must watch to understand the manipulation.\"<br/>Ranked as the 5th most watched show on Netflix in the U.K. on Friday and hailed as \"the most important documentary of our times\" by The Independent newspaper, \"The Social Dilemma\" shines a light on how tech companies influence national elections, \"follow\" billions of people around the internet in order to deliver targeted ads to them and come up with features that drive addiction.<br/>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment when asked whether it was concerned about a potential user backlash.<br/>Instead the California-headquartered firm pointed to several announcements and resources on safety and mental health.</p><p>September 17: Facebook issues new rules on internal employee communication<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday outlined to employees a new set of principles to guide debates and conversations within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Zuckerberg outlined the changes to address \"a lot of very tense conversations happening out in the world,\" according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The new principles follow a set of similar changes at Google, which is increasing the moderation of its internal message boards, CNBC reported earlier this week.<br/>\"We deeply value expression and open discussion. What we've heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,\" Osborne said in a statement. \"We're updating our employee policies and work tools to ensure our culture remains respectful and inclusive.\"<br/>The changes follow a set of recent leaks from Workplace and the company's weekly Q&amp;As showing that employees have increased their criticism of the company's policies.<br/>Under the new set of principles, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will ensure all employees feel supported at work, especially the company's Black community, by strengthening the company's harassment policy with more protections for underrepresented employees.<br/>The company will also be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. This change will be so that employees do not have to confront social issues during their day-to-day work.<br/>Facebook's new principles also ask that employees communicate with professionalism and continue to debate about the company's work but do so in a respectful manner.<br/>BuzzFeed last month reported employees criticized Zuckerberg's explanation of why the company failed to remove a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to plan an event where two protesters were shot and killed.</p><p>September 17: As Main Street crisis worsens, Facebook launches new small business platform<br/>Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.<br/>\"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.<br/>The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.<br/>Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.<br/>This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a Covid hub in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a voter information center.<br/>Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.<br/>At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S.</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>Source: The Wall Street Journal<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"544\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Google, Twitter and Facebook CEOs Threatened With Subpoena</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 16</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FTC Preparing Possible Antitrust Suit Against Facebook</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Buys REI s New Headquarters as Pandemic Prompts Sale</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 11</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Appeals Move to Curb EU-U.S. Data Transfer</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 09</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Ireland to Order Facebook to Stop Sending User Data to U.S.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 05</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook s Rittenhouse Mistake</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Bloomberg<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"552\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 27</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Sues EU Over 'Irrelevant' Demands in Antitrust Probes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 13</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Investment Helps Asia's Richest Man Shed Oil Dependence</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 06</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Helps Explain Why ESG Investing Matters</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 03</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Under Siege After Facebook Scrutiny</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Other Publishers<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Publisher</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Apple Decides to Waive 30% Cut of Paid Events on Facebook, but Only for 3 Months</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Nasdaq</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Is Starting To Get Liked Again After a Brutal Sell-Off</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">InvestorPlace on MSN.com</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Q3 2020 EPS Estimates for Facebook, Inc.

Few Democrats have raised similar concerns.</p><p>Big tech companies like Google are getting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators</url> around the world for a wide variety of issues, including their influence on political debate, their handling of consumer data, and the aggressive way they compete with smaller companies.</p><p>A day before the Gabbard lawsuit was filed, Facebook said the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">Federal Trade Commission had opened a formal antitrust investigation</url> into its business practices. Earlier in the day, the F.T.C. announced that Facebook was fined a record $5 billion for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p>Tulsi Now Inc., the campaign committee for Ms. Gabbard, said Google suspended the campaign\u2019s advertising account for six hours on June 27 and June 28, obstructing its ability to raise money and spread her message to potential voters.</p><p>After the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">first Democratic debate</url>, Ms. Gabbard was briefly the most searched-for candidate on Google. Her campaign wanted to capitalize on the attention she was receiving by buying ads that would have placed its website at the top of search results for her name.</p><p>The lawsuit also said the Gabbard campaign believed its emails were being placed in spam folders on Gmail at \u201ca disproportionately high rate\u201d when compared with emails from other Democratic candidates.<br/></p><p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s arbitrary and capricious treatment of Gabbard\u2019s campaign should raise concerns for policymakers everywhere about the company\u2019s ability to use its dominance to impact political discourse, in a way that interferes with the upcoming 2020 presidential election,\u201d the lawsuit said.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard and her campaign are seeking an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages of at least $50 million.</p><p>Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts \u2014 including large spending changes \u2014 to prevent fraud, said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for the company.</p><p>\u201cIn this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.\u201d</p><p>No other campaigns have publicly claimed that Google has suspended their advertising accounts.</p><p>Interest in Ms. Gabbard, who has served four terms in the House and is an Army National Guard veteran, spiked after the debate. She entered the presidential race as a relative unknown and is still polling at less than 1 percent, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">New York Times polling averages</url>.</p><p>But her appeal has crossed traditional party lines. She has drawn support from both the right and the left because of a staunch antiwar message. She has also received <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">favorable coverage</url> from influential conservative news media like Drudge Report, Fox News and Breitbart.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard\u2019s campaign is historic even in a race with many potential firsts. She was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21, becoming the youngest woman to join a United States state legislature. When she was elected as representative for Hawaii in 2012, she was the first Samoan-American and first Hindu member of Congress.</p><p>Her political views are unusual among Democratic candidates. She has a history of making anti-gay statements and worked for an anti-gay advocacy group run by her father. (She has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">since apologized</url> and said her past views were wrong.)</p><p>And she has tapped into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">increasingly bipartisan passion</url>: wariness of big tech. The lawsuit filed Thursday said Ms. Gabbard had joined Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is also vying to be the Democratic Party nominee, in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html\">calling for large tech companies</url> like Facebook, Google and Amazon to be broken up.</p><p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said in a statement. \u201cThis is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.\u201d</p><p>While assertions of tech firms tipping the scales against political opponents are largely unproven, the lawsuit taps into concern that tech companies aren\u2019t transparent about how decisions are made and they aren\u2019t held accountable when things go wrong.</p><p>Last week, senators homed in on Google in a subcommittee hearing about censorship in search. The hearing aired many largely unproven claims that Google tilts search results against conservative viewpoints.</p><p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s control over what people hear, read, watch and see is unprecedented,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas who led the subcommittee. \u201cWith that market power, Google can and often does control our discourse.\u201d</p><p>Gabbard campaign workers sent an email to a Google representative on June 27 at 9:30 p.m. once they realized the account had been suspended. In emails reviewed by The New York Times, the campaign sent Google a screenshot of a notice of suspension for \u201cproblems with billing information or violations of our advertising policies.\u201d</p><p>The account was reactivated at 3:30 a.m. on June 28.

This article outlines the main points of the law suit and evidence the social media giant Google has quietly acquired enormous influence on public perceptions and has been actively censoring alternative viewpoints.  Tulsi Now vs. Google  Tulsi Now, Inc. </p><p>vs. Google, LLC[1] was filed on July 25 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The attorneys demand a jury trial and seek compensation and punitive damages of 'no less than $50 million'. Major points and allegations in the 36 page complaint include: Google has monopolistic control of online searches and related advertising. 'Google creates, operates, and controls its platform and services, including but not limited to Google Search, Google Ads, and Gmail as a public forum or its functional equivalent by intentionally and openly dedicating its platform for public use and public benefit, inviting the public to utilize Google as a forum for free speech. Google serves as a state actor by performing an exclusively and traditionally public function by regulating free speech within a public forum and helping to run elections.' (p22)  'Google has used its control over online political speech to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate millions of Americans want to hear from. With this lawsuit, Tulsi seeks to stop Google from further intermeddling in the 2020 United States Presidential Election.. Google plays favorites, with no warning, no transparency - and no accountability (until now).' (p2) At a critical moment Google undercut the Tulsi Gabbard campaign.'On June 28, 2019 - at the height of Gabbard's popularity among internet researchers in the immediate hours after the debate ended, and in the thick of the critical post-debate period Google suspended Tulsi's Google Ads account without warning.' (p3) Google has failed to provide a credible explanation. The Tulsi campaign quickly sought to restore the account but 'In response, the Campaign got opacity and an inconsistent series of answers from Google To this day, Google has not provided a straight answer - let alone a credible one - as to why Tulsi's political speech was silence right when millions of people wanted to hear from her.' (p4) Google started by falsely claiming 'problems with billing'. Later, as reported in the NY Times story[2] a Google spokesperson claimed, 'Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts - including large spending changes - to prevent fraud.In this case, 'our system triggered a suspension.' ' Google has a corporate profit motive to oppose Tulsi Gabbard.'Google has sought to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a presidential candidate who has vocally called for greater regulation and oversight of (you guessed it) Google.' (p5) 'During her career in Congress, Gabbard has moved to limit the powers of big tech companies like Google and has fought to keep the Internet open and available to all. Gabbard has co-sponsored legislation that prohibits multi-tiered pricing agreements for the privileged few, and she has spoken in favor of reinstating and expanding net neutrality to apply to Internet firms like Google.' (p 8)  Google's Actions have caused significant harm to the Gabbard campaign and violate the US and California constitutions and California business law.  'Through its illegal actions targeting Tulsi Gabbard, Google has caused the Campaign significant harm, both monetary (including potentially millions of dollars in forgone donations) and nonmonetary (the ability to provide Tulsi's important message with Americans looking to hear it).' (p6)  'Google engages in a pattern and practice of intentional discrimination in the provision of its services, including discriminating and censoring the Campaign's speech based not on the content of the censored speech but on the Campaign's political identity and viewpoint.' (p27)  The public has an interest in this case.  'Unless the court issues an appropriate injunction, Google's illegal and unconstitutional behavior will continue, harming both the Campaign and the general public, which has an overwhelming interest in a fair, unmanipulated 2020 United States Election cycle. (p 34) Google Explanation is Not Credible The Tulsi Gabbard Google Ads account was abruptly suspended at a crucial time. The question is why. Was it the result of 'unusual activity' triggering an 'automatic suspension' as claimed by Google? Or was it because someone at Google changed the software or otherwise intervened to undermine the Tulsi campaign? Google's explanation of an 'automatic suspension' from 'unusual activity' is dubious. First, the timing does not make sense. The sudden rise in searches on 'Tulsi Gabbard' began the day before the suspension. Gabbard participated in the first debate, on June 26. Her presence and performance sparked interest among many viewers. Next morning, June 27, media reported that, 'Tulsi Gabbard was the most searched candidate on Google after the Democratic debate in Miami'.[3] The second debate took place in the evening of June 27. With discussion of the Democratic candidates continuing, Tulsi Gabbard continued to attract much interest. Around 9:30 pm (ET) on June 27 the Google Ads account was suddenly suspended. If the cause was 'unusual activity', the 'automatic trigger' should have occurred long before.  Second, Google was fully aware of the 'unusual activity'. In fact Google was the source of the news reports on the morning of June 27. Reports said, 'According to Google Trends, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the most searched candidate heading into the debate After the debate, Gabbard vaulted into first.' Third, it is hard to believe that Google does not have any human or more sophisticated review before suspending a major Ads account on a politically intense night. It should have been obvious that the cause of increased interest in Gabbard was the nationally televised Democratic candidates debate and media coverage.  Fourth, the changing explanation for the sudden suspension, starting with a false claim that there were 'problems with billing', raises questions about the integrity of Google's response. Google Secretly Manipulates Public OpinionUnknown to most of the public, there is compelling evidence that Google has been secretly manipulating search results to steer public perception and election voting for years.  Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today, has been studying and reporting on this for the past six years. Recently, on June 16, 2019 he testified[4] before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Constitution. His testimony is titled 'Why Google Poses a Serious Threat to Democracy, and How to End That Threat'.  Epstein has published 15 books and over 300 scientific and mainstream media articles on artificial intelligence and related topics. 'Since 2012, some of my research and writings have focused on Google LLC, specifically on the company's power to suppress content - the censorship problem, if you will - as well as on the massive surveillance the company conducts, and also on the company's unprecedented ability to manipulate the thoughts and behavior of more than 2.5 billion people worldwide.'  As shown by Dr. Epstein, Google uses several techniques to manipulate public opinion. The results of an online search are biased. Search 'suggestions' are skewed. Messages such as 'Go Vote' are sent to some people but not to others.  Epstein's written testimony[5] to Congress includes links to over sixty articles documenting his research published in sites ranging from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to Huffington Post. Epstein's testimony describes 'disturbing findings' including:  'In 2016, biased search results generated by Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton'. (Epstein notes that he supported Clinton.)  'On Election Day in 2018, the 'Go Vote' reminder Google displayed on its home page gave one political party between 800,000 and 4.6 million more votes than it gave the other party.'  'My recent research demonstrates that Google's 'autocomplete' search suggestions can turn a 50/50 split among undecided voters into a 90/10 split without people's awareness.'  'Google has likely been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015. This is because many races are very close and because Google's persuasive technologies are very powerful.' Google is Censoring Alternative Media In August 2017 TruePublica reported their experience and predictions in an article titled 'The Truth War is Being Lost to a Global Censorship Apparatus Called Google'[6]. The article says, '60 percent of people now get their news from search engines, not traditional human editors in the media. It is here where the new information war takes place - the algorithm. Google now takes 81.2 percent of all search engine market share globally. Google has the ability to drive demand and set the narrative, create bias and swing opinion.' In 2017, the World Socialist Web Site (wsws.org) reported[7] that, 'In April, under the guise of combating 'fake news', Google introduced new procedures that give extraordinary powers to unnamed 'evaluators' to demote web pages and websites. These procedures have been used to exclude the WSWS and other antiwar and oppositional sites. Over the past three months, traffic originating from Google to the WSWS has fallen by approximately 70%. In key searches relevant to a wide range of topics the WSWS regularly covers - including the U.S. military operations and the threat of war, social conditions, inequality and even socialism - the number of search impressions has fallen dramatically.' ; In essence, Google has 'de-ranked' and is screening alternative and progressive websites from researchers. WSWS lists many progressive websites along with the dramatic decline in reader visits following the changes at Google. The article includes numerous specific examples such as this one: 'Searches for the term 'Korean war' produced 20,932 impressions in May. In July, searches using the same words produced zero WSWS impressions.'  'The policy guiding these actions is made absolutely clear in the April 25, 2017 blog post by Google's Vice President for Engineering, Ben Gomes, and the updated 'Search Quality Rater Guidelines' published at the same time. The post refers to the need to flag and demote 'unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and conspiracy theories' - broad and amorphous language used to exclude any oppositional content. 'The 'lowest' rating is also to be given to a website that 'presents unsubstantiated conspiracy theories or hoaxes as if the information were factual.''  Tulsi Gabbard has not only called for much stricter regulations on high tech and social media giants. She has also challenged the Democratic Party and foreign policy establishment. In late February 2016 she resigned[8] as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee to support candidate Bernie Sanders against the establishment favorite, Hillary Clinton. Gabbard has issued sharp criticisms of US foreign policy. Recently she said[9], 'We hear a lot of politicians say the same argument that we've got to stay engaged in the world otherwise we'll be isolationists as though the only way the United States can engage with other countries is by blowing them up or strangling them with economic sanctions by smashing them and trying to overthrow their governments. This is exactly what's wrong with this whole premise and the whole view in which too many politicians, too many leaders in this country are viewing the United States role in the world.'ConclusionDid Google take the next step from silently censoring websites the corporation does not like to undercutting a presidential candidate the corporation does not like?  This is a David vs. Goliath story. Google/Alphabet is the 37th largest corporation in the world with enormous political influence in Washington. Whether or not the law suit succeeds, it may serve the public interest by exposing Google's immense monopolistic power and illustrate the need for much more regulation, transparency and accountability. It may also generate more interest in Gabbard's message and campaign in the face of efforts to silence her.  Rick Sterling is an investigative journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This article outlines the main points of the law suit and evidence the the social media giant Google has quietly acquired enormous influence on public perceptions and has been actively censoring alternative viewpoints. Tulsi Now vs Google  Tulsi Now, Inc vs Google, LLC[1] was filed on July 25 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The attorneys demand a jury trial and seek compensation and punitive damages of 'no less than $50 million'. Major points and allegations in the 36 page complaint include: * Google has monopolistic control of online searches and related advertising. </p><p> 'Google creates, operates, and controls its platform and services, including but not limited to Google Search, Google Ads, and Gmail as a public forum or its functional equivalent by intentionally and openly dedicating its platform for public use and public benefit, inviting the public to utilize Google as a forum for free speech. Google serves as a state actor by performing an exclusively and traditionally public function by regulating free speech within a public forum and helping to run elections.' (p. 22) 'Google has used its control over online political speech to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate millions of Americans want to hear from. With this lawsuit, Tulsi seeks to stop Google from further intermeddling in the 2020 United States Presidential Election.. Google plays favorites, with no warning, no transparency - and no accountability (until now).' (p. 2) * At a critical moment Google undercut the Tulsi Gabbard campaign. 'On June 28, 2019 - at the height of Gabbard's popularity among internet researchers in the immediate hours after the debate ended, and in the thick of the critical post-debate period Google suspended Tulsi's Google Ads account without warning.' (p. 3) * Google has failed to provide a credible explanation.  The Tulsi campaign quickly sought to restore the account but 'In response, the Campaign got opacity and an inconsistent series of answers from Google To this day, Google has not provided a straight answer - let alone a credible one - as to why Tulsi's political speech was silence right when millions of people wanted to hear from her.' (p. 4) Google started by falsely claiming 'problems with billing'. Later, as reported in the NY Times story[2] a Google spokesperson claimed, 'Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts - including large spending changes - to prevent fraud.In this case, 'our system triggered a suspension.' ' * Google has a corporate profit motive to oppose Tulsi Gabbard. 'Google has sought to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a presidential candidate who has vocally called for greater regulation and oversight of (you guessed it) Google.' (p. 5) 'During her career in Congress, Gabbard has moved to limit the powers of big tech companies like Google and has fought to keep the internet open and available to all. Gabbard has co-sponsored legislation that prohibits multi-tiered pricing agreements for the privileged few, and she has spoken in favor of reinstating and expanding net neutrality to apply to Internet firms like Google.' (p. 8) * Google's Actions have caused significant harm to the Gabbard campaign and violate the U.S. and California constitutions and California business law.  'Through its illegal actions targeting Tulsi Gabbard, Google has caused the Campaign significant harm, both monetary (including potentially millions of dollars in forgone donations) and nonmonetary (the ability to provide Tulsi's important message with Americans looking to hear it).' (p. 6) 'Google engages in a pattern and practice of intentional discrimination in the provision of its services, including discriminating and censoring the Campaign's speech based not on the content of the censored speech but on the Campaign's political identity and viewpoint.' (p. 27) * The public has an interest in this case.  'Unless the court issues an appropriate injunction, Google's illegal and unconstitutional behavior will continue, harming both the Campaign and the general public, which has an overwhelming interest in a fair, unmanipulated 2020 United States Election cycle. (p. 34) Google Explanation is Not Credible  The Tulsi Gabbard Google Ads account was abruptly suspended at a crucial time. The question is why. Was it the result of 'unusual activity' triggering an 'automatic suspension' as claimed by Google? Or was it because someone at Google changed the software or otherwise intervened to undermine the Tulsi campaign? Google's explanation of an 'automatic suspension' from 'unusual activity' is dubious. First, the timing does not make sense. The sudden rise in searches on 'Tulsi Gabbard' began the day before the suspension. Gabbard participated in the first debate, on June 26. Her presence and performance sparked interest among many viewers. Next morning, June 27, media reported that, 'Tulsi Gabbard was the most searched candidate on Google after the Democratic debate in Miami[3]'. The second debate took place in the evening of June 27. With discussion of the Democratic candidates continuing, Tulsi Gabbard continued to attract much interest. Around 9:30 pm (ET) on June 27 the Google Ads account was suddenly suspended. If the cause was 'unusual activity', the 'automatic trigger' should have occurred long before. Second, Google was fully aware of the 'unusual activity'. In fact, Google was the source of the news reports on the morning of June 27. Reports said: 'According to Google Trends, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the most searched candidate heading into the debate After the debate, Gabbard vaulted into first.' Third, it is hard to believe that Google does not have any human or more sophisticated review before suspending a major Ads account on a politically intense night. It should have been obvious that the cause of increased interest in Gabbard was the nationally televised Democratic candidates debate and media coverage. Fourth, the changing explanation for the sudden suspension, starting with a false claim that there were 'problems with billing', raises questions about the integrity of Google's response. Google Secretly Manipulates Public Opinion Unknown to most of the public, there is compelling evidence that Google has been secretly manipulating search results to steer public perception and election voting for years. Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today, has been studying and reporting on this for the past six years. Recently, on June 16, 2019 he testified[4] before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Constitution. His testimony is titled 'Why Google Poses a Serious Threat to Democracy, and How to End That Threat'. Epstein has published 15 books and over 300 scientific and mainstream media articles on artificial intelligence and related topics. 'Since 2012, some of my research and writings have focused on Google LLC, specifically on the company's power to suppress content - the censorship problem, if you will - as well as on the massive surveillance the company conducts, and also on the company's unprecedented ability to manipulate the thoughts and behavior of more than 2.5 billion people worldwide.' As shown by Dr. Epstein, Google uses several techniques to manipulate public opinion. The results of an online search are biased. Search 'suggestions' are skewed. Messages such as 'Go Vote' are sent to some people but not to others. Epstein's written testimony[5] to Congress includes links to over sixty articles documenting his research published in sites ranging from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to Huffington Post. Epstein's testimony describes 'disturbing findings' including: 'In 2016, biased search results generated by Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that gave at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton'. (Epstein notes that he supported Clinton.) 'On Election Day in 2018, the 'Go Vote' reminder Google displayed on its home page gave one political party between 800,000 and 4.6 million more votes than it gave the other party.' 'My recent research demonstrates that Google's 'autocomplete' search suggestions can turn a 50/50 split among undecided voters into a 90/10 split without people's awareness.' 'Google has likely been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide since at least 2015. This is because many races are very close and because Google's persuasive technologies are very powerful.' Google is Censoring Alternative Media  In August 2017 TruePublica reported their experience and predictions in an article titled 'The Truth War is Being Lost to a Global Censorship Apparatus Called Google[6]'. The article says: 60 percent of people now get their news from search engines, not traditional human editors in the media. It is here where the new information war takes place - the algorithm. Google now takes 81.2 percent of all search engine market share globally. Google has the ability to drive demand and set the narrative, create bias and swing opinion. In 2017, the World Socialist Web Site (wsws.org) reported[7] that: In April, under the guise of combating 'fake news', Google introduced new procedures that give extraordinary powers to unnamed 'evaluators' to demote web pages and websites. These procedures have been used to exclude the WSWS and other anti-war and oppositional sites. Over the past three months, traffic originating from Google to the WSWS has fallen by approximately 70%. In key searches relevant to a wide range of topics the WSWS regularly covers - including the U.S. military operations and the threat of war, social conditions, inequality and even socialism - the number of search impressions has fallen dramatically. In essence, Google has 'de-ranked' and is screening searchers from seeing alternative and progressive websites such as truepublica, globalresearch, consortiumnews, commondreams, Wikileaks, truth-out and many more. WSWS reported numerous specific examples such as this one: 'Searches for the term 'Korean war' produced 20,932 impressions in May. In July, searches using the same words produced zero WSWS impressions.' 'The policy guiding these actions is made absolutely clear in the April 25, 2017 blog post by Google's Vice President for Engineering, Ben Gomes, and the updated 'Search Quality Rater Guidelines' published at the same time. The post refers to the need to flag and demote 'unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and conspiracy theories' - broad and amorphous language used to exclude any oppositional content. 'The 'lowest' rating is also to be given to a website that 'presents unsubstantiated conspiracy theories or hoaxes as if the information were factual.'' Tulsi Gabbard has not only called for much stricter regulations on high tech and social media giants. She has also challenged the Democratic Party and foreign policy establishment. In late February 2016 she resigned[8] as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee to support candidate Bernie Sanders against the establishment favorite, Hillary Clinton. Gabbard has issued sharp criticisms of US foreign policy. Recently she said[9]: We hear a lot of politicians say the same argument that we've got to stay engaged in the world otherwise we'll be isolationists as though the only way the United States can engage with other countries is by blowing them up or strangling them with economic sanctions by smashing them and trying to overthrow their governments. This is exactly what's wrong with this whole premise and the whole view in which too many politicians, too many leaders in this country are viewing the United States role in the world. Conclusion Did Google take the next step from silently censoring websites the corporation does not like to undercutting a presidential candidate the corporation does not like? This is a David vs Goliath story. Google/Alphabet is the 37th largest corporation in the world with enormous political influence in Washington. Whether or not the law suit succeeds, it may serve the public interest by exposing Google's immense monopolistic power and illustrate the need for much more regulation, transparency and accountability. It may also generate more interest in Gabbard's message and campaign in the face of efforts to silence her.

All that kind of stuff. So confidence is key. So therefore, if people get nervous, they oversell. If they get overly confident, they buy too much, and so as exchange rates go, as stock markets go, things tend to move up and down, but on the whole, in the end of the day, there's equil... what we call in economics, equilibrium. Things level out, and...</p><p>DUFFY: Now in the United States, we saw mortgage companies, and some of them are in very deep trouble, giving mortgages, I read somewhere, some guy in jail got a mortgage on a big house. How was he going to pay the mortgage from jail? He didn't have a job. He couldn't go to work, and yet the greed of that market at that time in that housing bubble allowed that to happen, but it didn't happen here, why?</p><p>CURTIS: We admire, often, the risk taking that Americans take. We always complain about ourselves being a little too cautious, a little risk averse. In fact, as history is showing us, it's not too bad to be a little on the cautious side. We would, that person would not have got a loan of that sort in Canada.</p><p>DUFFY: Because our rules are stronger. Our banks are more conservative, and the superintendent of financial insists...</p><p>CURTIS: All that, and our culture is a little more cautious, if I can use those terms. We just don't gamble so much as the Americans do, and, so therefore, as I say, we didn't have the big tech boom that they had in the end of the '90s, so we didn't go as high as the American economy went. On the other hand, we're not going to go as low as they go when things start to unwind very quickly.</p><p>DUFFY: So when people are sitting home tonight watching \"Mike Duffy Live\" and wondering about their RRSPs, and all of that stuff, what's your advice?</p><p>CURTIS: Hang on. It's going to, it's going to turn around. In fact, probably within the next few weeks, you'll see things being turned around. The American dollar has already turned around, as we've seen over the last month. There'll be stability built back into the, the market, and this is in fact a good time to start buying, the financial assets. If you buy low...</p><p>DUFFY: If you've spare cash.</p><p>CURTIS: Exactly. So, it is a worry. I mean, we can't underestimate it. This is something that your parents, my parents and our grandparents went through in the '30s, but governments know more what to do. International institutions are out there, which they weren't before. People around the world in institutions deal with each other now much better than before. People aren't putting up trade barriers in response to these financial troubles. The governments getting involved, even the free enterprise American government. We have good regulation. So in fact, it's going to stabilize.</p><p>DUFFY: It's a safer world.</p><p>CURTIS: It's a safer world.</p><p>DUFFY: Interesting to see the free enterprise American government with one, running such a huge deficit, and two, bailing out financial firms that should know better, but that's their political agenda.</p><p>CURTIS: All politics are local, Mike.</p><p>DUFFY: That's it.</p><p>CURTIS: Yeah.</p><p>DUFFY: Thank you very much. John Curtis, a financial expert. Great to have you in, and we'll have you back often as this unfolds, and I'll hold you to it. It's all going to come back, so don't panic.</p><p>CURTIS: Exactly.</p><p>DUFFY: Right on.</p><p>CURTIS: Thank you, Mike.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTV2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TH4-8G90-TX7B-W017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 CTV Televisions, Inc.

The worry now that it could lead to the turf battles that defined the intel world prior to 9/11. And here's why. We're told the CIA and FBI cannot agree on a motive for this hacking. The CIA reportedly believes Russia tried to get Trump elected; the FBI won't go quite that far. And this has lawmakers on both sides of the aisle very upset.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here with more, he knows how the world really works. It's Bryan Suits, KFI AM 640 radio host in Los Angeles. It's the dark secret place. Great show. Bryan is also a combat war veteran from Iraq and Bosnia. Bryan, welcome back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRYAN SUITS, RADIO HOST, KFI AM: It's beginning to look a lot like Chris Nukka (ph) out here.</p><p>KENNEDY: I don't know what that means, but it's probably funny. So let's talk a little bit about the CIA. CIA says we know the motive Russia wanted to get Trump elected. The FBI says the evidence is quote, fuzzy and ambiguous. Why the disagreement between law enforcement and intelligence?</p><p>SUITS: Well, the CIA should have said they wanted disruption in the election process, because that is what the Russians sought and that's what they achieved. The FBI's culture is a investigative law enforcement culture. They need to line up all the ducks in a row and hand it to a prosecutor who then goes 12 and 0 with a jury. They don't have a disinformation branch of the FBI. They're the opposite of disinformation which would be information.</p><p>The CIA is one of their primary functions, and I know as an information operations guy in Iraq, in general, we were instructed to tell the truth. Personally of my own volition, I planted disinformation in 2005 by saying things like, Muqtada al-Sadr was on the CIA payroll, things like that. It was on me, just me. I'll take the hit on that. But that's the difference.</p><p>The CIA is an intelligence agency, including some counterintelligence functions. The FBI, by the way, their job -- if this is going on in the U.S. or externally and it's targeting the U.S., the FBI, one of their key functions is counterintelligence, and they missed it.</p><p>KENNEDY: So why should we believe the CIA? If part of their job is disinformation, why should we automatically believe them?</p><p>SUITS: I think because of the outcome. What we have with here is the largest political divide in our lifetimes, probably within 100 years --</p><p>KENNEDY: OK, well let's talk about the outcome, because this is something that I think is really important to address. There's a big difference between hacking e-mails and putting out fake news and actually screwing around with votes and voting machines.</p><p>SUITS: Yes, and this is where --</p><p>KENNEDY: And there's a natural assumption that somehow if there was disruption, that it affected the vote. But it may have only affected perception, but people have the free will to choose whichever candidate they want.</p><p>SUITS: Yes, and that's why the CIA and the Democrats need to stop saying hack, hack, hack. It was disruption. The SVR, the Russians weaponized ignorance, and you got people who were politically active for the first time in their life who don't know the difference between Sputnik International and Drudge or CNN or BBC, and that was the key. And by the way, the Democrats --</p><p>KENNEDY: But was it, though? Do you really think there were enough people who were influenced by fake news stories to change the electoral outcome of the election? That's my ultimate question --</p><p>SUITS: I don't.</p><p>KENNEDY: -- because I think in some ways that's really disingenuous and insulting to voters.</p><p>SUITS: Yes. No, I don't, but I do think that there was a critical mass of people maybe just in the bubble who were either rejecting Hillary because of fake things, besides her just being a loathsome person --</p><p>KENNEDY: But there were plenty of real things in the foier (ph), the outcomes in the e-mail server scandal.</p><p>SUITS: Yes. But I mean when you have something under its own momentum that gets a guy to come to a pizza restaurant. You know, there was a real issue. And part of the thing is this has nothing to do with doing anything illegal. It's perfectly legal to put up a fake website or to influence the American voters.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>SUITS: People -- Americans need to be cognizant of the fact that in 2011, Putin blames us for political instability after their election.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>SUITS: So turn about is fair play. This has been on his plate for five years.</p><p>KENNEDY: And it's also not the first time that Russia has caused disruption in elections outside their country. The question is, does it affect the outcome of the race? At this point I don't see enough evidence that it does. I don't have a problem with there being a congressional investigation, but I think it's premature to come to those massive and hysterical conclusions. Last word.</p><p>SUITS: Yes, no, I agree. And if the Democrats Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation go without mentioning that somebody externally messed with a private organization called a political party in America, if they -- if that came and went, they discouraged all those Bernie voters, then that's on them.</p><p>By the way, if the Republicans think that by 6 p.m. on January 20, the Reince Priebus to Jeb Bush <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>oppo research doesn't get released, then they're really naive about who this guy is, Putin.</p><p>KENNEDY: I love naivete. Bryan Suits, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to take a chain saw to tax rates, but Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell, </nameText></person>he's pushing back. We'll tell you why some Republicans are fighting against tax cuts. Brian Brenberg breaks it down in moments.</p><p>KENNEDY: Maybe they're going home because they're on strike because they're communists. Thank you, Weezer.</p><p>Welcome back. President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tax cut plan looks to be heading for a big showdown on Capitol Hill, but this time not only with Democrats but Republicans too. Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>last night said he does not want any tax cuts to add to the deficit, and that could pour some cold water on one of Trump's biggest campaign promises, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to fix the nation's roads and bridges.</p><p>So how do you pay for all those things while also cutting taxes? There's only one man who can break it down for us. That's Brian Brenberg. He's the Associate Professor of Business and Economics, Chair of the Program in Business and Finance at the Kings College. This is Brianomics.</p><p>So we all want great roads. We all want neat stuff. We all want tax cuts. This President-elect does not want to cut military spending or entitlement spending. We've talked about this a little bit before. Do you share <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell's </nameText></person>reservations?</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, KINGS COLLEGE: I am so glad that <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>is saying this. Look, people are saying this is bad news and it's a fight between the president and Congress. No, this is actually really good news. What McConnell's saying is, we want to get tax cuts done, and it's only going to happen if we do it responsibly, if we pay for it, because we're not going to pass $5 trillion more in debt onto our children. So I actually like that he's saying this because he wants to get something done. He wants to get it done quick. He wants to get even some bipartisan participation on this. So he's saying, let's find a way to do it.</p><p>LISA KENNEDY, HOST: Well how do you that? How do you make it revenue neutral?</p><p>BRENBERG: Well one, OK - -</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, that's what's McConnell's talking about.</p><p>BRENBERG: No. You have to be careful here, because when Republicans say revenue neutral, they're also saying, look, we know that when you cut taxes you're going to spur growth. When you spur growth, more tax revenue is going to come in.</p><p>KENNEDY: So they're just going to go ahead and spend the new taxes.</p><p>BRENBERG: Well, it's - - what - - they're saying there's going to be some revenue feedback here. But the other thing you have to do, you have to reform spending and you have to go after entitlements. There's just no other way to do it. Trump did not want to talk about on the campaign trail. I like that McConnell is pushing him in that direction. I think Paul Ryan's going to push him in that direction. And I think they're going to say to him, look, if you're the negotiator-in-chief, here's your next job. You've got to negotiate with the American people.</p><p>KENNEDY: Sure.</p><p>BRENBERG: You're going to negotiate with the Democrats in Congress. You've got to help us find a way to get some spending reform done as well.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, it - - it's interesting because we may be also headed for a personal showdown. Because <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell's </nameText></person>wife is the nominee to be Secretary of Transportation, and she will be in charge of this $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan that Republicans and Libertarians laughed at Bernie Sanders for floating.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. And - - and look, there's some real problems with that. I've come on here and said this before. I'm weary of big infrastructure spending, even when we talk about it being funded by the private sector which Trump is saying - -</p><p>KENNEDY: (Inaudible) because if there's tax hand outs and subsidies - -</p><p>BRENBERG: There are a lot of details there that we haven't seen and at the end of the day the government's going to be on the hook for this. I agree there's going to be a showdown there. But again, I think McConnell and Ryan can push Trump to look at some long term entitlements spending reform that can give him a little bit of room to breathe when it comes to these tax cuts. I'm not a big fan of infrastructure, but it might also give him some room to breathe in infrastructure as well.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Well he - - he may have to pear down his wish list on infrastructure spending.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. Yes, exactly.</p><p>KENNEDY: And most certainly have to cut entitlement and military spending. And at the same time, they have to figure out how to service that debt. Because, we cannot have the debt double under this incoming president the way it did under Obama and Bush the younger.</p><p>BRENBERG: No. I mean, Trump is inheriting deficits are going to rise to over $1 trillion in just a few years. And - - and you know, his tax plan right now, again, if you don't look at this, the revenue that might come in because he's cutting taxes. It adds $5 trillion to the debt, so you're right. You're talking about over the next 10 years, potentially worst case scenario, $15 trillion more in debt added. It's - - it's immoral to pass that on to our children. We absolutely cannot do that. That's why it's imperative from Trump to work with Ryan, work with McConnell and reform spending, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you've also called it a huge social justice issue. The debt burden that we've got, which we will touch on another day. Merry Christmas Brian Brenberg. I know you are off with your family very soon. So thank you for a year of insight, intelligence and Brianonimcs (ph).</p><p>BRENBERG: It was my pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thanks man. All right, coming up a new study says, we can predict that toddlers will grow up to be productive citizens or total criminals. And if it's true, do we really want that kind of power?</p><p>The party panel, we'll let the parents here. We're going to all hash it out next.</p><p>KENNEDY: We're all clapping down here, party people. Welcome back.</p><p>When stashing away funds for your child's future, it's important to know whether you'll need college tuition or bail money. In a study conducted by Duke University and King's College of London, tests done on children at a very young age, just three years old, can determine whether they will turn to a life of crime in their older years. The procedure is examine the child's language and motor skills, as well as frustration, tolerance and impulsivity. So can we save our society by putting these troubled toddlers behind bars. The party panel is back. Katherine Mangu-Ward, Andy Levy, and Julie Banderas.</p><p>All right Julie, you've got three children, congratulations. Which one is the criminal?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JULIE BANDERAS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Oh, definitely the middle child.</p><p>KENNEDY: Nice.</p><p>BANDERAS: She's three. And so, when I think about this, she just turned four, but they test frustration tolerance. No three and a half year old has tolerance for anything. And then restlessness and impulsivity, I can't get her to sit still long enough to take a test like this. So she's definitely the, she'll be in prison at some point. But I'm not sure I buy into this test. I just don't know how much you can actually test a three year old.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well they tested thousands of people in New Zealand over the course of several decades. And followed their lives and figured out health records and criminal and welfare records. And they noted that - that the 20 percent of society, who tends to use 80 percent of societies public resources, they're the ones who essentially failed the test. What does it say to you?</p><p>ANDY LEVY, CO-HOST FNC RED EYE WITH GREG GUTFELD: Well, look, it sounds absurd - - at first I thought it sounded absurd. I thought it sounded scary. It sounded like some sort of Gattica type thing, where we're going to, you know, genetically test kids at the age of three and determine their life.</p><p>KENNEDY: But it's not - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: And that's the thing. The point that I - - that I latched on to was they said, researchers concluded that low cognitive test scores for skills such as language indicated less developed brains. Possibly caused by too little stimulation in their early life. In other words, this isn't all we've discovered a method to determine which three year olds are worthless. It's a - - we've developed a method that shows how we might, you know, get these kids on a path towards not becoming criminals or a drain on society.</p><p>KENNEDY: And future children, maybe you stimulate them in this way parent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, there's an upside here. There's always an upside for the eternal optimist that is Katherine Mangu-Ward.</p><p>KATHERINE MANGU-WARD, EDITOR IN CHIEF, REASON MAGAZINE: That's true. No. Actually in this case, I also have a three year old and so I, of course went clicking on this link before I even read the rest of the headline. So my thing is that, even if there is some kind of health upshot, the public policy upshot is almost certainly disastrous. If we're doing something early on and then categorizing people in any official capacity as the probable consumers of social services, in the form of prison and disability, whatever. It - - it, like, that doesn't end well, that story doesn't end well. That story (inaudible), you're right to go full, like science fiction dystopia on that.</p><p>KENNEDY: What happens if you get some sort of mark, in a public medical file? And all our medical files - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: - - are going to be made public once we - -</p><p>WARD: No problem at all.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: Give people a sub-par designation.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Yes. This person has a greater likelihood of being a drain on society.</p><p>WARD: And I think the framing is what really actually raises the red flag for me. The idea that they initially set out to investigate this idea about the cradle principle of the 80/20 principle. You know, if it's - - if this is about who's using up the resources. That, to sort of approach it from that perspective, I think it's a very different thing to say, hey should we tell parents.</p><p>KENNEDY: I have my own 80/20 principle and that is eat 80 percent of your calories in the first 20 percent of the day. Many of today's teens, they don't have the munchies so they don't eat like that.</p><p>WARD: I don't either.</p><p>KENNEDY: But they will certainly have more time for crime, because they seem to be putting down the bottle, the butts and the bongs. Alcohol, drug and cigarette use amongst most American teens at an all time low. And, of course, this is a good sign for our nation's future. Or, could we be led by a bunch of nerds when we're old people.</p><p>Julie, it used to be that the teenagers, they were smoking grass. They were stealing their parents hooch.</p><p>BANDERAS: Are you speaking for yourself, or just in general?</p><p>KENNEDY: Like totally general. It's not a thing - -</p><p>BANDERAS: Because that time that my mom didn't walk on me, walk in to my bedrooms smoking a bong. That didn't happen. But she ended up actually taking it to the police station because she didn't know what it was. I said I was smoking tobacco and she told the cops. And she's like, my daughter, this was in her, and they looked at her and they laughed and confiscated it. That didn't happen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANDERAS: I think that honestly to just more intense helicopter parenting, like me. I have webcams in my kids rooms. And I will put chips, microchips under their necks when they start to leave the home.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: OK. All this stuff is so purported. So, we don't know if they're smoking, drinking or doing drugs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: Or it could be also that President-elect Trump is already getting results.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's right.</p><p>LEVY: So we don't know.</p><p>KENNEDY: Just say niegn (ph).</p><p>LEVY: Exactly.</p><p>WARD: I'm thrilled that American teenagers are lame. But I think it's pretty obvious that they're just substituting, like, Snapchat for smoking. Right? So anytime that someone's starts to feel like, ah, I'm really worried about screen time. No. Far better screen time than any of the alternatives.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Opiod addiction.</p><p>LEVY: I do think also, you should wait until you're an adult to start numbing yourself from the effects of life. I mean, just, you know, be an adult and then yes. Just - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, do you have anything to numb the effects?</p><p>LEVY: The show's almost over right?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>LEVY: Yay, we'll talk in a minute.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVY: What you need? What you need?</p><p>KENNEDY: Whatever you got baby. Julie, Andy and Katherine, thank you so much as Katherine looks to the heavens.</p><p>WARD: There's no help for me there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KENNEDY: Coming up, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>today met with Kanye West. Tomorrow he's meeting with the giants of the tech sector. What the President-elect has up his sleeve, Peter Suderman, computer man explains in a moment.</p><p>KENNEDY: No, another surreal moment in the Trump transition, when the President-elect hugged it out with rapper Kanye West. Look at them. After the two of them had a closed door meeting in Trump Tower, according to E!, they discussed \"Jeezy\" becoming some kind of entrepreneurial ambassador.</p><p>Well tomorrow Apple and other tech giants are going to meet with the President-elect at Trump Tower. You might recall, that during the campaign, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>chastised Apple for outsourcing jobs to China and refusing to work with intelligence agencies to break their encryption codes. Will the computer moguls find common ground with Trump? Let me ask Peter Suderman, Reason Magazine's features editor and he's also the author of this segment, Suderman, Computerman. Peter, welcome back.</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN, EDITOR REASON MAGAZINE: Glad to be here. Thanks for having me.</p><p>KENNEDY: So will Kanye West be the Ambassador to Italy? The post that Chris Christie's seems to have thumbed his nose at.</p><p>SUDERMAN: I mean, what do we know about Kanye West is that he shops so much. He can speak Italian, so I think he's really a great candidate here. What do you think <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>favorite Kanye West album is? Probably not \"808's and Heartbreak\" I'm thinking. But look, this is the kind of thing that we're going to see in the Trump Administration. Trump is, he is a TV star. He's a pop star. He's somebody who sort of hangs out in these weird worlds and he's going to combine these things in ways we're kind of not used to seeing.</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, certainly. No. I think it's fascinating. I think that what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is orchestrating at Trump Tower, you never know who's coming or going. It's like this ongoing party scene from \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", and it's the most curious mix of people.</p><p>Now, speaking of curious mix, he's going to have Tim Cook, Sheryl Sandberg, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, who he's been very critical of, all coming to Trump Tower for this big tech symposium. What are they possibly going to cover? There's a lot of animosity both ways. Will they be able to bridge the gap?</p><p>SUDERMAN: I mean, this is an olive branch on the part of the tech community, which was quite critical, I mean in terms of both of the companies themselves. But really even the staffers, the kinds of people who work for these big tech companies are just not going to be <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>fans as a general rule. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was in, for his part, really quite critical of a bunch of these companies.</p><p>Apple, as you said and in particular he went after Jeff Bezos, the, who also owns the Washington Post, accused him of using the Washington Post to influence getting lower tax rates and to cover him in ways that Trump said were bad and irresponsible. But the thing is, these companies are, make up a huge part of the economy and they are really highly regulated. They are really dependent on, as a direction of how government regulations and how they go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: - - taxes, trade, manufacturing. But I think what it really comes down to is who runs the world? And I think that's what they're going to fight over. So, I will pose that question to you, between the tech moguls and <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Who runs the world?</p><p>SUDERMAN: Well <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>certainly thinks he runs the world, and would like to, would like everyone else to think that. And, you know, I hope that the results of this is - - is that that it's not quite the case and that we actually end up in a - - in a - - a world that is a little more driven by individual choices using things like technology. And I really, I mean, honestly I feel like this is necessary given all the business that these companies have that is up for, kind of, grabs for being messed with by the administration, by the government.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>SUDERMAN: But it's really unfortunate. Because we are now sort of - -</p><p>KENNEDY: This will be - -</p><p>SUDERMAN: - - a situation in which corporations have to work with the government, have to, kind of, go and beg for indulgences from the President of the United States in order to get their business done.</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, it's like the old school church, before the great schism. Peter Suderman, thank you very much for your insight.</p><p>SUDERMAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>KENNEDY: I hear technology is the future.</p><p>Coming up, are teddy bears doing too much ecstasy at dance parties? Or not enough? Find out the proper dosage in the Topical Storm, next.</p><p>KENNEDY: When your cabin is besot. Besot I say, with gremlins, come to me and I'll domesticate them and teach them how to fetch newspapers. This is the Topical Storm, your haven for weird news.</p><p>Topic number one, we all know the old adage, a healthy teddy bear is a happy teddy bear. Just watch this little guy break some moves.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: A lot of people assume teddy bears have to jog to stay fit, but dancing actually burns quite a few calories too. Plus dancing is a skill your teddy can learn and improve upon for the rest of his life. So be sure to feed your teddy bear a diet rich in Omega 3 and fatty acids, and avoid sugar and fried foods. Because then, your teddy bear might have to get open heart surgery.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KENNEDY: (Inaudible)</p><p>Topic number two. The fresh smell of winter is a magical moment for pets who find their world coated in a blanket of frozen weirdness.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Dog nails him. Show it again. Good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KENNEDY: That is such a good dog. Oh, don't worry, the cat found peace and seclusion away from the dog up on a beautiful mountain.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: It was a beautiful \"meowtain\". Get it?</p><p>Topic number three. This is a Fox Business breaking news alert. We have some fresh video from Senator John McCain and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. They're meeting on Capital Hill as we speak. Those inside the meeting said McCain was a real baby, but stood up to corporative dinosaur Tillerson. Let's watch.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: See, they see eye to eye. I know, I know it's evening and I have the up most respect for Senator McCain. But wearing onesie jammies to such an emposium sort of lacks decorum. A lot of big feelings in that room. It's going to be what it's like on Capital Hill. I can't wait.</p><p>Topic number four. Nothing says Christmas quite like coming together with your loved ones, sharing the warmth of the season and basking in the glow of the Yule log on a glorious HD surround sound environment. But hey, drift less hobo's celebrate the holidays too. Let's not be hoboist. And that's why this year we have substituted, substituted the Yule log with a soothing dumpster.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Great description for this election season. It really was a dumpster fire, and it is the reason for the season. But there's no need to fear for all you pyrophobes out there. We've got our Santa Tracker 3000 working overtime and it appears Santa's annual fire truck tour through rural America has brought him to the dumpster to extinguish the flames at this very moment. Let's check in with him now to see how his night is progressing. Santa?</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Sorry you had to see that. It's OK. He pulled himself out with his own wee. And that we cannot show on a family broadcast. Though I'm going to watch it later for a few hours.</p><p>Topic number five. I love Star Wars, and I have a French bulldog. So this one is really for me. You know Rogue One is coming out Friday. So allow me to present Rogue Two, a pair of French bulldogs who are baffled by a Star Wars icon, watch.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: They want to like Yoda, because they know the Jedi master is essentially a French bulldog. Look at those pointy ears, flat face and wrinkled forehead. But the dogs are all, what's up with the bi peedles (ph) and the green wand old midget Harry Potter? Yes. I wish they'd torn him limb from limb. I love Yoda, he's my favorite character, but still it would be pretty good to see. It's a fake Yoda.</p><p>Well let's check in with my dog Lemmy (ph), and see if he likes Star Wars. There's Lemmy (ph) and Zucchini (ph) with a great thing ding. Thing a ling, a ding, ding , ding dong. Fly paper. You know the force is strong with that one. His mediclorions (ph) are off the charts.</p><p>Thank you so much for watching the show tonight.

It's Kennedyfbn, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Kennedyfbn@foxbusiness.com\">Kennedyfbn@foxbusiness.com</email> use hash tag \"Topical Storm\".</p><p>Airing tomorrow night on the show.

As per the assessments made through the course of the investigation, ACGM explains that Facebook was fined due to the its conducts listed below, which are alleged to be in contradiction with the said articles of the Consumer Code:</p><p> Misleading the users in the sign-up process via a failure to explicitly indicate the purpose of data collection and specifying that the collected items would be utilized for commercial means by Facebook.Incentivizing the users to make decisions of a commercial nature without being granted access to the full facts, namely the profitable ends that could be achieved by Facebook via providing social network services to users.Undertaking an aggressive practice on registered users of Facebook by transmitting their data from the network to third parties and vice versa for achieving commercial purposes.</p><p>With regards to the concerns about Article 21 and 22 of the Consumer Code, AGCM focuses on Facebook's misleading conduct against its users during the account creation phase. AGCM points out that while the data required from Facebook users for the sign-up process is used for commercial purposes, Facebook do not provide adequate and immediate information to its users in relation with this purpose. Accordingly, AGCM sets forth that Facebook places an emphasis on the free nature of the services to induce its users to make a commercial decision that they would not have made otherwise, instead of revealing to the customers the commercial objectives underlying the provision of social network services. More specifically, Facebook's practice of emphasizing the \"free of charge\" nature of the social network services, is deemed as a misleading conduct that manipulates user decisions. Furthermore, AGCM has established that information provided by Facebook do not include a distinction per the functionality of the data collected and that it is incomplete. For instance, it is noted that Facebook do not inform its users whether the data would be used to personalize the network services or for advertising campaigns aimed at specific targets.</p><p>In relation with the assessment made on Articles 24 and 25 of the Consumer Code, AGCM focuses on Facebook's conduct which is described as \"aggressive practices\", directed towards the registered consumers. Within this scope, AGCM expresses that the data obtained from the registered customers were being transmitted to third party websites or apps and vice versa for commercial purposes, without obtaining express and prior consent.  Hence, by making its \"active platform\" function default, Facebook pre-sets its users' ability to access websites and external apps that use their Facebook accounts without their express consent. Accordingly, Facebook repeats the pre-selection mechanism whenever the user accesses a third-party website or an app, which is integrated with his or her Facebook account and merely provides an opt-out option. Considering the nature of this mechanism, AGCM indicated that Facebook's conduct induces unconscious and automatic consumer choice, on the ground that customers are not required to give an express and prior consent for data transmission.</p><p>In further assessment, such conduct is characterized as an \"undue influence\", which stems from the pre-selection mechanism that ensures the broadest consumer consent to data sharing. AGCM ultimately establishes that, although registered consumers may limit their consent regarding the scope of data sharing, they are exposed to significant restrictions concerning the use of the social network, third-party websites and apps in a way that disincentivizes any potential variations of the pre-selected choice.</p><p>Considering the foregoing, AGCM published a press release notifying that the investigation is concluded on 29 November 2018. In the press release it is declared that Facebook was fined 10 million Euros by AGCM for data misuse and that it was obliged to publish a correction statement on its app and website<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes\">http://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers%E2%80%99-data-for-commercial-purposes</url></p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>It is noteworthy to mention that it is not the first time that Facebook got in trouble with data protection rules. The company has previously been exposed to investigations in Ireland and the UK, with concerns regarding data protection rules. On 24 September 2018, Facebook engineers discovered that hackers were able to take over users' accounts and this led to a major scandal affecting nearly 50 million Facebook accounts. Consequently, the Irish Data Protection Commission initiated an investigation to examine whether Facebook complies with its obligations under General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\")<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/facebook-data-breach-social-network-could-face-eu-fine.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/facebook-data-breach-social-network-could-face-eu-fine.html</url></p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>Facebook stated in its press releases that they were cooperating with the Irish Data Protection Commission since they realized such a security attack, the company has also been conducting an internal investigation and \"continued to take remedial actions to mitigate the potential risks to users\". In the wake of the Irish Data Protection Commission's announcement concerning the investigation, the Spanish Data Protection Agency stated that it would collaborate on the investigation for the rights of the Spanish citizens<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/facebook-data-breach-latest-fine-investigation\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/facebook-data-breach-latest-fine-investigation</url></p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>According to the GDPR, companies who fail to adequately protect relevant data could be fined for 20 million Euros or 4% of their global annual revenue from prior year, depending on which amount is greater. However, companies who notify the violation within three days will benefit from a reduction amounting to 2% of their global revenue. In this regard, the Irish Data Protection Commission reported that Facebook notified the breach on time to benefit from such reduction<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-eu-fine-163-billion-massive-data-breach-50-million-users-2018-10\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-eu-fine-163-billion-massive-data-breach-50-million-users-2018-10</url></p></bodyText></footnote>. The investigation is not concluded yet and the potential fine that Facebook might face is estimated as $1.63bn, which is a considerable amount. The investigation is also crucial as it is considered as the first major test of Europe's new rules<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-potential-1-63-billion-fine-in-europe-over-data-breach-1538330906\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-potential-1-63-billion-fine-in-europe-over-data-breach-1538330906</url></p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>In the UK, Facebook was fined for 500.000 GBP on 25 October 2018, when old data privacy rules of the EU were still in force, which allowed for a maximum amount of fine of 500,000 GBP by Information Commissioner's Office (\"ICO\"). In the UK case, Facebook was penalized for unlawfully processing personal information of its users between 2007 and 2014, without obtaining sufficiently clear and informed consent. The fine imposed by ICO was also justified by Facebook's failure to keep its users' personal information secure, which meant that the personal data of 87 million Facebook users located in the UK, US and other countries were shared with a third-party company named GSR. It was determined that GSR later shared a subset of the data with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica - a company involved in political campaigning in the United States. Within this context, ICO established that Facebook had failed to take adequate and timely remedial action, involving deletion, despite the fact that it discovered such misuse of data in 2015 and it did not suspend the company from its platform until the year of 2018.</p><p>To wrap up, AGCM's recent decision on Facebook appears to be the latest indicator that signifies competition and data protection enforcers' tendency to scrutinize big technology companies over data-related conducts. Thus, it seems that the big-tech companies have much to expect and learn from competition and data protection authorities all over the world.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>America's allies, the Syrian Kurds are now suspending their war against ISIS in order to focus on defending themselves against Turkey's invasion. They have vowed to defend themselves to the last man and woman and they've called on civilians to form a human shield.</p><p>Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AHMED MOUSSA, COMMANDER, HASAKEH PROVINCE LOCAL MILITARY COUNCILS (through translator): We say that now our people that made so many sacrifices in the past, today we'll also be ready to sacrifice themselves in order to block attacks by Turkey.

Just hours after the statement, Turkey did begin its military assault on Northern Syria. President Erdogan announced it on Twitter and war jets quickly took to the skies despite the U.S. having warned that it would close that air space. Witnesses report hundreds of civilians immediately began fleeing to the Turkish border.</p><p>The move comes days after President Donald Trump began withdrawing American forces from the area decrying, quote, endless wars. The Turkish Government bitterly oppose to the Kurds says the assault is necessary for their own security.</p><p>Now, Gulnur Aybet is a senior adviser to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and she's joining me now from the capital Ankara. Welcome to the program, Gulnur Aybet. Welcome back to our program.</p><p>Let me start by asking you --</p><p>GULNUR AYBET, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY: Hello.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- are you prepared for what might, in fact, be a massacre, if, indeed, civilians are being called, as you heard, to protect and defend in a human shield against your forces?</p><p>AYBET: Well, Christiane, there's so much misinformation about this operation, this Operation Peace Spring that we've just undertaken. Turkey is the only actor in the region with the largest border with Syria. And from the very beginning, we're the only actor in the region who's had a consistent policy toward Syria. And that is consisted of two parts.</p><p>Firstly, we said we would never allow a terror corridor to form on our border. And secondly, that we would establish a safe zone for the return of Syrian refugees of four million which we host in our country.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>AYBET: And we've consistently said that this is our policy and now the time has come to implement this policy and we have tried to implement that policy working with regional countries and with our allies buy it has not worked out. And at the end, we had to take matters in our own hands.</p><p>But when I said about the misinformation, I'd also like to point out the way that you introduced the whole issue of this operation. This is not an operation against Syrian Kurds. The YPG is equal to the PKK which is a terrorist organization as recognized by the United States and the European Union. And in fact, your former defense secretary, Ash Carter, admitted that the YPG and the PKK were one of the same.</p><p>And this organization has been launching attacks against Turkey and NATO allies. Thousands of our citizens have died because of attacks from this terrorist organization. They have used the vacuum in Syria to attack us and we have had to take matters into our own hands. There are, in fact, 300,000 Syrian Kurds right now in Turkey, refugees who have fled from ISIS and from the YPG. We're taking care of them.</p><p>[13:05:00] I'd like to ask you, which European country would take in 300,000 Kurdish refugees from Syria, but we have. Our war is not with the Kurds and this is not an invasion. It's an operation under Article 51 of the United Nations which regards our legitimate right to self-defense.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. Well, you've -- now you've given me the entire rationale for the Turkish Government's operation there but you didn't answer my question. First of all, as you know better than I do, the United States does not consider the YPG terrorists, they do consider the PKK but they have partnered with them in the fight against ISIS. So there is a distinction that they make between those two different Kurdish forces.</p><p>Are you prepared -- no, hold on a second. Ms. Aybet, I need to ask you questions here. Are you prepared -- can you tell us, please, what your intentions are, then? How far are you going to move into Northern Syria? How long? How deep? What are you going to do?</p><p>AYBET: Well, we have discussed this very openly and President Erdogan has actually even shown a map with regards to the proposed establishment of the safe zone which is exactly why we're undertaking this operation. It is something that he discussed with President Trump and both presidents agreed. It's going to be about 20 miles in-depth and just over 400 kilometers long. So there's really no secret about the depth and the actual size of the operation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So, do you have the capacity, most people don't believe you have the willingness or the capacity to actually -- hold on a second, you're nodding your head. I haven't even finished my question -- to take on the 11,000 ISIS fighters who remain in that area, and to police the 70,000 people in the al-Hawl Refugee Camp including women, children, ISIS brides, if you like, and what is being called a nucleus of an ISIS resurgent force. Is Turkey prepared to take on that?</p><p>AYBET: Look, I think, first of all, we have to be clear about one thing. We're not sure exactly about the numbers of ISIS families and fighters that are being kept there apart from information that is predominantly put out by the terrorist organization.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No, no. This is the United States. Ms. Aybet, these are international figures. Sorry. I just want to know, let's not get quibbling about the figures. The YPG which has been fighting and dying against -- in the fight against ISIS now says it's not going to do it because it has to defend itself. Then we know from the inspector general and others that there are thousands of ISIS fighters still in the Northern Syria area. And we know because we visited it. CNN and other reporters have visited that the al-Hawl Refugee Camp contains some 70,000 people, and it's being described, in part, as a possible nucleus of resurgence of ISIS.</p><p>I want to know what Turkey is going to do about those fighters and those people in that camp.</p><p>AYBET: First of all, let me start with our capacity with the second- largest army in NATO. And we've already undertaken two successful military operations to safeguard our borders from terrorism. ISIS and the PKK in Afrin and also Euphrates shield. And we've provided security and stabilized those areas. And in fact, we're the only member of the international coalition against ISIS that have cleared more than 2,000 square kilometers of an area single-handedly by ourselves from ISIS. So we are already very well-rounded in dealing with ISIS.</p><p>We're also dealing with ISIS very well in our own country. We have actually expelled over 5,000 and detained others. So we're right next door to all of this. So you can imagine, we have the capacity to deal with this.</p><p>Now, in terms of the ISIS fighters and there's predominantly the families there that are in these camps and some fighters are actually held in prisons which are closer to our border, of course, initially as we move in our priority is to provide security and stability in the areas that we move into and we are going to. We do have the capacity and we will safeguard any areas that contain these prisons.</p><p>However, we would like the management of the camps, in particular, something that has to be undertaken as a joint effort with the international community. We never said that we would shoulder this burden all by ourselves. We would like the international community to do more because it is a matter of a common security concern for everybody.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to ask you because you alluded to it at the beginning that this operation has been undertaken with the agreement between both presidents, the United States and Turkey.</p><p>[13:10:04] President Trump, as you can see, is facing a great deal of criticism by even members of his own party for what they believe is selling out American allies in this important fight against ISIS. And he is now sort of backpedaling and saying things in public to warn Turkey against going, you know, all out. I mean, he's saying if I judged that they have breached limits, I will destroy the economy. I've already done it in areas before.</p><p>What do you think of the limits? And what do you make of the president's sort of -- I mean, what do you understand as to whether the United States and the White House accepts backs your action and where the limits might be?</p><p>AYBET: Now, President Trump and President Erdogan have reached an understanding over precisely what in operation is. And President Trump and President Erdogan will meet in Washington on the 13th of November to actually discuss further details. And I believe, you know, one of the details that will be discussed is particularly what we were just talking about. The ISIS fighters and the responsibility of the international community. Something that we share as a common vision with the United States.</p><p>We both think that those foreign fighters that, you know, are from Europe should actually be returned to the countries that they came from. So this is something that we're on the same page with, with the Americans. And we have had talks, you know, before this operation a couple of months ago with U.S. officials with regards to, you know, the management of the ISIS captives. So, this is another issue that they will be talking about so there's a clear understanding.</p><p>Now President Trump, obviously -- I mean, I don't know what he meant by some of those tweets, but I would guess that, you know, he's also concerned about the limits. But he knows what the scope of this operation is. So I don't think that given all the understatements that he's made recently in support of Turkey and this operation and his very, very strong stance. I mean, you've seen from the very recent tweets that he is absolutely determined to bring U.S. troops home. And I think this has become a major policy focus for him especially in the domestic front which you mentioned - -</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>AYBET: -- where he's giving this (INAUDIBLE). Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Gulnur, one of his latest tweets he said, \"Any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially and with weapons.\"</p><p>There seems to be a bit of confusion there. And one thing I want to ask you, though, is that the Pentagon, the White House announced that they were closing the air space to Turkey's flight. That's what they warned yesterday. Trying to get you not to do what you're doing today. At least that's what it seems. Are you -- is the air space closed over that area or are you using it freely?</p><p>AYBET: Well, at the moment, as you can see that we are actually attacking, also, from the air. So that actually speaks for itself I guess.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It does, indeed. Gulnur Aybet, thank you so much for joining us from Ankara.</p><p>And now we want to turn to Washington where the president does face sharp and rare criticism from his Republican colleagues as well as Democrats.</p><p>Retired U.S. General John Allen served in Iraq. He led the allied troops in Afghanistan and he served as the U.S. envoy to the global coalition for the fight against ISIS. And he's joining me now from Washington.</p><p>General Allen, welcome to the program. I mean, you have been right there at the cold phase so to speak. What do you make of what you've just heard from the representative and spokesperson and adviser to the Turkish president?</p><p>RET. GEN. JOHN ALLEN, FORMER ENVOY TO THE GLOBAL COALITION TO DEFEAT ISIS: Well, Christiane, it's great to be with you, again. It's good to see you.</p><p>Look, she is right on a number of things. And we have to start any commentary about this by giving Turkey the credit that it's due. You know, it has taken in literally millions of refugees from this conflict then has cared for them over time. She's right, a large number of Kurdish -- Syrian Kurds have been evacuated into Turkey. And she's also correct that from early on along, and I was involved closely in the negotiations.</p><p>The expectation was that there would not be, a Kurdish rump state was the term used at the time along the southern border of Turkey. And that there would eventually be some effort to create a safe zone into which then the potential for the return of Syrian refugees could occur. So she's all correct in those stipulations.</p><p>What's not being said is that, when we started this process, there were no options in Syria.</p><p>[13:15:03] The entire border of Syria with Turkey was we called it blackened up representing the flag of ISIS. And we had very few options. And it was because, in many respects, that the U.S. worked with the PYD and the armed wing which is the YPG that we were able to crack this conundrum open and ultimately bring about the large scale elimination of the ISIS fighters in that part of Syria.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>ALLEN: But it required American and coalition forces, and it's very important to make that point. Coalition forces working closely together with the Syrian Democratic Forces there which are not just Kurd but other ethnic groups as well, ultimately to defeat the ISIS fighters in that region. Turkey was a part of that but by-and-large it was the coalition.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So the YPG, do you call them terrorists?</p><p>ALLEN: They're not terrorists by definition. You know, there are legal differences between how the PKK and the YPG are viewed. The United States has not designated the YPG or the PYD, and the United States has not designated the organization and frankly, early along, Turkey was willing to tolerate. The U.S. assistance to the Syrian Democratic Forces which, again, was largely Kurdish, was willing to tolerate a level of American support for their activities, their fighting against ISIS.</p><p>And, frankly, we would not be where we are today in the military situation in that part of Syria had it not been for the relationship of the international coalition with the YPG and General Mazloum. We would not be anywhere near where we are today.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. So then let me ask you --</p><p>ALLEN: -- in that area.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. Sorry to interrupt you. But we're just getting some news from the White House where they have issued a statement that they do not back this operation and they, quote, have made it clear to Turkey not to have gone ahead with it and that this would be a bad idea. From your perspective, as a commander, and if you were sitting in Ankara, and you saw all these conflicting tweets and you know about the conversation between the two presidents on Sunday night, are they correct to be confused about what the United States thinks? Or do you believe that the U.S. made it very clear from the beginning that this should not happen?</p><p>ALLEN: This is just chaos, Christiane. We don't do strategy and we shouldn't be doing foreign policy by tweet. And this is what you get when you have single phone calls between world leaders occurring and no -- when they put the phone down, no further coordination within the U.S. Government. Our national security mechanism in this country was largely surprised by that phone call and surprised by the tweet that called for the withdrawal of American forces, and surprised by the president's threats against Turkey to destroy its economy. And, of course, the Turks were, I think, similarly surprised by the president's reaction and now, of course, we have this White House statement which, I think, throws more confusion into the situation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the only people who are actually not confused in their intent are the Turks and they have -- as she, Ms. Aybet told me, for several years intended to clear this area, as you just said, to create a safe haven to put back some of the Turkish -- sorry, Syrian refugees who've come into Turkey. But just one other thing, you heard Ms. Aybet say that they are using the air space with impunity right now. Yesterday, we were told by the U.S. administration that they were warning the Turks that they would close the air space to their aircraft as a way to warn them against, you know, excessive force. It's clearly not happening or the threat didn't amount to much.</p><p>ALLEN: Well, again, when you -- when we say we've closed the air space, clearly the first next thing we have to be prepared to say is how we will enforce the closure of the air space. Whether it's a formal closure or whether it's an agreement. We have to be very clear in what will happen if Turkey violates that air space. And if dealing with the Turkish aircraft as they're attacking conceivably, truly, our allies on the ground, the PYD, if the Turks inter that air space and attack those allies, we should be very clear about what we're going to do in the protection of our allies. Not necessarily retaliation against the Turks but how we're going to protect our allies.</p><p>And, of course, that clarity was not announced and so absent that, the Turks are, my guess is you're telling me some of the things that I'm learning right on the spot. My guess is they're using the air space as necessary to support the prosecution of this operation.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So what do you think is going to --</p><p>ALLEN: They're also using surface fires as well.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what do you think is going to look like --</p><p>[13:20:00] ALLEN: Well, I'll tell you, Christiane -- yes, once you push into an area like this, once you start using indirect fire, once you start drawing a lot of blood from an organization that has just been fighting now for a couple of years against the most abhorrent terrorist organization on the planet, the Islamic state, these people were buckling down to begin the process of the stabilization of that entire region. That's why those thousand American troops, if we were going to draw a circle around a group of American troops that are more important right now to the stabilization of any place on the planet, it's that thousand troops. And they were deeply engaged in helping the Syrian Democratic Forces in that area, the Kurds, the other ethnic groups to stabilize the population so that they can get on with the kinds of post-conflict environment that we would want them to do.</p><p>And so having just defeated the Islamic state by-and-large in that area, the conventional elements of it, now we have a more conventional operation in the form of the Turkish attack that the Kurds are going to have to resist. They don't know, frankly, what the objectives of the Turkish forces are going to be. And as you heard, they think that this is an existential issue. And given some of the rhetoric that we have heard that has surrounded this operation, rhetoric that would seem to indicate that the PYD and the YPG and the elements of the Kurdish population could, in fact, be treated in a matter similar to the PKK.</p><p>You know, we get that the fact that the Turks view the PKK as a terrorist organization. We do, as well and we have helped the Turks to fight them. But we have a different view about the PYD and the YPG and the other relevants in Northern Syria. So when you start drawing blood, Christiane, from an organization like this, people better get ready for a fight. And I think that the Turks better be ready for something much bigger than they had anticipated.</p><p>I laud the fact that they want to create a safe zone. I laud the fact that they want to return refugees. But we're going to see thousands of refugees as a result of this fighting. We're going to see a lot of civilian casualties, and we're going to see a significant amount of fighting in that area where prior to that with the work that had been done by the international coalition in partnership with the SDF which has detained as many as 12,000 ISIS fighters and then the al-Hawl camp, there could be as many as 70,000 to 75,000 ISIS dependents if you will. That was the beginning of the stabilization of that region. I think all bets are off now on where that's going to end up.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, you know, it's alarming to hear what you're saying, it's sobering, and we're hearing it from you. The world expert on the global fight against ISIS. General John Allen, thank you for joining us from Washington. Thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>And, you know, we're going to turn now to comedy and satire but it is about the kind of U.S. national security state. There is a sort of a link to all of this. It's the kind of satire you might not take your mind off the woes of the world. Films like \"Four Lions --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today's historic trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong marks a new season of the future of world trade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Chris Morris has taken on jihadists, TV news, and the American presidency.

It's a little bit of fiction, a little bit of fact but, I mean, it's a satire of something that actually really happened. Tell me what inspired you and why you keep probing essentially Islamic terrorism.</p><p>MORRIS: Well, this isn't about Islamic terrorism, this is about a government, a paranoid government reacting to what it thinks might be Islamic terrorism. So the story that struck me is a news story about 10 years ago on British TV news, there was a report that the FBI had arrested an army planning a full-scale ground war against the United States. And I thought that's a striking thing, a full-scale ground war.</p><p>I, by chance, bumped into someone three years later who was involved in that trial. He said, remember that full-scale ground war, you know what it was? It was seven construction workers planning to ride into Chicago on horses.</p><p>And I said come on. What are you talking about? He said, yes, basically these builders, these bankrupt builders bumped into an FBI informant who offered them $50,000 to come up with a plan against the government.</p><p>[13:25:06] Plan number one, they asked for overalls, working boots, and all the things they need to do their jobs, plus and resources to lead a parade against the governor's house in order to protest conditions in the projects. The informant said, you know, you're not going get the money for that, you got to think bigger, and basically provoked them into coming up with a crockpot scheme to knock over the Sears Tower.</p><p>AMANPOUR: To knock over the Sears Tower?</p><p>MORRIS: Yes. Yes. Because he said we need something that's explosive, we need something that's big against the government. Don't just talk about protests. So they rifted this idea. They were not going to do it, I mean --</p><p>AMANPOUR: These are Americans -- where does this army base?</p><p>MORRIS: So they were in Miami, in Liberty City in Miami. And it's very neglected and it's basically the sort of -- it is the paradigm kind of fishing ground for these FBI operations. Now, you know, it could be any poor part of any city.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But why were the FBI trying to provoke, entrap, create an army? Why?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, because they've -- within the confines of the bureaucratic system driven themselves slightly mad, and they've done it by a long step process. They reacted badly to 9/11 because they had certain shortcomings that they have to cover up so they talked up the threat immediately given the impression that there was a sleeper cell in every city. This is a long time ago but remember, this in the context of an us and them dynamic that was coming out of the government, the FBI sort of accidentally discovered that it's harder to catch a real terrorist than it is to make up your own. And this is demonstrated no more clearly than in Boston where they spent a year winding up a schizophrenic to come up with a crazy plan to fly model airplanes into the dome of the Capitol while missing the two guys who were planning to blow up the marathon.</p><p>Because if you find somebody in a marginalized community who is making themselves conspicuous one way or another and surround them with full trends and the promise of money, then you can get them to do something.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So let's get this straight. The crackpot group that you're talking about in Miami, they were real or this is based on a composite of - -</p><p>MORRIS: In my story?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>MORRIS: All right. In my story, we start -- so basically, I did a lot of research and I just looked at all the cases that they've been where there was conspicuous distortion and why the FBI played it. And then, myself and Jesse Armstrong, with him I wrote the script, plotted a story through those kinds of markers of reality but made up a fictional story which reflected, we hoped, everything that we'd come across.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Because you say inspired by a hundred true stories.</p><p>MORRIS: Yes. And it's a figurative hundred, there's more like 300. But what happens is the same. Every time the FBI comes up with a terrorist plot, find someone to try and carry it out and then arrest them for doing that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now people listening to this are going to say, really or is that fiction as well?</p><p>MORRIS: No, it's all in the public record. If people could be bothered to look, it's on the public record. You don't have to look very far. I mean, you can Google the stuff.</p><p>And what happens is that it's a very efficient machine because it's done under the supervision of the DOJ, there's a 99 percent conviction rate. In other words, they do not allow the FBI to arrest until they are sure that the case will fly in court. And you might say this sounds like entrapment. I mean, there was a case in Upstate New York in a very good documentary on HBO called \"The Newburgh Sting\" about four guys who had to be offered $250,000 before they agreed to do anything.</p><p>And even then they said, well, yes, we'll put a bomb in the trunk of the car but can we let it off at night so that no one gets hurt. Those guys are all in jail for 25 years for terrorism. And in that case, the judge said none of this would have happened had it not been for the government. These guys would not have been capable of doing any of this without the help of the government.</p><p>That is on the public records. So this happens a lot. I mean, there's one of these arrests about once every month, once every three weeks. And people just can't be bothered to educate themselves to see what's happening around them. That's the truth.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really extraordinary. And I'm going to play a clip which is from this film but it's a bit about a nuclear plot. So let's just play it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: We know this emergency is groundless.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA GLACK: Correct.</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: But the emergency exits.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA GLACK: Right.</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: And you can't take control so you're not even saying it doesn't exist.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA MUDD: OK.</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: So we have to acknowledge that the emergency exists.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA GLACK: Yes. Well, no. Sorry. If we say yes, it exists, isn't that the same as declaring a nuclear emergency ourselves?</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: Technically yourself but yes.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA GLACK: So to stop a nuclear emergency I have to declare a nuclear emergency?</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: Yes. The logical (INAUDIBLE) if you say it slowly, keep the contradictory elements apart.</p><p>ANNA KENDRICK AS KENDRA GLACK: Well, I will look insane.</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: Only to say it fast and also you already looked insane when you met me at the parking lot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you're just going to throw her under the bus?</p><p>DENIS O'HARE AS ANDY MUDD: No. I would never do that to an agent. She has to do it herself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, yes. I mean, it's really very, very funny. But how did you get from toppling the Sears Tower as a terrorist plot to a nuclear emergency?</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>MORRIS: Right. Well, if you look at the way the FBI works, so as I said, they come up with a plot, they cast some people to try and carry it out. In fact, they write the beats of the story pretty much like a script.</p><p>If you empower some people to come up with an idea against the government and they suddenly take their own initiative, then you're in trouble if you have given them any kind of tools to carry out the job. So you only have to think in bigger terms to imagine this scenario.</p><p>And I ran these past practicing agents and a bit where Anna Kendrick's character comes up with the idea of giving fake news to these guys. The agents I spoke to went uh, because they can see that that's what you would do if you were trying to keep the case alive, even though it's dicey.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is this film and this logic that you've created based on different stories and different incident, is it a follow to \"Four Lions\" which was your first big film? And that was here set in the U.K. about three actual -- group of actual terrorists who actually wanted to be suicide bombers and they were so inept and the police were so inept that they never found them. Is this a follow up?</p><p>MORRIS: The two could have come the other way around because \"Four Lions\" is about some real terrorists and it's about the reality that you find within a sort of cell, the sort of cell that we would see in making those attacks 10 years or so ago. And it's about the fact that human frailty does not take a need sidestep around some guys who are plotting a bombing, right. So it's about terrorists.</p><p>This is really the opposite end. This is about not terrorists. This is about people who because of the racist and paranoid agenda of the government can be identified as terrorists initially and treated as a threat.</p><p>I mean, imagine this, right, you're an agent. You see somebody with some belief system that you don't really understand and you think they might look threatening. Plus, they're black or brown.</p><p>You ask yourself and your colleagues, is that person dangerous? And crucially, what happens if I decide they're not dangerous and they turn out to be, right? So that is the prospective you use.</p><p>Therefore, you better sort them out. Don't leave them alone. So if you surround them with false friends and you can get them to behave irresponsibly, then you have rather proved the case that was the grounds of your suspicions in the first place, even if you have no other grounds apart from the fact that they were different. So this is about people who are not terrorists being made to look like terrorists --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>MORRIS: -- by the government, in the name of protecting the (inaudible).</p><p>AMANPOUR: So now I'm going play a clip from \"Four Lions\" which you did I think in 2010. And it's the one about terrorists who were in court. And here's the scene where a group of those would be terrorists are trying to apparently buy bomb making materials in a supermarket.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FESSAL: Can I have 12 bottles of bleach please.</p><p>BARRY: What's that?</p><p>FESSAL: It's a woman's voice. Cos I got loads of liquid peroxide. Probably thought she'd go in there and --</p><p>BARRY: And what?</p><p>FESSAL: Dye her hair or something.</p><p>BARRY: And her beard?</p><p>FESSAL: What?</p><p>BARRY: You've got a beard.</p><p>FESSAL: I covered it.</p><p>BARRY: You covered your beard yeah. How? Right. So you went into a shop with your hands on your face like that and asked for 12 bottles of bleach? So why has she got her hands on her face, Fess?</p><p>FESSAL: Cos she's got a beard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean you're Chris Morris. I don't want to say -- I mean it's Monty Pythonesque but I mean it's crazy.</p><p>MORRIS: Those guys do have a bad intention. They are planning to blow something up. They bought their own bleach.</p><p>It's just that they can't manage their plan very well. They're like sort of a stag party gone wrong.</p><p>Whereas in this film, they have not got any weapons. In fact, they have -- they banned guns from their mission. And they really have to take a deep breath in order to accept the guns that are being offered and by the person who is always -- who's also offering the money.</p><p>AMANPOUR: There are very few comedian satirists who actually mock Islamic terrorism and mock this kind of, you know, national security issue, that's been abroad certainly since 9/11. But why did you decide to take that head on?</p><p>MORRIS: Well, because I think that 9/11 just set a whole lot of balls in motion that is still rolling now. When George Bush said either you're for us or against us, he provided the first modern wedge-like split within society and within the west. It suddenly demonized a whole bunch of people anew.</p><p>I mean, this demonization of people who are not like you has been going on for a long time. But he rebirthed it and gave it a really sort of spanking new form.</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>And that meant that anyone who had a position that was against the government would fall under suspicion.</p><p>Once I had been struck by the fact, the obvious fact, that guys riding into Chicago on horses is not the next 9/11, but it was being presented as if it was by the attorney general on television, it seemed pretty obvious that I was going to do a film about it.</p><p>Just listen to this. This is how the FBI changed their logic after 9/11. Instead of saying we have evidence to show you are a terrorist, they say we don't have evidence to show you're not a terrorist. Well, off you go.</p><p>I mean, that is carte blanche, isn't it? That's not a very clever way to proceed if you're actually trying to stop something. It's a kind of institutionalized panic reaction.</p><p>And I'm not very keen on things which desert rationality and intelligence. I think the only hope we've got of clinging on to this planet together is actually if we use everything that we've got to our best ability. Not behave historically in one way or another.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's really an important point. And you've also tackled things like \"Veep.\" These were pre-Trump episodes that you were involved in.</p><p>And it just seems that the world with this relentless news cycle and some of it really absurd, some of it could be real life satire is almost outpacing satire right now.</p><p>MORRIS: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: No, you don't buy that?</p><p>MORRIS: I mean that's what Tom Lehrer said when Kissinger got the Nobel Peace Prize. When was that, 1970?</p><p>I mean anyone who says that is basically handing in their cards. They have just given up. They have essentially told the world that their imagination has ceased to function properly.</p><p>I mean, it's not about that. If you look at Trump -- and right now, it's a field day. The only problem is finding the level ground to play it all, right.</p><p>Because everybody from each side is behaving ridiculously. Including, of course, the president. But not just.</p><p>So as a satirist, you're going to start playing with anybody who goes off the deep end, anybody who demonstrates hysteria where they should be thinking straight.</p><p>And the challenge of Trump and other problems of the time is keep your head. Don't call them out on the things that really they haven't done. Just keep marking what they do.</p><p>You know, this -- the policy in turkey and with the Kurds, just mark that. Possibly the worst decision Donald Trump has made. Who knows.</p><p>So it's not a case of, oh, it's, you know, reality has now got ahead of us. No. I mean -- and if you feel that for a second, well, very well catch up.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And on that note, nice to catch up with you.</p><p>MORRIS: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Chris Morris, thank you very much indeed.</p><p>MORRIS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And always topical.</p><p>Now, for our next guest, who you might recognize from the hit T.V. show \"Shark Tank\" or as the owner of the NBADallas Mavericks. Mark Cuban's business ventures have made him one of the world's most recognized entrepreneurs, but it's his passion for politics, which we've had some speculating about a potential presidential bid.</p><p>He sat down with our Walter Isaacson just recently to talk about it.</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CONTRIBUTOR: So when you were a kid, they don't know you're going to be the world's greatest businessman. Until your parents say hey, you have got to learn to lay carpet?</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER, NBA DALLAS MAVERICKS: Yes. It was crazy because my mom was concerned about me and she wanted me to learn to trade. My dad had done upholstery on cars.</p><p>And we were middle class, never struggled, right. But she said, you know, you've got to be able to take care of a family at some point. So she worked in a real estate office.</p><p>And guy's name was Bobby Freedman. He said, \"We're going teach you how to lay carpet.\" So Bobby had an office on Washington Road in Pittsburgh. And I remember him just basically going in there saying, \"Here is the carpet, here is the stuff. Right. And I'm going tell you what to do and let's see how you do.\"</p><p>People are still tripping and falling in that office. It didn't work out very well but --</p><p>ISAACSON: But one of the themes in your life is the things you fail out really starts helping you. So I'm glad you failed at laying carpet.</p><p>CUBAN: I am too. Right. I'm glad I failed rolling the bar. I'm glad I failed laying carpet.</p><p>ISAACSON: Tell me about some of your early business ventures like that when you were a kid and then a little bit older.</p><p>CUBAN: Oh my God, I remember my dad and his buddies used to play poker. And they would come to our house every few weeks and going to my dad and saying I want new pair of basketball shoes because I was a huge basketball junky then and now.</p><p>And he was like see those tennis shoes you have? When you have your own job, you can buy whatever shoes you want.</p><p>ISAACSON: That's an incentive to get a job.</p><p>CUBAN: Right? Well, so one of the guys who was at the poker table was like I can get a job for you. And I'm 12-years-old at the time.</p><p>And I'm like what? And he goes I've got these boxes of garbage bags.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>Why don't you go to the neighbors and sell these garbage bags? I'm like OK. You know, what should I sell them for?</p><p>He goes \"I'm going to sell them to you for three bucks.\" There's a hundred garbage bags and I never forget there were really little garbage bags but there was a hundred. And I bought them for $3 and sold them for $6.</p><p>But here is how it went. Hi. My name is Mark. I live up the street. Walter, do you use garbage bags? Would you like to buy a hundred of them so you don't have to worry about going to pick them up and I'll bring them to your house every couple of weeks when you need them?</p><p>And I was probably the world's first garbage bags salesperson with a garbage bag route. And then from there, it just blossomed. I mean I was just always doing something, selling something.</p><p>Because once I learned how to sell, everything was easy.</p><p>ISAACSON: When was the first time you got fired?</p><p>CUBAN: When I was working for Your Business Software. And I had gotten -- I moved to Dallas with a bunch of my buddies. I was living with six guys in a three-bedroom apartment sleeping on the floor. Just, it was nasty. We used to call it the Hill Hotel.</p><p>And I got a job working at night as a bartender and I got a job working at a software store. This is the early days of the PC industry. This is 1982, end of '82, early '83.</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes. Before the Macintosh.</p><p>CUBAN: Before the Macintosh, right. And this is when, when I worked there I had to go get certified in order to be able to sell lotus 1-2-3. That's Spreadsheet for $495.</p><p>But I recognized that I had an aptitude for tech and I loved it. And so I learned and learned and learned and start teaching myself to write Lotus 1- 2-3 macros and ToS scripts and debase programming.</p><p>And finally, I got to the point where I had this big sale. It was going to be a $15,000 sale with a $1500 commission which meant I can move out of the Hill Hotel and get out of there. I mean literally, it was awful.</p><p>And so some of my responsibilities were to come into the store, Your Business Software, and be there at 9:00 a.m., wipe down the windows, sweep the floor, open up a retail store effectively. And I called my boss, Michael, and I said, look, I've got it all set up. Someone's going to cover for me. And I want to go close this deal, I'll bring in the check. He goes no.</p><p>I'm like what? I mean -- so I made the executive decision. I was going to pick up the check thinking the store needed the business, right. Here is $15,000. When I came back, fired me.</p><p>ISAACSON: So what -- that leads to some successes along the way.</p><p>CUBAN: Yes, big time. And so there I was with no job. So first thing I do was get my friend's car and we all went down to Galveston from Dallas just to clear our heads.</p><p>And I remember taking a pad, a yellow pad, and writing on it, OK, I'm going start my own consulting company if you will. Because PCs were new to everybody. And I just spent nine months every single day teaching myself to go working all night, learning this new stuff.</p><p>And so I'm like OK, I've got to think of something that's very succinct. So I came up with MicroSolutions.</p><p>And I was going to go to businesses and anybody who, you know, because back then people didn't realize they needed PCs. What do I need a PC for? I've got my secretary who has a typewriter and I've got a copy machine. This new PC thing, I don't need it. And so I thought, OK, I'm going to take a chance.</p><p>So I went to this company that had come into the store and didn't buy anything, called Architectural Lighting. And they needed a time and billing program that was $500 retail and $250 cost. And I had no money.</p><p>I mean literally back then we would go to the grocery store at midnight because that's when they lowered the price of the chicken packs. And so, you know, I was broke.</p><p>And so I went to them and I said, look, if you'll front me the $500, if it doesn't work for whatever reason, I'll walk your dog, I'll wash your car. Fortunately, it worked. And then from there I just added another referral, another referral, you know, kept on learning how to program.</p><p>And for the next seven plus years, I coded and we built that company MicroSolutions to $36 million run rate sales and sold it to CompuServe.</p><p>ISAACSON: So how did you take the parlay, your winnings, from your first business? What did you start up next?</p><p>CUBAN: When I first got that money, I went to my friend, Charlie, and he was at Goldman Sachs and Roly Rolls was his partner. I want to invest like a 60-year-old man. I want it in -- I want this to last me forever. If I have to live like a student forever. And then like, that's not (inaudible) just do this for me, right.</p><p>And then all the sudden they start to ask me questions about technology. They were like, what do you think about this company? What do you think about this software? What do you think is going it happen there?</p><p>And they were trading on it and making a lot of money. Like OK, I'll start trading. So I started making 80, 90, 100 percent a year on my money. Because back then, that's -- you know, they had one analyst, you know, Goldman who covered tech and, you know, one here and one there.</p><p>And it was like taking candy from a baby. And so they wanted me to start a hedge fund, which I did for about three months. Then someone came in and bought it.</p><p>And so right off the bat I'm like OK, I made a couple more million dollars. I made all this money from trading.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>But then come forward, fast forward to 1990 -- early '95, late 1994, I was back in Dallas and I was hanging out with one of my friends from college. And he was like you know what do you think about this idea of using the Internet, which is brand new, to listen to Indiana University basketball?</p><p>I'm like OK, I'm a networking guy. I'm learning about the Internet. Let me see if I can figure it out.</p><p>And so I bought a Packard Bell computer in the second bedroom of my house and I bought an ISDN line, which is a big deal back then, and a modem. Again, an ISDN modem. I'm like OK, let me see what I can do.</p><p>I then went to the local radio station, KLIF in Dallas, an a.m. station and I said, look, this might be the new cable. This might be nothing. But I want to come down and record your radio shows and try to put them on this thing called the Internet. And let's see what happens.</p><p>ISAACSON: So it's streaming audio and it becomes broadcast.com.</p><p>CUBAN: Well, yes. Back then, it was called Internet broadcasting.</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes.</p><p>CUBAN: Then from there, it was like ready, set, go. So I took -- I put up the initial money and we just started calling on every radio station we could find and just built that and then we turned it into broadcast.com once video became available.</p><p>And then in 1998, we took it public. It was the biggest IPO in the history of the stock market at the time and then sold it to Yahoo! and the rest unfortunately is the wrong history.</p><p>ISAACSON: In order to be that innovative and to start all these tech businesses like that, it helped that you had space.</p><p>CUBAN: Yes.</p><p>ISAACSON: Nowadays, the big tech companies pretty much dominate. It seems harder to find the space to innovate. And yet you're not in favor of breaking up or regulating the big tech company. Why?</p><p>CUBAN: First, I don't think it's more difficult. I think that the wedges are maybe harder to find, but the going to why not break up the tech cycle, talk about Facebook, right.</p><p>You don't need to use Facebook. This isn't 1984 with AT&amp;T where, you know, if you want to make a phone call, you have one way to do it and you had to go to AT&amp;T.</p><p>You want to share pictures with grandma? There's a hundred ways to share pictures with grandma.</p><p>You want to get a news feed? There's a thousand ways to get a news feed. There's not one feature on Facebook that isn't replicated by 30 different products.</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes. But when a snap comes along and it competes with Facebook, Facebook can mush them down.</p><p>CUBAN: Yes, they can mush them down. When you run with the elephants, there's the quick in the dead, right.</p><p>And we used to have to compete with IBM and then you've always said that you're competing with Microsoft. No matter what.</p><p>Now, didn't break -- people discussed breaking up Microsoft and there was certainly anti-trust with I -- Internet Explorer. I just --</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes, but there was anti-trust against Microsoft.</p><p>CUBAN: Sure.</p><p>ISAACSON: There's anti-trust against IBM.</p><p>CUBAN: Sure.</p><p>ISAACSON: And this opens the way for things for be it Netscape or Apple to come along. Don't you think we need a little bit more anti-trust enforcement?</p><p>CUBAN: Well, there's two different things. One, in terms of acquisitions.</p><p>OK, there's a good argument to be made that there should be -- there are certain spaces maybe that we shouldn't allow acquisitions.</p><p>ISAACSON: You know there's Facebook taking Instagram.</p><p>CUBAN: Right, of course. But no one thought Instagram was a huge deal when they bought Instagram. It was still growing. Remember Instagram started in 2011.</p><p>Remember, as Snapchat had a chance to sell to them and they didn't. I remember sitting, talking with Evan Spiegel and saying, look, dude --</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes. But wouldn't it have been bad if Facebook just gets to buy up everything?</p><p>CUBAN: Again, what are they actually buying? It's one thing if it were something that is a utility that you have to use. It's another thing if it's all optional.</p><p>I mean, look at what happened -- look at what is happening to Facebook in the United States. Their audience is declining. My 13 and my 16-year-old kids have no interest in Facebook whatsoever.</p><p>My 81-year-old mom does, right. My wife uses it to keep up with her parents and some of her friends. But there's no real utility to it.</p><p>And even now when you look at our companies that are buying advertising, it's more effective now on Google than it is on Facebook. Unless you're selling to an older audience.</p><p>ISAACSON: OK. But put on your shark tank hat. Every Sunday night, right. People come and they pitch a business to you. Don't you think pretty early on in the pitch how could Facebook or how could Google crush this thing before you invest?</p><p>CUBAN: Always. Always. But it's always been that way but it doesn't mean there can't be great ideas.</p><p>You know, yes, IBM have survived in some manner. Microsoft took cloud computing really to reinvigorate them but Facebook, I don't see that there's an eternal right for Facebook to exist or for Google.</p><p>ISAACSON: Do you think businesses should have a double bottom line, that they should be --</p><p>CUBAN: Yes, without question. So -- and you look at it -- I don't look it as a double bottom line. I look at it as the big picture, right.</p><p>I think you've got to be socially aware. Because the one thing that destroys a business is social unrest. If you're in a community that can't be rebuilt, you know, or is having social problems or there's violence, you're not doing business, right.</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>If you're in an industry that is contributing to -- pick a topic whether it's climate change, whether it's discord, right, people are paying attention now. The flip side of the Internet and social media is just so easy to send a message on what you care about.</p><p>Now from a business perspective, if you're able to contribute in more than just your own personal bottom line, people recognize that change is happening in this world and maybe there's a better reason to do business with you.</p><p>You know, even if you're -- what you're selling costs a nickel more, you're contributing more than a nickel's worth of value to the world that my kids have to live in or that I, as an 18-year-old, will have to live in in 20 years. So I think it's not just good for the bottom line but it's good for sales.</p><p>ISAACSON: How would you apply your entrepreneurial skills and business skills to some of the nation's problems like health care?</p><p>CUBAN: Right. I'm glad you asked. So health care has gone from Obamacare really trying to change the game to now the discussion of Medicare for All/Single payer.</p><p>Obamacare made a structural mistake when they built the whole program on insurance. The problem when you build a program with insurance, the incentives of the insurance companies are not aligned with health care or wellness.</p><p>Now, you look to single payer and they're saying, well, insurance companies are part of the problem. So OK, let's remove them but they don't deal with equity issues at all.</p><p>You know, there's no reason for somebody who's making $50,000 -- a family who's making $50,000 a year to pay more taxes to pay for my family's health care. You know it's just wrong.</p><p>And so I think rather than addressing how to pay for it as a model, which is what's happened up to this point, we have to look at what makes people healthier. Politically, you can make things work like you can have a hybrid where somebody who is making up to 400 percent of the poverty level, they have single payer, right.</p><p>Maybe there's a small copay. Maybe there's not. But effectively, their health care -- insurance to their health care is free. Somebody who is making over -- maybe their health care is based off a percentage of their income that is means tested.</p><p>So if you make $80,000 a year as a family, you might pay two percent. If you make a $100,000, you might pay six percent.</p><p>But that has equity to it. So that we're not all trying to have one size fits all because it won't work. So you have to look at this not as a model, how are we going to pay for things, we just raise taxes, which I'm not opposed to, but let's just pay for everybody's health care.</p><p>But we have to start asking the question, how are we going to make people healthier? Because If we make them healthier, then our cost for health care go down.</p><p>ISAACSON: What do you think about wealth tax?</p><p>CUBAN: It depends on the details, right. Look, fundamentally, I'm not opposed to paying more taxes at all.</p><p>A wealth tax, or national property tax if you want, it really depends on what type of assets you attach it to. are they liquid? Will they cause some other harm? It really depends on the details.</p><p>It sounds really good right now but I think the bigger fundamental problem from some of the further left candidates is we know we're going to raise taxes, right. And that's fine.</p><p>And we know they're going to raise taxes the maximum amount they can. And that's fine too.</p><p>But we don't work backwards from the amount of money we're going to raise and prioritize what needs to happen next. When you listen to candidates right now, you don't see prioritized lists. It's not like they're saying well, this is number one, this is number two.</p><p>And then when we get down the bottom here, because that's not how politics works. But someone needs to come in and say what are your priorities? And that's just not happening.</p><p>ISAACSON: What would you do about gun control?</p><p>CUBAN: That's a great question. And I know I'm going to get a lot of hell. I think you can own anything you want. I don't care what it is if it's a bazooka, as long as it's in your house and on your property.</p><p>And the minute you take it off your property, go right to jail. Unless you alerted the appropriate authorities and we put a GPS on that device. So if you want to go to the gun club, hey, guys, I'm going, I called the local police and they're following me, right.</p><p>If you have to carry the resents and you get a carry license, hey guys, I've got my GPS on my gun, I'm taking the bank receipts -- I'm taking the receipts to the bank. If you can track me on your Google Maps, you know exactly where I am.</p><p>But, to me, you have the right. I mean it's just who we are as --</p><p>ISAACSON: But wait, don't you worry about the privacy rights of the government using a GPS to track your weapons?</p><p>CUBAN: Not for specialty issues because we -- insurance -- we're tracked all the time no matter what. In New York City, if you break the law, there's going to be a camera that caught you somewhere, right. And with computer vision, they're going to know it's you.</p><p>So do I freak out about that? No. I'm a Scout McNealy fan who says you have no privacy, just get used to it. And so from a gun control perspective, protect your property.</p><p>If that's what you think is the best way to protect your family, go for it. This is the United States of America. I'm not a gun advocate in a big way.</p><p>[13:55:00]</p><p>I'm not a gun fan, right. But at the same time we are who we are.</p><p>ISAACSON: So why aren't you running for president?</p><p>CUBAN: Because my family voted it down.</p><p>ISAACSON: Come on. Come on. Come on.</p><p>CUBAN: Seriously.</p><p>ISAACSON: All right. But, I mean, don't you think you should be getting into public life if you have these passions?</p><p>CUBAN: There's different ways to do it. There's different ways to impact health care.</p><p>So literally, a lot of things that we discuss on the periphery, I put into a package called the temp plan that I literally had had scored by three different economic groups.</p><p>Right now the rand is scoring it on 10-year plan just like the office and budget management would do. I've taken it to the Democrats. I've taken it to the Republicans.</p><p>When all the Medicare for All stuff hit, the Democrats kind of pushed it down but the Republicans are incorporating it to a lot of things that they're potentially talking about. And so I met with a lot more Republicans lately.</p><p>But that's one way. If I can push that forward and the numbers continue to prove it out, because effectively I think everybody deserves the right to be healthy but we have to get you there, right. And it can't just be, like I said, just worrying about how you pay for it. It's how do we get you healthy.</p><p>So that's one. You'll see me do some other things in health care when it comes to drugs that I really can't go into detail yet. But even though I may not be running, you don't have to be the leader to be a leader.</p><p>ISAACSON: Thank you, Mark.</p><p>CUBAN: Thank you, Walter. I really enjoy it, as always.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We'll look for those proposals.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. Thanks for watching and good night from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Journalists, activists, political opponents regularly serve jail time for things they write or say publicly. Well, now the country's Parliament has passed a bill; it would force tech companies to comply with local rules for one of the last relatively free platforms in Turkey - social media. Durrie Bouscaren reports.             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 It all started with a baby. In June, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed his eighth grandchild. But when the Erdogan family's official social media accounts posted about the occasion, some Turks took the opportunity to levy criticism at the president. Erdogan vowed to prosecute those responsible and have these kinds of posts removed and controlled.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN:                 (Speaking non-English language).             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 \"Do you understand why we are against social media like YouTube, Twitter and Netflix?\" He said. \"This kind of media does not suit this nation.\"             </p><p>GULIN CAVUS:                 People see these platforms to - make their voice.             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 Gulin Cavus is the editor in chief of Teyit, a social media fact-checking organization based in Turkey. She says the legislation just passed by Turkey's Parliament may become a de facto type of censorship.             </p><p>GULIN CAVUS:                 Turkey is a really polarized country, and many people don't trust news and mainstream media organizations. So people use social media, especially, like, Twitter or Facebook, to get news.             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 She worries it may cut off one of the last platforms for free speech in Turkey. If people are afraid of being prosecuted, they may not post at all. According to a Freedom House report, at least 500 people have been detained since May, accused of spreading fake or manipulative information about COVID-19. Free speech advocates, however, say many posters were simply criticizing government policies or trying to warn the public.             </p><p>GULIN CAVUS:                 With this bill, probably people just afraid of when they say something against government, they just think that they will punish.             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 The bill itself require social media platforms to have a representative in Turkey and respond to requests for content removal within 48 hours. Companies could be fined, have their advertising banned or their bandwidth reduced, essentially blocking their use if they don't comply. Turkish tech consultant Ussal Sahbaz sees it as a way to give the Turkish government some teeth, to stand up to large American tech companies.             </p><p>USSAL SAHBAZ:                 I don't think it has been pushed by the government to ban a certain thing on the social media. I think government is just trying to gain ground against the big tech companies. It will be able to bargain with them and to be able to regulate with them.             </p><p>DURRIE BOUSCAREN:                 Supporters of the bill in Turkey argue that these roles hold social media companies accountable for the content they host. A lot of countries have passed laws to try and stem disinformation or violent threats or explicit content. The difference is what Turkey may consider offensive in a country that already makes it a crime to insult its leaders.             </p><p>                For NPR News, I'm Durrie Bouscaren in Istanbul.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF AK'S \"23.01.2018\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2020072914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-GGT1-DY2S-N02J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

However, it is not always possible for the internal R&amp;D departments to hit the right spots every single time due to both practicability and economic reasons. As a result, seizing the existing opportunities and acquiring a fresh start-up which brings the required innovation with limited resources appears to be a popular solution. However, this approach has its positive and worrisome characteristics in the eyes of competition authorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Especially since mid-2010s, M&amp;A's in the digital markets started to create a concern as to whether current competition rules and implementation are insufficient to assess these M&amp;A's. The standpoint of competition authorities in former cases drew more attention than ever and competition authorities' past decisions are being called into question.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this piece, we will evaluate the effects of these acquisitions in digital markets along with the reactions of the competition authorities.</p><p>Digital Platforms and Importance of Data</p><p>As the era of digitalisation is in front of our doors in different fields and dimensions, a different approach may be needed to understand the characteristics of digital markets even though competition laws are flexible and innovative to some extent. Such a need seems to ever more present especially on fields that depend on Big Data and AI. Moreover, the fact that \"monetary price\" of digital goods and services are far from reflecting the overall picture in digital markets due to the increasing worth of data is another reason why conventional and accumulated wisdom in competition law may just miss the target when dealing with the relationship between the structures of such markets and the welfare of the recipients of relevant goods and services.</p><p>The term \"data\" refers to personal or commercial information, which are commercially valuable especially if only one or a few competitors are able to access these. Reasonably, latest trend for digital firms is to develop their strength in the processing and collection of \"data\", as it is the key to knowledge and fuels algorithms that creates competitive differences in today's world. As it is not possible to establish a direct link between data and turnover, especially in the initial phases of start-ups where they manage to collect a significant amount of data but did not yet figure out how to monetize, current merger review thresholds can be inadequate. Certain acquisitions do not trigger the notification thresholds although they may relate to the acquisition of significant future challengers by big tech companies in their incipiency.</p><p>From the perspective of the dynamics of digital era, if there is one asset that is more important than cash, it is data. Thus, acquiring small (in terms of turnover) but data-rich services may allow the acquirer to enjoy the best of both worlds by increasing its competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the existing rivals and eliminating the threat of a new challenger with a single blow. The recently cleared acquisition of Apple/Shazam may be given as an example to the foregoing. Thanks to Shazam's huge database, containing not only Apple Music users' data, but also those of other competitors' such as Spotify, Youtube Music, Tidal and Deezer; Apple now has access to key data of its competitors. Yet, this is not all. The merger also allowed Apple to put aside any concerns regarding Shazam's entering into competition with Apple Music in the future. One can see a pattern when company's former actions which consists the acquisitions of Beats Music in 2015, BookLamp in 2014, Dryft in 2014 and Prime Sense in 2013 is looked at as a whole.</p><p>Merger Control in the Digital Markets</p><p>The main problem that prevents competition authorities from even being able to examine some digital acquisitions, especially start-up acquisitions, appears to be turnover thresholds. However, if a too low threshold is to be introduced, a significant amount of irrelevant transactions would have to be evaluated, creating resource problems and inefficiencies. In that vein, adopting alternative approaches to turnover-based thresholds (e.g. transaction value thresholds) or designing sector specific merger review rules for digital markets may be required to solve this problem.</p><p>In addition, constructing counterfactuals may have to come very close to fortune-telling when it is considered that the data and technology belonging to a start-up may be used in a broader scope once internalized by an acquirer, which is active in various markets and is conducting R&amp;D activities regarding numerous other alternatives. Furthermore, the fact that such acquisitions are no longer limited to start-ups, and that giant companies which can be considered as leaders in their markets may also become subjects, increased the significance of this issue even further.</p><p>Since 2016, OECD started to hold roundtables, hearings and conferences regarding the digital economy and competition. Within this scope, OECD organized the \"Competition and Digital Economy\" conference in June 2019. A salient point that OECD expressed was the challenges facing current competition rules vis-\u00e0-vis the digital economy. Importantly, OECD placed this subject (i.e. \"how to treat mergers in digital markets\") among the five issues to be explored in the future<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/competition/digital-economy-innovation-and-competition.htm\">https://www.oecd.org/competition/digital-economy-innovation-and-competition.htm</url></p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>Regulators and competition authorities are digging hard to find a way to strengthen and solidify their assessments in digital mergers. Below we scan three recent development in this regard.</p><p>Facebook/WhatsApp Case</p><p>Undoubtedly, one of the most significant cases which led to discussions among the competition authorities regarding the effectiveness of turnover thresholds was the WhatsApp/Facebook merger. Since WhatsApp's turnover in 2013 did not trigger the turnover thresholds in the EU Merger Regulation (\"EUMR\"), it was considered that the transaction did not have an EU dimension. However, the transaction was reviewed under the national competition laws of Portugal, Spain and UK. Pursuant to Article 4(5) of the EUMR, Facebook requested the Commission to examine the transaction within the scope of the referral system. Even though certain significant digital mergers including Facebook/Instagram and Google/Waze deals avoided Commission's scrutiny due to the turnover thresholds before, implications of a facing the possibility (though this was not realized due to Facebook's willingness to initiate the referral mechanism voluntarily to let the Commission evaluate the transaction) of letting an USD 22 billion transaction which affects almost 2 billion users worldwide slide by without any examination were quite serious.</p><p>As a consequence of Facebook/WhatsApp incident, creating \"safety nets\" that would allow authorities to examine digital mega mergers that do not trigger turnover thresholds became a priority and Bundeskartellamt, along with the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (\"BWB\"), led the way in 2018. In order to fix the so-called \"WhatsApp-gap\", Germany and Austria introduced a new transaction value threshold which aims to cover cases where current turnover and the purchase price for the company differ to a disproportionate extent<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Paragraph 2 of Guidance on Transaction Value Thresholds for Mandatory Pre-merger Notification (Section 35 (1a) GWB and Section 9 (4) KartG), para. 3.</p></bodyText></footnote>. Also, paragraph 2 of the Guidance on Transaction Value Thresholds for Mandatory Pre-merger Notification (Section 35 (1a) GWB and Section 9 (4) KartG) published by Bundeskartellamt and BWB explicitly stressed out that the main goal to introduce this threshold is to close the gap in the system<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>Paragraph 2 of Guidance on Transaction Value Thresholds for Mandatory Pre-merger Notification (Section 35 (1a) GWB and Section 9 (4) KartG), para. 2.</p></bodyText></footnote>:</p><p>\"Section 35 (1a) GWB and Section 9 (4) of the Austrian Cartel Act 2005 (Kartellgesetz, KartG) close a gap in the system of merger control so that it is able to perform its function to the fullest extent in an increasingly dynamic economic environment. This also takes account of the progressive digitalisation and integration of economy and society.\"</p><p>By this amendment, the transaction value threshold became effective in both Austria and Germany<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>For Germany, the value of the transaction should exceed EUR 400 million and for Austria, the value of the transaction should exceed EUR 200 million.</p></bodyText></footnote>. Yet, introducing such a threshold may create another problem from the perspective of administrative costs. Since this threshold is not industry specific, it may catch certain transactions that would not create any competition concerns, creating an additional burden on competition authorities.</p><p>Furman Report</p><p>Another significant development in relation to competition in digital markets was realized in the UK. \"Unlocking digital competition Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel\", commonly known as the \"Furman Report\", was published and revealed innovative recommendations for the competition law assessment in the digital era. With regard to big tech-mergers, the Furman Report underscored that the largest five tech companies have made over 400 acquisitions globally in the last 10 years<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>The Furman Report, page. 12.</p></bodyText></footnote>. The Furman Report also emphasized that during last five years, none of the 250 acquisitions that have been realized in digital markets were notified voluntarily to the CMA, and none were called in for investigation, either at phase 1, or phase 2 levels<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>The Furman Report, page.91.</p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>A very strong language is preferred in the Furman Report regarding the current approach of competition authorities towards mergers in digital markets, calling for a \"reset\". As a strategic recommendation, it further pointed out that \"the CMA should take more frequent and firmer action to challenge mergers that could be detrimental to consumer welfare through reducing future levels of innovation and competition, supported by changes to legislation where necessary\" <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>The Furman Report, page. 93.</p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>With regards to the thresholds applied by the CMA, the Furman Report acknowledges that the share of supply test may provide flexibility to the CMA in order to catch the mergers.</p><p>However, the Furman Report also recognizes that a transaction value threshold may be considered in the future, in case the share of supply test ever becomes insufficient.</p><p>In addition to the Furman Report, in July 2019, the CMA also published a report called \"Digital Markets Strategy Report\". In the report, the CMA classified the potential reform of its merger assessment methodology as first priority, stating that even though merger assessment tools were built for the analogue age, it is important to use existing powers to the fullest extent possible in the digital age as well. This report may constitute a blueprint for the designing of future enforcement action<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>CMA's Digital Markets Strategy Report, page. 9.</p></bodyText></footnote>.</p><p>Commission's Position</p><p>In 2019, the Commission published a report, thoroughly analysing the digital economy and its effects on the competition policy. The report was titled \"Competition Policy for the digital era\" and a complete section was allocated to merger and acquisitions in the digital arena.</p><p>The Commission acknowledges that under current merger control framework, it may have difficulties in catching digital acquisitions due to the relatively low turnover that start-ups may generate. As pointed out above, by their very nature, start-ups mostly focus on creating their product and establishing user base instead of in the short term and views monetisation as a secondary concern. The Commission expressed that it is very well aware of the fact that some digital mergers may get away unnoticed in the current turnover threshold system, whilst also emphasizing that certain cases are brought before the Commission via referral system such as Facebook/WhatsApp and Apple/Shazam.</p><p>While concluding the section assessing the potential new thresholds in its in-depth report, the Commission pointed out that although it is following the developments closely, the EU should not change its current system for now<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>Competition Policy for the digital era, page 115.</p></bodyText></footnote>:</p><p>\"We consider that, against this setting and in light of the difficulties that the introduction of a non-turnover-based threshold into the EUMR would raise, the EU should wait and assess a) how the new transaction value-based thresholds in Austria and Germany play out in practice, and b) whether the referral system would ensure that transactions of EU-wide relevance are ultimately analysed at EU level. Only if major gaps arise should the EUMR be amended. Even then, there will remain a choice between strengthening and improving the referral regime or amending the EUMR's jurisdictional thresholds.\"</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Law needs to catch up with the rapid developments in the world which are certainly accelerated in the new millennium after computer and internet became an inseparable part of our lives. By the establishment of digital platforms, this change increased its pace even further along with its scope and dimensions. New markets have been created which have completely unfamiliar characteristics for the regulators, making life extremely difficult for them. Competition rules were among those that felt the effects of transition to a brand-new reality most strongly and even experienced existential crises on some fronts. Now we are living in a digital era whereby data has immense influence over our lives, and it is steadily becoming the new \"currency\" in many respects. The idiosyncrasies of digital era require the adoption of new approaches and the development of new methodologies for analysing competition in digital markets. As market dynamics are entrenched in the fabric of competition law, the interpretation of the relevant rules evolved along with the markets themselves and competition law was obliged to face and conquer \"unprecedentedness\" a few times in its relatively brief history. Today, there is a new challenge in the form of the digital economy, and concrete steps have been taken in the last 5 years to reconcile old habits with new realities. Yet, it seems that the digital economy will be the hottest topic in the competition authorities' agendas for a while and it will take some time for the competition rules to take their final form.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Housing is \"affordable\" but runs against the headwinds of median household income that is well below the national average.</p><p>They rank last among larger metros in the Milken Institute's new Best Performing Cities report. Anchorage was trailing, too, at No. 197.</p><p>The Seattle-Bellevue-Everett metropolitan division came in at No. 8, but you probably suspected something like that. Just as Washington was among the top performers in Milken's recent State Technology and Science Index, we're used to being among the nation's economic elite.</p><p>(This reality coexists with the discontents I enumerated above, but it is very difficult to find the Goldilocks location, with moderate growth and relatively low inequality; Minneapolis-St. Paul comes closest among major metros).</p><p>I'm less a fan of the Best Performing Cities list than of the state tech and science rankings. The latter is based on a wider set of metrics, while the former is heavily weighted to job and wage growth.</p><p>The Best Performing list sweeps in disparate places. For example, No. 1 Provo-Orem, Utah, had a population of 603,000 in 2016 compared with about 3 million for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett area and 3.8 million for the wider Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan statistical area (MSA).</p><p>The rankings also uses a mixed bag of units: metropolitan divisions for some large metros and broader MSAs for other areas.,The result is comparing Red Delicious to Honeycrisp apples, if not apples to oranges.</p><p>Elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, the Tacoma-Lakewood metro division ranked No. 75, while the Boise MSA was No. 12 and Portland No. 33.</p><p>Still, the Best Performing Cities report is influential for corporate site selectors, academics and others. Its publication gives us a chance to take stock at this knife's-edge moment, when the national economy is growing strong but facing serious stress.</p><p>Rigorous studies are more valuable now with the federal government not updating many data sets because of the shutdown.</p><p>The report's Seattle snapshot contains some things that we know - high wages driven by tech giants and a strong research university - and some assertions that are open to debate, \"Shortage of residential and commercial real estate makes it difficult for new companies to move in and for existing companies to expand.\"</p><p>In fact, residential real-estate prices are cooling and the recent go-go years of apartment construction are producing enough supply to lower rents somewhat. Metro Seattle's cost advantage over the Bay Area continues to attract high-end jobs and tech outposts, on top of homegrown research institutions. Amazon and Microsoft are still expanding here.</p><p>But the deeper story is the continued diversity of the metropolitan economy. Tech is the sexy story. But the region remains a major manufacturing center with Boeing and the aerospace cluster, and also shipbuilding.</p><p>With two major deep-water ports, short sailing times to Asia, and extensive railroad and warehouse sectors, we're a big player in trade and logistics.</p><p>Corporate headquarters such as Starbucks, Paccar and Costco - plus Microsoft and Amazon - mean decisions get made here, and in some cases corporate stewardship is forthcoming.</p><p>In this sense, metro Seattle is a smaller version of No. 5 Dallas-Plano-Irving. Big D has a lot of nearly everything, with a heavy emphasis on the wellspring of corporate, research and cultural assets.</p><p>I'm not sure these reports can be translated into universal lessons.</p><p>For example, astronomical costs and regulation have yet to sink the Bay Area economy (San Jose was No. 2 and San Francisco was No. 4).</p><p>And the \"business friendly tax and regulatory climate\" of Provo-Orem also includes the benefit of the civic cohesiveness of the region's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints majority, which embraces education (Brigham Young University is in Provo) and hard work. Both cities are on the successful FrontRunner commuter rail system.</p><p>Don't forget: When it came time for Amazon to choose its HQ2, it selected two high-cost, high regulation locales.</p><p>To me, \"business friendly\" means more than tax rates or regulation. It requires an educated workforce, civic and cultural assets, investment in infrastructure and livability, and an environmental and social-justice ethos that attracts the most talented younger workers.</p><p>Ideology is a very limited compass. The quickly repealed jobs tax in Seattle would have been as destructive coming from the left as are cuts to education and infrastructure in red states.</p><p>Best practices can help cities improve their game.</p><p>\"By targeting local sectors with a robust competitive advantage, communities can seek to reduce the impact future dips in the business cycle have on local employment and economic activity,\" the Milken authors write.</p><p>\"Regions that better link education and training programs to the workforce needs of employers will attract businesses and create more opportunities ...,\" they continue. \"Developing new industries and companies will require fostering entrepreneurship and innovation through research institutions, incubators, and funding programs.\"</p><p>All true. But I'm skeptical that Big Tech is spreading its high-end assets beyond the usual suspects, or that one-trick-pony metros (dependent on tourism or retirees) can substantially change their games.</p><p>Just as we went through a Come as You Are Recession - strong places came out strong, weak ones were hurt worst - the same dynamic applies to this expansion.</p><p>No new Detroits are being created, as happened with the Motown manufacturing titan in the early 20th century.</p><p>You can blame a lack of big-employment economic breakthroughs, Wall Street's\u00a0tightfistedness and greed, a globalized economy, lack of public infrastructure investment and uneven American educational outcomes.</p><p>And this is likely as good as it gets, for both\u00a0Seattle and Youngstown, as this aging expansion can't last forever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-50121aba20bd11e98204bca9cec3800d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V91-3CX1-DY2P-41XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 27, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001452</classCode><className>RANKINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Last week, Twitter banned political advertising; European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said she was considering much tougher monopoly standards; the city of Toronto pushed back on Google's Sidewalk project; Australia sued the search giant over alleged misuse of location data; and United States presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called out Facebook's political lobbying as she declared she would end the revolving door between business and policy if she wins the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It has been a long time coming.</p><p> Over the past 20 years, Silicon Valley's largest companies have traced a narrative arc from utopia to dystopia. They have moved from being scrappy, garage-based innovators to surveillance capitalists who profit from personal data and have the power to swing elections and squash even large competitors.</p><p> Their evolution has sparked what I think will be a significant and lasting pushback from politicians and regulators around the world. We are also seeing three crucial shifts that will affect not just Big Tech, but everyone.</p><p> First, we will see fundamental changes in the business model of technology platform firms.</p><p>US tech firms have, since 1996, enjoyed limited liability for anything that users do or say on their platforms. But the ramifications of that - from election manipulation to political populism to the monetisation of online hate and violence - have created a public backlash.</p><p> The US Congress is considering ending, or at least significantly cutting back, those legal loopholes. That would force companies such as Facebook and Google to take more responsibility for their content, as traditional media groups already do.</p><p> In this area, Twitter's decision last Wednesday to ban political advertising marks a major turning point. Chief executive Jack Dorsey explained in a series of tweets from his personal account: \"Paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure might not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.\"</p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg insisted that his company wouldn't be following suit. But I very much doubt that the social media giant will be able to withstand the tsunami of political pressure that's coming.</p><p><br/>Facebook chairman and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg preparing to testify before the United States House Committee on Financial Services during a hearing on Facebook and its impact on the financial services and housing sectors in Washington last month. PHOTO: EPA-EFE<br/></p><p> In a letter to Mr Zuckerberg last week, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a prominent critic of the tech platforms, urged Facebook to follow policies similar to those of cable networks, which can and do refuse to run inaccurate political ads.</p><p> The pressure reflects another shift. For four decades, the private sector has been ascendant, but we are moving to an era in which the public sector will exert more control.</p><p> Many of us expected that turn after the 2008 financial crisis. But it has taken the superstar power exerted by the largest tech platform groups to make it clear just how uncompetitive our supposedly free market system has become.</p><p> The result may be tougher laws against monopolies and new rules about how wealth and power are shared in the digital economy.</p><p> For a sign of how things are shifting, look at the Australian case against Google (one of many worldwide). It accuses the search giant of misleading users about how personal data was collected and used and relies not on privacy law (as many prior cases have) but consumer law, which comes with higher potential penalties. To me, that signals a move towards enforcing not just privacy, but also economic justice.</p><p> In the EU, Ms Vestager is suggesting a seismic change to antitrust law. If adopted, it would require digital platform companies accused of anti-competitive behaviour to demonstrate clear gains for their users. Currently, regulators must show consumer damage. That is one reason it has been so difficult for companies such as Yelp in the US or Foundem in Britain to win antitrust cases against bigger rivals.</p><p> Not only does Big Tech have vastly more legal muscle, but it also controls the black box of data and algorithmic information on which such cases depend.</p><p> Making sure that the digital ecosystem in which big companies, start-ups and users operate is truly fair would be a part of another shift. And this third change would be perhaps the most important, from an era of wealth creation to one of wealth distribution.</p><p> Toronto's insistence that Google's sister firm Sidewalk Labs share more data and intellectual property from its \"smart city\" with both users and the public sector is appropriate and welcome.</p><p> The project would use sensors to monitor citizens' movements around a 5ha waterfront plot. It could lead to more efficient traffic patterns and lower energy consumption. But unless the government controls what is collected and who accesses it, such a project would put too much control in the hands of a single company.</p><p> And that is the heart of the problem.</p><p> The shift towards economic neoliberalism that started in the 1980s created a lot of wealth - but it was concentrated in the hands of too few. It has led to a new Gilded Age in which the political system, particularly in the US, is captured by moneyed interests. That is a key factor in political populism today.</p><p> I don't know if Ms Warren will win the presidency next year. But if she does, I cannot think of a better first move than to put new limits on government officials leveraging contacts for corporate gain.</p><p> US tech firms have, since 1996, enjoyed limited liability for anything that users do or say on their platforms. But the ramifications of that ... have created a public backlash. The US Congress is considering ending, or at least significantly cutting back, those legal loopholes. That would force companies such as Facebook and Google to take more responsibility for their content, as traditional media groups already do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook chairman and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg preparing to testify before the United States House Committee on Financial Services during a hearing on Facebook and its impact on the financial services and housing sectors in Washington last month.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-633957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF0-NNY1-JCF2-8042-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He has sought to radically change US foreign policy in line with his views, over the objections of most of his national security team and institutions including the Pentagon, the State Department, the intelligence community, the Congress, and the public, which polls show has become even more supportive of alliances, free trade, and democracy during his term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President and internationalists within his administration and Congress have fought to a stalemate so far. On the one hand, US alliances remain intact, US forces remain forward-positioned, and the official foreign policy doctrine of the US is oriented around great power competition.</p><p>On the other hand, the President has removed many of the constraints on his freedom of action, he is extremely critical of allies, and the US has abandoned any pretence to leadership in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which is one of the greatest international crises of the past 50 years.</p><p>Several former senior Trump administration officials believe he could strike a devastating blow against internationalists in a second term, effectively dissolving US alliances and formally ending the postwar order.</p><p>This is what makes the election of 2020 even more important than 2016. It is the point of no return. The immune system of the postwar US national security state has been dramatically weakened. If the American people confirm their support for an America First president by giving Trump a second term, this system will break and be replaced by something else.</p><p>Moreover, the international order is especially fragile, reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic recession, along with continued uncertainty about America's role in the world.</p><p>If Trump is re-elected, the rest of the world will conclude that the US has fundamentally changed and the period of postwar leadership is at an end. If Democratic nominee and former vice-president Joe Biden becomes president, the postwar US order will be granted a last-minute reprieve.</p><p>Biden is an enthusiastic advocate of US alliances and American leadership. Will Biden continue down the path of great power competition with China and Russia? Will he take advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to introduce major reforms to the international order, and what will those reforms be?</p><p>Most important of all, can Biden set the stage for a renewal of US leadership, or will history remember his administration as a brief and futile last gasp of the foreign policy establishment, preceded and succeeded by a more durable nationalist alternative?</p><p>The choice between Trump and Biden is so stark and consequential that the two outcomes are unlikely to bear any resemblance to each other. The best guide to Trump's foreign policy is to understand his psychology and disposition, not to study his administration's formal policy documents and actions.</p><p>In his first term, Trump systematically removed the constraints on his freedom of action and installed ultra-loyalists who would indulge his whims and preferences. This will continue and accelerate in a second term because he would view an electoral victory as an utter vindication of his approach.</p><p>He will likely pursue his instincts on alliances, trade, autocrats, and the grandeur of his own role with vigour and few constraints. This could result in dramatic departures from America's traditional postwar policy, including the effective dissolution of NATO and other alliances.</p><p>The question with Biden is not how he is different from Trump. It is whether he will be different from Barack Obama. A series of substantive debates between centrists in the Democratic Party continues an earlier debate inside the Obama administration. The intra-centrist debate has two schools - a restorationist group who holds the world view of Obama, and a reform group that questions some of the basic assumptions of that administration on China, globalisation, the Middle East, and the long-term future of the liberal international order.</p><p>The first half of a Biden term is likely to be defined by a struggle between these two world views. The coronavirus crisis will cast a shadow over all of this and raise fundamental questions about the future of the global economy, co-operation with China, and the future of international institutions.</p><p>If there is a unifying theme among these findings, it is that US foreign policy is in a crisis that is coming to a boiling point. The question is whether those who believe in the tradition of American leadership since World War II receive a reprieve.</p><p>If they do not, will there be anything left by the end of Trump's second term? If they do, how will they handle the opportunity: by reverting to the way things were in 2016, or by doing something dramatically different?</p><p>Trump's visceral beliefs about the world date back to the mid-1980s. He is sceptical of America's alliances, feels that free trade is bad for the US and has a fondness for authoritarian strongmen.</p><p>However, when he unexpectedly won the presidency in 2016, he had a problem. He had paid no attention to how to convert these visceral beliefs into policy and there were very few foreign policy experts who believed what he believed, certainly none who were confirmable by the Senate.</p><p>So he turned to former generals and business leaders, men such as Jim Mattis, John Kelly, H.R. McMaster (after a brief and catastrophic couple of weeks with Michael Flynn), Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn.</p><p>But the \"axis of adults\", as they were quickly labelled, were traditionalists. For the most part, they believed in alliances, democracy, and free trade. They saw their role as placing a check on the President, not satisfying his whims and desires. They sought to constrain his choices and box him in to a \"normal\" foreign policy. When he rebelled - for instance, when he refused to endorse Article 5 in a speech at the new NATO headquarters - they prevailed on him to reverse course.</p><p>Trump was never going to accept a second fiddle role in his own administration and he grew resentful at being managed. As John Bolton notes in his book The Room Where It Happened, the adults were \"so transparently self-serving and so publicly dismissive of many of Trump's very clear goals (whether worthy or unworthy) that they fed Trump's already-suspicious mindset\".</p><p>Trump began to realise that as President he could do things even if his team disagreed. In early 2018, he forced out the axis of adults, replacing Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster with individuals who placed loyalty to the President over their own independent judgment - Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Larry Kudlow. This ushered in the second phase of Trump's presidency - the age of action.</p><p>Trump now acted more freely, pursuing his instincts even when they conflicted with the advice of his officials. He announced talks with Kim Jong-un without consulting his cabinet. He moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He tweeted his response to Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons before talking with his national security team. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium. He held a summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and publicly accepted the Russian President's word on election interference over the unanimous consent of the US intelligence community. He started a trade war with China.</p><p>Bolton effectively abolished the inter-agency process through which the departments of Defence and State and other entities have formal seats at the table where decisions are made. The removal of constraints was complete when Mattis resigned in December 2018 following Trump's promise to withdraw troops from Syria.</p><p>The age of reckoning finally arrived on June 21, 2019, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran in retaliation for their drone attack on a Saudi airfield, and then changed his mind. Trump wanted to shred the Iran nuclear deal and impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. He also wanted to avoid embroiling America in a new conflict in the Middle East. For more than a year, he pretended as if these two goals were not in conflict. When push came to shove, he decided he did not want a new war .</p><p>The same dynamic played out with China. The administration was pursuing a tough and competitive strategy towards Beijing, but Trump was primarily motivated by trade and economics. He never bought into the idea of a full spectrum great power competition - the centrepiece of his national security strategy and national defence strategy. He did not care about regional equilibriums or human rights (according to Bolton, he twice told Xi Jinping he supported the building of concentration camps in Xinjiang). He focused his ire on China's economy. All along he hoped for a deal that would provide an economic benefit that he could sell politically as a major win.</p><p>Trump has always had a dual narrative about his own prowess - where he is both the militarist and the dealmaker. With the election in sight, Trump chose to be a dealmaker so he could prevent his political opponents from describing him as a warmonger during the election campaign. He sought talks with the Iranian leadership in September 2019. He tried to invite the Taliban to Camp David around the time of the 9/11 anniversary. He negotiated a trade deal with China. As an obstacle to this agenda, Bolton was forced out.</p><p>Trump's personality and cognitive traits seem particularly ill-suited to a major crisis. In 2020, the long-awaited crisis finally arrived and it was a whopper - a once-in-a-century pandemic with an economic collapse to rival the Great Depression.</p><p>This catastrophe could have been a political opportunity for another president. He could have set politics aside, told the public he would focus solely on defeating the virus, level with the American people about the severity of the challenge they faced, and present himself as a can-do businessman who would reach across the aisle.</p><p>There is no mystery as to why he did not take that path. It is simply not who he is. In the early weeks, as the coronavirus spread through Wuhan, Trump prioritised the trade deal he had negotiated with China. He dismissed the warnings from his national security and intelligence teams. He praised Xi and expressed the hope the virus would disappear, even though he privately knew it was a major and imminent threat to the US.</p><p>When COVID-19 became impossible to ignore, he reached for an eye-catching policy consistent with the Trump brand - the travel ban on China and subsequently on Europe - and declared victory. This took place on January 31. He did almost nothing else on the coronavirus in February.</p><p>As cases and fatalities rose, Trump oscillated back and forth between bashing China and declaring the crisis over. He showed no interest in convening the international community or co-ordinating a national response. He liked to highlight and exaggerate the failures and tribulations of other countries to portray his own failures in a better light.</p><p>He actively spread disinformation about the virus and the means of treating it. With no rallies and very limited travel or capacity to host visitors, he grew more isolated and volatile on social media.</p><p>This was the first major international emergency since World II War in which the US played no leadership role. The Trump administration could have convened world leaders to co-ordinate travel and economic restrictions, share information, and work on a vaccine.</p><p>Trump administration officials actively undermined the efforts of other nations that tried to fill the vacuum. When France tried to mobilise the G7 and the United Nations Security Council, the Trump administration insisted that these forums formally blame China as a precondition for action - something that doomed the effort before it began.</p><p>Even more disturbing was the Trump administration's attitude towards the World Health Organisation. In January, when Trump was praising China, the WHO was privately alarmed. Internal documents show that senior officials were concerned that China was covering up the virus but that they could not say so publicly in case it reduced China's co-operation even further.</p><p>The US had an opportunity to work with the WHO and the international community to build a coalition to press Beijing for greater transparency and co-operation. Trump temporarily withheld funding from the WHO and set a 30-day deadline for talks with its leadership on reform.</p><p>Just eight days into the 30-day period, and unbeknown to his own officials, Trump announced he was withdrawing formally, dismaying America's allies and empowering Beijing.</p><p>Trump's first term followed a narrative arc of a president shedding constraints, becoming more comfortable wielding power, doing so in line with his own instincts and political interests, and persisting with this even as he encountered trouble and the catastrophic crisis the country is now engulfed in.</p><p>A re-elected Trump will feel fully vindicated. He and his team will be more prepared, both bureaucratically and psychologically, than they were in 2017. They will be willing to push the envelope further.</p><p>In a second term, he could well try to unravel some of America's alliances. He could unilaterally reinterpret Article 5 to effectively destroy NATO (for instance by saying he will not use force to defend any country that does not pay the US directly for providing security). He could withdraw troops from South Korea. While Trump got on well with Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, he could try the same tactic on new leader Yoshihide Suga.</p><p>Second, Trump will choose a team that enables him to behave in this way. He has made it clear he values loyalty above all else. In a second term, Trump has three pools of people from which to draw.</p><p>The first are senior Republican politicians who have been steadfastly loyal to him, such as senators Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, and, of course, Mike Pompeo.</p><p>The second are ultra-loyalists who have no real power base of their own and owe their influence entirely to the President personally. This pool includes people such as former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell and retired US Army officers Anthony Tata and Douglas Macgregor, who came to Trump's attention through their commentary on cable news. It also potentially includes family members, particularly Jared Kushner, Ivanka, and Donald jnr.</p><p>The third group are younger officials who will have gained experience in the first term. The end result will likely be a mix, but the ultra-loyalists are poised to be the most influential.</p><p>That part of the Republican foreign policy establishment that is still on good terms with Trump will try to make the containment of China the centrepiece of Trump's second term, but it is not clear if the President is fully bought into it.</p><p>The problem they have is that Trump is mainly driven by concern about China's economic role. He has no issue with the Chinese Communist Party's domestic authoritarianism, and very limited interest in the geopolitical interests of US allies, including Taiwan.</p><p>A second Trump term will most likely mark the formal end of the post-World World II and post-Cold War international order. We may see bilateral initiatives, but the era of structured and sustained co-operation will be over.</p><p>This will most immediately be felt in the COVID-19 crisis - vaccine nationalism will prevail and there will be little effort to prevent the economic recovery from tilting in a protectionist direction.</p><p>In many ways, Joe Biden is a known quantity when it comes to foreign policy. He believes in American leadership, the liberal international order, democracy, alliances, treaties, and climate change. He has built a tent large enough for Republican never-Trumpers, Democratic centrists (of whom he is one), and progressives.</p><p>He will seek to undo much of what Trump has wrought - he will quickly rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, he will try to revive the Iran nuclear deal, he will work with other nations on combating COVID-19, and he will resume US support for its allies.</p><p>Will his presidency differ in significant ways from that of Obama? There have been hints. Biden has called Saudi Arabia a \"pariah state\". Does that portend a significant change in America's posture in the Middle East? He has taken a tough line on China. So, will he buy into the concept of great power competition? He has argued that globalisation must serve the middle class. Will he be more open to progressive reforms to the global economy?</p><p>Biden knows his connection to Obama is an asset, and no political benefit exists in distancing himself from the former president. In some ways, Obama's scepticism of American activism stemmed from his optimism about American power. He believed that if the US got its own house in order and acted responsibly on the world stage, China, Russia, and other potential challengers would not be able to compete.</p><p>One group of Democrats have not fundamentally changed their world view since the Obama administration. They want to protect American democracy against foreign interference, they are more wary of Russia, and, of course, they recognise COVID-19 as one of the most severe crises to hit the US and the international order over the past 50 years.</p><p>But they also continue to believe that the arc of history favours the US, they are sceptical of military interventionism, they do not want US foreign policy to be defined or constrained by geopolitical competition, even though they accept the US must stand up for its interests against China, and they continue to believe in the benefits of globalisation. This group can be described as restorationist.</p><p>No issue has been more controversial or widely discussed than how the US should approach China.</p><p>In 2018, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden's deputy national security adviser in Obama's second term, published an influential article in Foreign Affairs arguing that some of the key assumptions underpinning China policy in successive administrations - for instance, that commercial engagement with China would lead to economic liberalisation, and that China would become a responsible stakeholder in the international order - were wrong. A year later, Campbell co-authored another article on how the US could take a more competitive approach to China while avoiding confrontation.</p><p>Reformers generally believe that under Xi, China has become more of a dictatorship than an autocratic system where power is shared or at least somewhat limited by a politburo. They also consider that China is becoming more repressive, as demonstrated by the deployment of facial recognition technologies and social credit systems, the widespread use of concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the destruction of Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" model.</p><p>The reformers want the US to adopt a much more competitive strategy than the Obama administration did, but they are preoccupied with the question of how to blend competition and diplomacy so rivalry does not turn into confrontation and conflict, and so some co-operation on shared interests remains possible.</p><p>The reformers worry that the US is falling behind technologically and economically, and they believe major changes to US policy are required to get back into the lead. They want to see competition with China at the heart of America's alliances, including the trans-Atlantic alliance, and they are generally willing to use the China challenge to advocate for domestic policy changes.</p><p>They are open to the possibility of a limited decoupling between the US and China, particularly on technology and supply chains for critical health supplies and other strategically important parts of the economy.</p><p>By contrast, the restorationists tend to be less willing to accept that Xi has transformed China into a different type of regime that is inherently unreasonable and dictatorial. They are less pessimistic about the changes in the distribution of power and oppose using the China threat to mobilise the political system behind domestic changes.</p><p>The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism as a fault line in world politics, a view they share with the progressives. They want the US to make democratic co-operation an organising principle of its foreign policy, partly as a means of competing with China, and partly because they believe that democracy itself is at grave risk.</p><p>They want to work with other free societies to promote liberal norms and to compete with China and Russia in international institutions.</p><p>Restorationists, on the other hand, worry about creating an ideological fault line in world politics that exacerbates competition with China. They see co-operation among democracies as just one piece of a larger diplomatic strategy.</p><p>In an article in early 2020, Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser, and Jennifer Harris, a former Obama administration official, argue for reforming trade deals to target tax havens, prevent currency manipulation, improve wages, and generate investment in the US. Industrial policy should be used to compete with China, particularly in new technologies, and foreign policy should be a part of the antitrust debate on breaking up big tech.</p><p>The Sullivan-Harris agenda is generally aligned with thinking on the progressive side of the Democratic Party. Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy from within as well as from without. To counter it, the US must root out corruption and reform the global economy, including eliminating tax havens, regulating global finance, and tackling inequality.</p><p>Reformers are also willing to use the China challenge, which they believe is real and daunting, to mobilise support for an ambitious economic agenda domestically and internationally.</p><p>The restorationists tend to favour re-engaging in free trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. However, they are reluctant to use responding to China as an organising principle for the policy.</p><p>A Biden administration could take a series of rapid and far-reaching actions early in the term, particularly on climate change, tackling COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism.</p><p>The coronavirus seems to have persuaded the Biden team that their presidency will require a transformative foreign policy in several respects - fighting the virus globally, including developing and fairly distributing a vaccine, reforming and rebuilding international institutions, and rebuilding the national and international economy.</p><p>If Trump wins a second term, the rest of the world will conclude that the US has fundamentally changed and is no longer committed to the traditional leadership role it has played since World War II.</p><p>In Asia, the big question will be whether Trump sticks to his tough China policy or tries to resurrect his trade deal with Xi while also pulling back from America's alliances with South Korea and Japan.</p><p>America's allies are concerned that Trump's brand of containment will preclude any possibility of co-operation with China on shared challenges and that decoupling is impractical and costly for countries that rely on China economically.</p><p>Trump's re-election would initially be broadly welcomed in Israel and the Arab world, where leaders accept his maximum pressure campaign on Iran, his indifference towards democracy and human rights, and his transactional nature. However, Trump has made it clear that he hopes to strike a deal with Iran on its nuclear program and that he has little commitment to supporting the regional order.</p><p>The impact of a Trump victory would be particularly acute in Europe. Trump's re-election would be interpreted by many Europeans as the end of the trans-Atlantic relationship and would serve as a wake-up call for European sovereignty and strategic autonomy, moves which are already slowly under way.</p><p>Australia has handled Trump better than any other liberal democracy, albeit after a rocky start with the terse phone call between then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Trump. As a conservative, Scott Morrison worked well with Trump administration officials and Australia was an early mover on pushing back against Chinese political interference and in placing restrictions on Huawei.</p><p>However, the uncertainty around Trump's commitment to maintaining the regional order in the Asia-Pacific region is a concern for Canberra about a second term. The Australian government is likely to favour Biden taking a tougher approach to China than in the Obama administration.</p><p>A Biden victory would be widely, albeit not universally, greeted with relief and enthusiasm internationally as America's democratic allies will see the US as returning to its traditional role.</p><p>However, they would also assess that Trumpism could make a return in the 2024 election unless the President is defeated by an overwhelming majority.</p><p>The challenge for a President Biden will be whether he can make good use of these four years to firmly place American leadership on a more sustainable footing. Otherwise, his victory may just be a stay of execution for the postwar order.R</p><p>This is an edited extract from a Lowy Institute Analysis paper, The Point of No Return: The 2020 Election and the Crisis of American Foreign Policy, by Thomas Wright, a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7ckdv2gmlszgul5zng6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610D-8CG1-F0J6-J16K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

By focusing on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, the major news outlets are creating the perception that what's happening is the work of a few bad apples. When the reality is that the underlying problem is systemic in nature. It's not just the GOP. </p><p>Political influence operations are a bipartisan affair. According to a number cruncher who worked for the Democrats, the 2012 Obama campaign aggregated almost five times[3] as much Facebook data as Cambridge Analytica. It's just that in Obama's case Facebook execs decided to turn a blind eye. As the source explained, 'they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.' In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Zuckerberg has hired public relations experts[4] and launched an extensive damage control[5] campaign. Note, for example, the tacit assumption baked into the title of Brian Chen's piece[6] in the New York Times: 'How to Protect Yourself (and Your Friends) on Facebook.' Are editors at the Times alleging that users can have their cake and eat it too? Reading down into the article, Chen acknowledges that truly protecting your data would entail deleting your Facebook account. This frank admission underscores the fact that it's nearly impossible for social media users to escape data collection. After all that's how social media companies make their money[7]. Well over a hundred billion dollars per year. Your online activity inside their walled internet gardens as well as your dopamine addiction[8] to 'tweets' and 'likes' are their income stream. What? You thought these online services were free? A miracle of the new economy? Social media's big data collection directly informs Madison Avenue. All that aggregation begets carefully targeted attempts at manipulation (though marketing execs prefer harmless euphemisms like 'educate' and 'inform'). And if that wasn't bad enough, when intelligence services ask to have a gander[9] its dollars to donuts that social media will silently collaborate[10], chatting away with spy masters on a first name basis[11]. Keep moving folks, nothing to see here. So there you have it. Social media is a form of mass surveillance and a tool of elite control. Buy product X, vote for candidate Y, support regime change movement Z. Pay no attention to the CEO behind the curtain[12]. What to do, what to do? In the spirit of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[13]), journalists like Matt Taibbi[14] have suggested that government regulation is the way forward. The idea is that lawmakers should enact laws that force social media companies to 'dial back the use of the data-collection technologies.' Luminaries like Richard Stallman[15] have echoed similar thoughts. And although there's merit to the idea, it's unlikely to be immediately feasible in the United States given the tech industry's lobbying footprint[16]. Companies like Facebook[17] and Google[18] have been more than generous with lawmakers. At best, serious legislative reform is a long term approach that's linked to state capture. At worst it's wishful thinking. Thus we return to Brian Chen's advice: cold turkey. Take personal responsibility for your own social life. Go back to engaging flesh and blood people without tech companies serving as an intermediary. Eschew the narcissistic impulse to broadcast the excruciating minutiae of your life to the world. Refuse to accept the mandate that you must participate in social media in order to participate in society. Reclaim your autonomy. Having said that, the option of forgoing digital platforms in favor of genuine human interaction is related to another legitimate critique of social media; that it tends towards ideological echo chambers[19]. Where people take refuge in the comfort of messaging that serves only to reinforce their existing beliefs. A novel incarnation of the divide and conquer strategy which the power elite have traditionally wielded to hobble the proles. Readers should be wary of social media bubbles, safe spaces, and the like. In the absence of billionaire donors like Robert Mercer[20] and Tom Steyer[21], instituting societal change means reaching out to other folks. Some of whom may have different ways of viewing the world. Resist the temptation to write them off and have the humility to accept the limits of your own understanding.

View original post here[2]. Submitted by Bill Blunden, As the Facebook fracas unfolds, the agenda-setting members of the press have been inclined to frame Cambridge Analytica as an isolated incident. This belies the fact that mass surveillance is a fundamental aspect of social media's business model, and that social media users cannot have their cake and eat it too, despite what tech CEOs might claim. In lieu of regulatory measures, protecting your privacy online entails swallowing a bitter pill: opting out of social media. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/mrz040718-color_1_orig.jpg?itok=Ot1Sr4OR\">https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/mrz040718-color_1_orig.jpg?itok=Ot1Sr4OR</url> While the pool of Facebook accounts suspected of being harvested by Cambridge Analytica continues to grow[3] it's important to recognize that there's more to this story[4] than a cabal of shady republican operators. By focusing on Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, the major news outlets are creating the perception that what's happening is the work of a few bad apples. When the reality is that the underlying problem is systemic in nature. It's not just the GOP. Political influence operations are a bipartisan affair. According to a number cruncher who worked for the Democrats, the 2012 Obama campaign aggregated almost five times[5] as much Facebook data as Cambridge Analytica. It's just that in Obama's case Facebook execs decided to turn a blind eye. As the source explained, 'they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.' In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Zuckerberg has hired public relations experts[6] and launched an extensive damage control[7] campaign. Note, for example, the tacit assumption baked into the title of Brian Chen's piece[8] in the New York Times: 'How to Protect Yourself (and Your Friends) on Facebook.' Are editors at the Times alleging that users can have their cake and eat it too? Reading down into the article, Chen acknowledges that truly protecting your data would entail deleting your Facebook account. This frank admission underscores the fact that it's nearly impossible for social media users to escape data collection. After all that's how social media companies make their money[9]. Well over a hundred billion dollars per year. Your online activity inside their walled internet gardens as well as your dopamine addiction[10] to 'tweets' and 'likes' are their income stream. What? You thought these online services were free? A miracle of the new economy? Social media's big data collection directly informs Madison Avenue. All that aggregation begets carefully targeted attempts at manipulation (though marketing execs prefer harmless euphemisms like 'educate' and 'inform'). And if that wasn't bad enough, when intelligence services ask to have a gander[11] its dollars to donuts that social media will silently collaborate[12], chatting away with spy masters on a first name basis[13]. Keep moving folks, nothing to see here. So there you have it. Social media is a form of mass surveillance and a tool of elite control. Buy product X, vote for candidate Y, support regime change movement Z. Pay no attention to the CEO behind the curtain[14]. What to do, what to do? In the spirit of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[15]), journalists like Matt Taibbi[16] have suggested that government regulation is the way forward. The idea is that lawmakers should enact laws that force social media companies to 'dial back the use of the data-collection technologies.' Luminaries like Richard Stallman[17] have echoed similar thoughts. And although there's merit to the idea, it's unlikely to be immediately feasible in the United States given the tech industry's lobbying footprint[18]. Companies like Facebook[19] and Google[20] have been more than generous with lawmakers. At best, serious legislative reform is a long term approach that's linked to state capture. At worst it's wishful thinking. Thus we return to Brian Chen's advice: cold turkey. Take personal responsibility for your own social life. Go back to engaging flesh and blood people without tech companies serving as an intermediary. Eschew the narcissistic impulse to broadcast the excruciating minutiae of your life to the world. Refuse to accept the mandate that you must participate in social media in order to participate in society. Reclaim your autonomy. Having said that, the option of forgoing digital platforms in favor of genuine human interaction is related to another legitimate critique of social media; that it tends towards ideological echo chambers[21]. Where people take refuge in the comfort of messaging that serves only to reinforce their existing beliefs. A novel incarnation of the divide and conquer strategy which the power elite have traditionally wielded to hobble the proles. Readers should be wary of social media bubbles, safe spaces, and the like. In the absence of billionaire donors like Robert Mercer[22] and Tom Steyer[23], instituting societal change means reaching out to other folks. Some of whom may have different ways of viewing the world. Resist the temptation to write them off and have the humility to accept the limits of your own understanding.

This week was the first for me working fully from home and I was struck by how many companies are trying to solve issues during this lockdown phase \u2014 and some are even getting rewarded by investors with more capital (see Art of the deal). Don't miss the Brookings report on how China is rapidly increasing investments in India in the Sages section \u2014 an important theme this year even with coronavirus.

Huawei, one of the main blacklisted Chinese companies, managed to purchase $18.7bn in US components last year \u2014 up by 70 per cent from the previous year, chairman Eric Xu told the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a0ed8d-c77a-4acd-93d5-676a656a2a0a\"> FT in an interview.</url></p><p>The surge came in spite of the fact that Huawei was added to the sanctions list in May last year. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3716c4bb-de27-4920-ab87-46a8a2758ddf\"> An FT teardown</url> of Huawei\u2019s P40 Pro smartphone, launched in March this year, shows several important US components (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">see also Smart data below)</emphasis> inside the phone.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications: </emphasis>It is well known that the US government granted a \u201ctemporary general licence\u201d to its companies, allowing them to sell US-origin items to Huawei to service existing products. But this general licence does not cover sales to new products such as the P40 smartphone.</p><p>For such new products, companies selling US-origin items must seek individual licences from the American commerce department, which has not divulged which ones it has granted.

It concerns the notification and documentation of a personal data breach.</p><p>The draft decision, which has been submitted to other concerned EU supervisory authorities, is one of a number of significant developments in DPC inquiries into \"big tech\" companies this week.</p><p>The commission is also examining whether WhatsApp Ireland is in compliance with the GDPR in relation to transparency, including what information is shared with Facebook.</p><p>It has also completed the investigation phase of a complaint-based inquiry on Facebook Ireland's obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing but has yet to make a decision.</p><p>[readmore]1001257[/readmore]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKNEW-1001267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRKNEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYM-FD31-JCW9-21SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><timeReceived>10:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The DPC's first fine of (EURO)75,000 was also against Tusla.</p><p>Tusla reported the most recent case to the DPC last November. The agency confirmed last week that it would not be appealing against the fine, of which it had been notified earlier this month. Details of the case are set out in a two-year review of the DPC's handling of GDPR, published last week.</p><p>The report said the data breach occurred 29 weeks prior to Tusla reporting it to the DPC. As well as finding that Tusla had failed to implement organisational measures to prevent the inadvertent release of the sensitive letter, it said the Tusla had breached GDPR by delaying notifying the DPC of the breach.</p><p>In its two-year review of GDPR, which brought in a new range of data protection rules and made the DPC the lead EU regulator for tech companies based in Ireland, the commission said it had received 12,500 breach notifications and 95% of those cases were now closed.</p><p>It said six Big Tech projects, including Facebook's dating app, had been postponed or revised following its intervention. It has opened 24 investigations into Big Tech companies, 11 of which involve Facebook or its subsidiaries. A draft decision on an investigation into a data breach at Twitter has been circulated to other EU authorities.</p><p>The review also sets out how DPC action caused gardai to disable the use of number-plate recognition software from CCTV cameras deployed in Duleek and Donore in Co Meath. The DPC found CCTV cameras with pan, tilt and zoom functions were \"routinely\" left focused on private homes. In Donore, one camera was inadvertently focused on the front door of a local priest's house so \"his comings and goings and those of any visitors to his house were permanently on view at Ashbourne garda station\".</p><p>A DPC investigation into use of CCTV schemes by all local authorities has found a number of breaches of GDPR. Kerry county council has issued Circuit Court action to appeal against the DPC's findings.</p><p>The DPC has been criticised by some privacy experts for the slow pace of action in its Big Tech investigations.

The DPC's first fine of (EURO)75,000 was also against Tusla.</p><p>Tusla reported the most recent case to the DPC last November. The agency confirmed last week that it would not be appealing against the fine, of which it had been notified earlier this month. Details of the case are set out in a two-year review of the DPC's handling of GDPR, published last week.</p><p>The report said the data breach occurred 29 weeks prior to Tusla reporting it to the DPC. As well as finding that Tusla had failed to implement organisational measures to prevent the inadvertent release of the sensitive letter, it said the Tusla had breached GDPR by delaying notifying the DPC of the breach.</p><p>In its two-year review of GDPR, which brought in a new range of data protection rules and made the DPC the lead EU regulator for tech companies based in Ireland, the commission said it had received 12,500 breach notifications and 95% of those cases were now closed. It said six Big Tech projects, including Facebook's dating app, had been postponed or revised following its intervention. It has opened 24 investigations into Big Tech companies, 11 of which involve Facebook or its subsidiaries. A draft decision on an investigation into a data breach at Twitter has been circulated to other EU authorities.</p><p>The review also sets out how DPC action caused gardai to disable the use of number-plate recognition software from CCTV cameras deployed in Duleek and Donore in Co Meath. The DPC found CCTV cameras with pan, tilt and zoom functions were \"routinely\" left focused on private homes. In Donore, one camera was inadvertently focused on the front door of a local priest's house so \"his comings and goings and those of any visitors to his house were permanently on view at Ashbourne garda station\".</p><p>A DPC investigation into use of CCTV schemes by all local authorities has found a number of breaches of GDPR. Kerry county council has issued Circuit Court action to appeal against the DPC's findings.</p><p>The DPC has been criticised by some privacy experts for the slow pace of action in its Big Tech investigations.

Even streaming device Roku now sells ads, adding more competition for legacy television networks.</p><p>Comcast s NBCUniversal and Fox have said they would cut their advertising load, or the number of advertisements during dramas and entertainment shows, as viewers expect a more enjoyable viewing experience   one not cluttered by a parade of ads. Comcast also has launched an advanced advertising group in New York to target television ads to audiences.</p><p> The ad dollars follow the audience and the TV audience is declining. I don t think there is a reason to sugarcoat this,  Paul Verna, principal analyst for video at eMarketer, said in a recent interview.\u00a0 I don t think you are looking at a dying industry,  Verna said.  We are looking at a shift. </p><p>According to eMarketer, television advertising fell 1.5 percent in 2017 to $70.2 billion and will drop 0.5 percent this year, in addition to a 1 percent decline in 2019.</p><p>Facebook\u00a0has come under attack in Washington for allowing the unauthorized use of personal data to target political ads during the 2016 election. Lawmakers could regulate some areas of digital privacy and big tech-company stocks have taken a beating, in part over concern about data-mining and whether government would impose regulations. But eMarketer doesn t believe the scandal will change the broader dynamic of media ads growing on digital platforms.</p><p>Comcast has merged into one office in New York ad-technology companies Strata, Visible World, and FreeWheel. The idea is,  How do we bring TV to where digital is?  a Comcast spokesman said.               Comcast Corp.       Marcien Jenckes, president of advertising for Comcast Cable.       </p><p>David Clark, the former president of the Weather Channel, has been hired as executive vice president of Comcast s Advanced Advertising Group, based in New York.

Even streaming device Roku now sells ads, adding more competition for legacy television networks.</p><p>Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox have said they would cut their advertising load, or the number of advertisements during dramas and entertainment shows, as viewers expect a more enjoyable viewing experience -- one not cluttered by a parade of ads. Comcast also has launched an advanced advertising group in New York to target television ads to audiences.</p><p>\"The ad dollars follow the audience and the TV audience is declining. I don't think there is a reason to sugarcoat this,\" Paul Verna, principal analyst for video at eMarketer, said in a recent interview. \"I don't think you are looking at a dying industry,\" Verna said. \"We are looking at a shift.\"</p><p>According to eMarketer, television advertising fell 1.5 percent in 2017 to $70.2 billion and will drop 0.5 percent this year, in addition to a 1 percent decline in 2019.</p><p>Facebookhas come under attack in Washington for allowing the unauthorized use of personal data to target political ads during the 2016 election. Lawmakers could regulate some areas of digital privacy and big tech-company stocks have taken a beating, in part over concern about data-mining and whether government would impose regulations. But eMarketer doesn't believe the scandal will change the broader dynamic of media ads growing on digital platforms.</p><p>Comcast has merged into one office in New York ad-technology companies Strata, Visible World, and FreeWheel. The idea is, \"How do we bring TV to where digital is?\" a Comcast spokesman said.</p><p>David Clark, the former president of the Weather Channel, has been hired as executive vice president of Comcast's Advanced Advertising Group, based in New York. Marcien Jenckes, the president of advertising for Comcast Cable in Philadelphia, is heading the company's overall advertising effort.</p><p>Comcast noted in its recent annual report advertising revenue decreased in 2017 because of the \"impact of continued declines in audience ratings at our networks.\" Those advertising declines were partly offset by higher ad prices at NBC, the company said.</p><p>EMarketer projects that digital platforms -- Google, Facebook, and others -- accounted for 43.6 percent of total media ad spending in 2016. That's expected to grow to 56.8 percent by 2020 and 62.1 percent by 2022.</p><p>___ (c)2018 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20180402-PHI-TV-ads-continue-to-slump-as-money-flows-to-Google-Facebook-0402-20180402PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S17-4H51-JC6P-C4WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 2, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Even streaming device Roku now sells ads, adding more competition for legacy television networks.</p><p>Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox have said they would cut their advertising load, or the number of advertisements during dramas and entertainment shows, as viewers expect a more enjoyable viewing experience-one not cluttered by a parade of ads. Comcast also has launched an advanced advertising group in New York to target television ads to audiences.</p><p> \"The ad dollars follow the audience and the TV audience is declining. I don't think there is a reason to sugarcoat this,\" Paul Verna, principal analyst for video at eMarketer, said in a recent interview. \"I don't think you are looking at a dying industry,\" Verna said. \"We are looking at a shift.\"</p><p> According to eMarketer, television advertising fell 1.5 percent in 2017 to $70.2 billion and will drop 0.5 percent this year, in addition to a 1 percent decline in 2019.</p><p>Facebookhas come under attack in Washington for allowing the unauthorized use of personal data to target political ads during the 2016 election. Lawmakers could regulate some areas of digital privacy and big tech-company stocks have taken a beating, in part over concern about data-mining and whether government would impose regulations. But eMarketer doesn't believe the scandal will change the broader dynamic of media ads growing on digital platforms.</p><p>Comcast has merged into one office in New York ad-technology companies Strata, Visible World, and FreeWheel. The idea is, \"How do we bring TV to where digital is?\" a Comcast spokesman said.</p><p> David Clark, the former president of the Weather Channel, has been hired as executive vice president of Comcast's Advanced Advertising Group, based in New York. Marcien Jenckes, the president of advertising for Comcast Cable in Philadelphia, is heading the company's overall advertising effort.</p><p>Comcast noted in its recent annual report advertising revenue decreased in 2017 because of the \"impact of continued declines in audience ratings at our networks.\" Those advertising declines were partly offset by higher ad prices at NBC, the company said.</p><p>EMarketer projects that digital platforms-Google, Facebook, and others-accounted for 43.6 percent of total media ad spending in 2016. That's expected to grow to 56.8 percent by 2020 and 62.1 percent by 2022.</p><p>Philly.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVA-CVA0024409364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1149310EBD27 NWBKVA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1N-7H11-DXVP-V2YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Free Lance-Star, Fredericksburg, VA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

''That's what the [expletive] serving in Congress has come to,'' one unnamed member of Congress said. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Colbert was outraged -- but he couldn't help but feel some solidarity. ''Waiting for Trump to tweet so you can find out what your job is that day? That's also what the [expletive] hosting a talk show has come to,'' he deadpanned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We're nearly two years into the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>and late-night television remains obsessed. Almost every day of the week, the late-night indignation machine seizes on some new comment from Trump, then feeds its interpretations back into a news cycle that Trump himself -- a devoted TV watcher -- consumes.</p><p>  The ouroboros effect is real.</p><p>  I've covered late-night TV four nights a week since February 2017, in our Best of Late Night column. In 2018, a few lessons emerged.</p><p>  Trump's Twitter account giveth, and it giveth some more</p><p>  [Video: Someone Forgot To Explain Trump's Position On FISA To Trump Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  The president's off-the-cuff, often-vitriolic Twitter feed is the hosts' most consistent source of comic material. In January, Trump seemed to contradict himself with a series of tweets about the Russia investigation, then capped one message with, ''Get smart!'' It was perfect bait for Colbert.</p><p>  ''We need to get smart? You're the only one live-tweeting a debate with yourself -- that you're losing.'' -- <person><nameText>STEPHEN COLBERT</nameText></person></p><p>  Months later, after waffling for days, Trump took to Twitter to announce that he'd scuttled a planned meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, using typically extravagant language. <person><nameText>James Corden </nameText></person>made fun of him for that.</p><p>  ''Trump canceled the meeting with North Korea over their, quote, 'tremendous anger and open hostility,' which is ironic, considering 'Tremendous Anger and Open Hostility' is Trump's 2020 campaign slogan.'' -- <person><nameText>JAMES CORDEN</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>Samantha Bee </nameText></person>is a journalist</p><p>  [Video: Voter Suppression | October 17, 2018 Act 2 | Full Frontal on TBS Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  The line between reportage and entertainment has blurred over the past two years. Viewers of John Oliver's ''Last Week Tonight'' on Sundays know that he often gets deep into the policy weeds. (Best of Late Night only covers weekday shows.) For late-nights hosts broadcasting every night, it can be hard to match that amount of research.</p><p>  But <person><nameText>Samantha Bee </nameText></person>only broadcasts on Wednesdays, and usually includes at least one lengthy investigative segment in each show.</p><p>  In June, she sent the correspondent Allana Harkin to Ireland to report on a recent victory for abortion-rights advocates. And in October, she explored the various techniques being used by Republicans to make voting more difficult, now that the Supreme Court has weakened the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>  ''Voters who actually like Republican ideas are dwindling. To stay in power the GOP is using techniques like gerrymandering, blocking judicial appointments and voter suppression -- otherwise known as Mitch McConnell's version of the 'Devil's Triangle.''' -- <person><nameText>SAMANTHA BEE, </nameText></person>referring to a phrase used by a high school-aged Brett Kavanaugh</p><p>  You don't need to impersonate Trump to roast him. But it helps</p><p>  [Video: Donald Trump's Halloween Message to America Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  Colbert, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon have all mastered the art of the Trump impression: grimacing, sandy-voiced and full of jerky hand gestures.</p><p>  Jimmy Fallon has caught flak for his reluctance to hammer the president on substantive issues, and it's true that he treats Trump in a way that reflects how late-night hosts used to deal with past presidents: He portrays Trump as quirky and confused, but rarely expresses real consternation. Fallon's funniest moments often come when he impersonates Trump. On Halloween, he played the president as a tanning-addicted Dracula.</p><p>  ''I was able to save the taxpayers money by reusing the cape from my costume last year, when I was the Count from Sesame Street. 'There were one million, two million, three million people at my inauguration!''' -- JIMMY FALLON</p><p>  Some hosts never perfected a Trump impersonation. Instead, Jimmy Kimmel and <person><nameText>Samantha Bee </nameText></person>in particular often use a different tactic: the un-joke. Without relying on parody, it can be hard to find a way to make humor out of Trump's unorthodox conduct. So they just go slack-jawed, and enact the amazement that many viewers feel.</p><p>  [Video: Donald Trump Furious Over Ivanka's Emails Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  After it was revealed in November that Ivanka Trump used a private email server for White House business, Kimmel said: ''Sometimes the jokes write themselves.'' Then he allowed the president to handle his own impersonation: He played back tape from the 2016 campaign, when Trump pilloried Hillary Clinton for using a private email server.</p><p>  Enigmas can be funny, too</p><p>  [Video: Melania's Jacket &amp; Charlottesville Nazis Return | The Daily Show Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  Melania Trump's tenure as first lady is being defined largely by her inscrutability. In June, she made news in the worlds of fashion and politics with one fell, silent swoop: While traveling to meet migrant children who had been separated from their parents, she wore a Zara jacket emblazoned with the words ''I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?'' The message might have been intended for the media, but Noah joked that it sounded like something she'd say to the president.</p><p>  ''It is kind of sweet that she made a jacket out of her and Donald's wedding vows.'' -- TREVOR NOAH</p><p>  Non-Trump humor was like water in the desert</p><p>  [Video: Conan Reports Russian Election Results Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  Some of the best laughs of the year came from timely jokes that had nothing to do with Trump. These now feel like a vintage commodity, nearly lost in an era after Jay Leno and David Letterman.</p><p>  ''In Indiana, police found a man at a White Castle with a container of dangerous chemicals. Yeah, a man at a White Castle with dangerous chemicals is known as the cook.'' -- CONAN O'BRIEN</p><p>  ''Today is the first official day of summer. Right now everyone's thinking, 'I'm going to hike, I'm going to go camping, I'm going to hit the beach.' While Netflix is like, 'Sure you are.''' -- JIMMY FALLON</p><p>  ''Kim Kardashian and Kanye West celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary today. 'I love you more than ever,' said Kanye to a mirror.'' -- SETH MEYERS</p><p>  Late-night loves mocking Facebook almost as much as it does Trump</p><p>  [Video: Stephen Analyticizes Cambridge Analytica Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  This has been a tough year for Facebook, as it has shown a reluctance to be truthful with the public about how it handles users' data. It came out in March that the right-wing strategists at Cambridge Analytica illicitly gained access to 50 million users' personal information. Facebook didn't immediately notify users when it found out -- which irritated Colbert.</p><p>  ''Really? The one time I actually would have wanted a Facebook alert. Perhaps that could have replaced one of the four messages I get a day about my ex-roommate's college girlfriend's one-woman show. I'm a maybe, Sarah. That means no!'' -- <person><nameText>STEPHEN COLBERT</nameText></person></p><p>  Back in April, when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before Congress, Noah pointed to a root cause. He said that members of Congress who receive gobs of campaign cash from tech giants, and are lobbied by them constantly on Capitol Hill, seem unwilling to regulate the companies.</p><p>  ''Congress has to deal with big corporations the way rich white people punish their kids. 'Young man, there's going to be consequences for this! Now you go to one of your bedrooms and figure out what the consequences should be. And give me your iPhone! Here's the newer one.''' -- TREVOR NOAH</p><p>  And this week, after a New York Times report revealed that Facebook had been sharing users' data with other big tech companies without the users' consent, Jimmy Fallon joked that maybe this was Facebook's idea of generosity.</p><p>  ''You guys, it's the holiday season and everyone is in the giving spirit. In fact, Facebook just gave away all of your private information. Isn't that nice?'' -- JIMMY FALLON</p><p>  Sometimes happy-go-lucky beats snarky</p><p>  [Video: Paul McCartney Carpool Karaoke Watch on YouTube.]</p><p><person><nameText>James Corden, </nameText></person>as any viewer figures out pretty quickly, is not a stand-up comedian. His affect toggles from bubbly and sweet (''You're the best!'' he tells almost every guest) to campy super-seriousness (especially when he's reconnecting with his stage-acting roots).</p><p>  One of Corden's favorite things to do, now as ever, is sing. And his Carpool Karaoke skits have continued to provide a needed bit of respite from the onslaught of political outrage that dominates the rest of late-night TV.

The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&amp;T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.</p><p>  The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers -- in the media industry and beyond -- will be permitted in the years to come.</p><p>  ''This court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,'' said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. ''This case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.''</p><p>  The Justice Department's move to block the deal in November took Wall Street and the entertainment industry by surprise. Many executives and lawyers thought President Trump's administration would usher in a hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, despite Mr. Trump's criticism of the deal on the campaign trail.</p><p>  Instead, the Justice Department, under its antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, moved aggressively, demanding the sale of major parts of the businesses before a deal could go through. AT&amp;T responded by suggesting that Mr. Delrahim's decision was politically motivated and not based on established antitrust law.</p><p>  In recent weeks, though, the judge overseeing the case, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, has rejected moves by AT&amp;T to inject politics into the arguments.</p><p>  Unless the two sides settle -- and there have been no signs of that happening -- the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country's video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&amp;T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks -- and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.</p><p>  The Justice Department argues that the merged company's combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls ''must-watch'' programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.</p><p>  The government's case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&amp;T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming -- the same combination that AT&amp;T is seeking -- would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.</p><p>  Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast's merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast's holdings.</p><p>  ''Either important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,'' the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. ''Or it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.''</p><p>AT&amp;T scoffs at the government's predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government's theory that it would withhold content, AT&amp;T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.</p><p>  Leading AT&amp;T's defense is Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles-based lawyer with a long track record in high-profile cases but not someone who is considered an antitrust expert. Two decades ago, he won a wrongful death case against O. J. Simpson on behalf of the family of Ron Goldman. In 2006, he lost a case defending Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, of fraud and conspiracy.</p><p>  Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&amp;T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.</p><p>AT&amp;T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&amp;T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.</p><p>  ''The new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,'' AT&amp;T said in its pretrial brief.</p><p>  The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&amp;T's control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don't own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.</p><p>  Streaming competition is the ''best hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,'' said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.</p><p>  Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government's intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.</p><p>  ''The government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,'' said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham &amp; Company.</p><p>AT&amp;T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&amp;T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference -- which it described as ''selective enforcement'' -- from the case.</p><p>  But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.</p><p>  The decision to block a merger between companies that don't directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals -- getting companies to promise they'll be on their best behavior -- is not effective.</p><p>  That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS's $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna -- as well as proposed media deals like Disney's acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting's purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.</p><p>  ''This could direct the future path of the industry,'' said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. ''If it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Makan Delrahim (PHOTOGRAPH BY STEPHEN VOSS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B2) DRAWING (DRAWING BY MINH UONG/THE NEW YORK TIMES)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-012530180316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWC-B1G1-DXY4-X1CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html</url><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002OSQ</classCode><className>CABLE NEWS NETWORK LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

In 2020, their minority government must figure out how to implement that ambitious innovation agenda. Along with Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, who will remain the key government player on much of the file, here are the cabinet members, public servants and private-sector players most likely to have an impact on federal business and technology policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">? Simon Kennedy: Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Economic Development Canada (ISED) The department's public-service head took over in September, after four years leading Health Canada. He was deputy minister for international trade during the closing stages of Canada's treaties with the European Union and South Korea. Such markets are key to the Liberal government's $1.1-billion plan to diversify the countries to which Canadian firms sell and increase exports by 50 per cent by 2025. Technology is one target for growth, though the sector's trade performance has lagged behind other countries in recent years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As deputy minister, Kennedy is in what one source familiar with the government's agenda called \"a really important role to listen to industry, but also understand where industry's weaknesses are.\"</p><p>His experience negotiating international agreements and handling complex files - like health funding agreements with the provinces and territories, and cannabis legalization - will be assets for the stakeholder relations-heavy business of ISED. It was the most-lobbied department in each of the last four years, and its deputy minister typically tops government relations professionals'meeting lists.</p><p>? Michelle Rempel Garner: Conservative shadow minister for Industry &amp;; Economic Development</p><p>? Brian Masse: NDP critic for Innovation, Science &amp;; Industry The October election that reduced the Liberals to a minority government cost them control of the House of Commons'standing committees, which scrutinize legislation and investigate issues related to their mandates. That gives opposition critics Rempel Garner and Masse considerable power to amend legislation or push investigations via the industry, science and technology committee.</p><p>Calgary MP Rempel Garner has wasted little time stepping into her new critic portfolio, claiming the government hasn't made any meaningful changes to privacy and data rules and asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to lay out his plan for mobile virtual network operators - a type of challenger wireless carrier that Bains has been tasked with helping expand in Canada. During the Conservatives'last stint in government she led Western Economic Diversification Canada, one of the federal government's six regional development agencies, and previously ran a research and technology commercialization program at the University of Calgary.</p><p>Masse returns as the NDP's innovation critic, and has called for more details on the government's digital charter, a set of 10 high-level principles announced in May 2019. The Windsor, Ont., MP will have a special focus on telecommunications policy; NDP leader Jagmeet Singh named reducing cellphone bills as one of his six priorities for this parliament.</p><p>? Colin McKay: head of public policy &amp;; government relations, Google Canada</p><p>? Kevin Chan: head of public policy, Facebook Canada</p><p>? Michele Austin: head of government &amp;; public policy, Twitter Canada All three of these Big Tech lobbyists are experienced Ottawa insiders. McKay, the longest-tenured, moved to Google in 2011 from an executive role in the federal privacy commissioner's office. Chan started at Facebook in 2014; he was a senior policy adviser to then-Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff between 2009 and 2011 after a stint as an aide to the Clerk of the Privy Council. Austin, a former chief of staff to Conservative ministers Rona Ambrose and Maxime Bernier, joined Twitter in April 2018 from government relations firm Summa Strategies.</p><p>The trio have been frequent visitors to Parliament Hill, testifying at parliamentary committees'hearings on online hate, privacy breaches and copyright rules. And as The Logic reported in July 2019, foreign tech giants more than tripled their government relations activity in Ottawa under the Liberals. Google, Facebook and Twitter sought discussions on topics like NAFTA's intellectual property and digital trade measures and the laws governing online political ads.</p><p>They'll be no less busy in 2020. The Liberals are promising major Big Tech regulations, including rules to \"better protect people's personal data and to encourage greater competition in the digital marketplace,\" overseen by a new data commissioner.</p><p>Atop the agenda are new penalties for social media platforms that fail to \"remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours\" - a provision that's likely to apply to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google's YouTube.</p><p>Last summer, all three companies told the House justice committee they wanted to co-operate with the government to stop the spread of hateful and extremist messages online. But McKay called for more international co-ordination, claiming it's difficult to follow individual rules in different countries; Chan said setting specific takedown timelines risks turning the platforms into censors; and Austin called for clear transparency standards against which platforms can be measured.</p><p>Big Tech also faces bigger tax bills from Ottawa. The Liberals have promised a three-per-cent value-added tax on Canadian sales of online ads and user data for businesses with domestic revenues of $40 million or more, and at least $1 billion globally. It's scheduled to take effect in April 2020. U.S. tech industry groups including the Internet Association - of which Twitter, Facebook and Google are members - have called on the Trump administration to pressure Ottawa to drop it. In November 2019, all three firms updated their lobbying registration to include the measure; both Twitter and Google have already met with senior Finance Canada officials responsible for tax policy.</p><p>? Steven Guilbeault: Minister of Canadian Heritage The rookie MP shares responsibility with Bains for many of the most important innovation files. Top of their joint to-do list is deciding which suggestions to take from the government-appointed panel reviewing the federal broadcasting and telecommunications laws, which will deliver its conclusions by the end of the month.</p><p>Guilbeault will be expected to deliver early symbolic wins as part of the Liberals'beefed-up stance on Big Tech. He's responsible for the social media takedown regulations, and has until the end of this year to introduce legislation requiring online content platforms to host and pay to create \"meaningful levels\" of Canadian material.</p><p>The heritage minister and his counterparts at Innovation and Justice are also working on new online rights for consumers, including data portability and the right to withdraw their personal information from tech firms.</p><p>Before running for the Liberals in Montreal in the October 2019 election, Guilbeault was best-known as an environmental activist, and he spent part of the new Parliament's first two sitting weeks deflecting reporters'questions about climate change and energy legislation to other cabinet members. As the government focuses on clean technology and greening the economy, he could play a role as a member of the economy and environment cabinet committee.</p><p>? Joyce Murray: Minister of Digital Government Murray will be the first full-time cabinet member for the federal technology infrastructure. She's tasked with overseeing the \"transition to a more digital government in order to improve citizen service.\"</p><p>Government departments are testing artificial intelligence and blockchain for tasks like tracking regulations and identity verification, while teams like the Canadian Digital Service work to replace paper-based processes, like rescheduling a citizenship test, with online ones. The government has also established new guidelines for its technology use, launching a risk-assessment tool for automated decision-making and a data strategy.</p><p>Murray has been put in charge of Shared Services Canada, Ottawa's IT department, and is also tasked with preventing repeats of high-profile technology project failures, such as that of the Phoenix payroll system, which caused significant HR and budgetary problems, or the rollout of the unified canada.ca email service, which was downsized after falling more than a year behind schedule. She's responsible for the in-progress search for a Phoenix replacement, and setting up a new \"centre of expertise\" that will advise on buying and installing big new technology systems.</p><p>? Mona Nemer: Chief Science Adviser</p><p>? Will Amos: Parliamentary Secretary for Science to the Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Industry Science had its own dedicated minister in the last Parliament; this time around, the Liberals have rolled it into Bains's portfolio. But the breadth of the innovation minister's responsibilities could mean bigger supporting roles for Nemer and Amos.</p><p>Bains's mandate letter tasks him and the chief science adviser with making the government's research publicly available, and pushing for scientific analysis to factor into decision-making.</p><p>Unmentioned were several big files left on former science minister Kirsty Duncan's desk, including a $2.8-billion program for federal laboratories announced in the 2018 budget, and a plan to replace piecemeal funding for third-party science organizations with a new Strategic Science Fund, revealed in the 2019 edition.</p><p>Science advocates are also pushing the government to finish implementing the recommendations of a 2017 review led by David Naylor, former president of the University of Toronto. While Ottawa increased funding to the three federal councils that award research grants and to graduate scholarship programs over the last two budgets, it provided less than two-thirds of the recommended money. It has not adopted other recommendations, like a parliamentary committee on research facilities.</p><p>One the Liberals did implement was the appointment of a chief science adviser. Nemer, a medical researcher who's served as vice-president of research at the University of Ottawa, was named to the post in September 2017. She's provided input on the federal labs program from the 2018 budget and is working to set up positions like her own within federal departments and agencies.</p><p>? Matthew Boswell: Commissioner of Competition Boswell has steered the agency in a tech-focused direction since his March appointment, prioritizing the digital economy, telecommunications and biosciences sectors and picking \"high-impact and consumer-focused\" cases in a bid to ensure competition and innovation in the market.</p><p>His competition bureau has already forced its first divestment, when U.S. private equity firm Thoma Bravo agreed to sell one of its two portfolio companies making reporting and valuation software for oil and gas software firms in August 2019. It has also sealed an interim agreement with Montreal-based FlightHub as part of a hidden-fees investigation and warned nearly 100 companies to review their influencer campaigns to ensure they're following the law on paid promotions.</p><p>In May, Bains asked Boswell to review Canada's competition and enforcement practices to ensure they account for technology-driven issues like digital transformation and data accumulation and control.</p><p>? Robert Ghiz: CEO, Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association The Liberals made cellphone bill reductions one of the key pocketbook issues in their re-election campaign. While the government is hoping telecoms will make the 25-per-cent cuts on their own, they've paired their call for co-operation with the threat of increased competition via MVNOs.</p><p>But the industry hasn't embraced the target, nor does it seem eager to accept the alternative.</p><p>The Big Three telecom firms - Rogers, BCE Inc.'s Bell and Telus - have previously opposed proposals to require them to sell network access to challenger carriers at set prices, arguing that such rules would reduce the incentive to build wireless infrastructure. They've also argued that Canada is already a competitive market.</p><p>The incumbents are reportedly preparing a lobbying push against the Liberals' plans. They're well represented in Ottawa: the Big Three between them have at least a dozen staff who spend a fifth or more of their time lobbying, and have at least as many outside government relations consultants registered to lobby on their behalf.</p><p>But as the wireless industry's chief lobbyist, Ghiz, a former Liberal staffer and P.E.I. premier, has taken the lead in responding to the government proposals.</p><p>For more news about the innovation economy visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thelogic.co\">www.thelogic.co</url> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In 2020, their minority government must figure out how to implement that ambitious innovation agenda. Along with Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, who will remain the key government player on much of the file, here are the cabinet members, public servants and private-sector players most likely to have an impact on federal business and technology policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">? Simon Kennedy: Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Economic Development Canada (ISED) The department's public-service head took over in September, after four years leading Health Canada. He was deputy minister for international trade during the closing stages of Canada's treaties with the European Union and South Korea. Such markets are key to the Liberal government's $1.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1-billion plan to diversify the countries to which Canadian firms sell and increase exports by 50 per cent by 2025. Technology is one target for growth, though the sector's trade performance has lagged behind other countries in recent years.</p><p>As deputy minister, Kennedy is in what one source familiar with the government's agenda called \"a really important role to listen to industry, but also understand where industry's weaknesses are.\"</p><p>His experience negotiating international agreements and handling complex files - like health funding agreements with the provinces and territories, and cannabis legalization - will be assets for the stakeholder relations-heavy business of ISED. It was the most-lobbied department in each of the last four years, and its deputy minister typically tops government relations professionals'meeting lists.</p><p>? Michelle Rempel Garner: Conservative shadow minister for Industry &amp;; Economic Development ? Brian Masse: NDP critic for Innovation, Science &amp;; Industry The October election that reduced the Liberals to a minority government cost them control of the House of Commons'standing committees, which scrutinize legislation and investigate issues related to their mandates. That gives opposition critics Rempel Garner and Masse considerable power to amend legislation or push investigations via the industry, science and technology committee.</p><p>Calgary MP Rempel Garner has wasted little time stepping into her new critic portfolio, claiming the government hasn't made any meaningful changes to privacy and data rules and asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to lay out his plan for mobile virtual network operators - a type of challenger wireless carrier that Bains has been tasked with helping expand in Canada. During the Conservatives'last stint in government she led Western Economic Diversification Canada, one of the federal government's six regional development agencies, and previously ran a research and technology commercialization program at the University of Calgary.</p><p>Masse returns as the NDP's innovation critic, and has called for more details on the government's digital charter, a set of 10 high-level principles announced in May 2019. The Windsor, Ont., MP will have a special focus on telecommunications policy; NDP leader Jagmeet Singh named reducing cellphone bills as one of his six priorities for this parliament. ? Colin McKay: head of public policy &amp;; government relations, Google Canada ? Kevin Chan: head of public policy, Facebook Canada</p><p>? Michele Austin: head of government &amp;; public policy, Twitter Canada All three of these Big Tech lobbyists are experienced Ottawa insiders. McKay, the longest-tenured, moved to Google in 2011 from an executive role in the federal privacy commissioner's office. Chan started at Facebook in 2014; he was a senior policy adviser to then-Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff between 2009 and 2011 after a stint as an aide to the Clerk of the Privy Council. Austin, a former chief of staff to Conservative ministers Rona Ambrose and Maxime Bernier, joined Twitter in April 2018 from government relations firm Summa Strategies.</p><p>The trio have been frequent visitors to Parliament Hill, testifying at parliamentary committees'hearings on online hate, privacy breaches and copyright rules. And as The Logic reported in July 2019, foreign tech giants more than tripled their government relations activity in Ottawa under the Liberals. Google, Facebook and Twitter sought discussions on topics like NAFTA's intellectual property and digital trade measures and the laws governing online political ads.</p><p>They'll be no less busy in 2020. The Liberals are promising major Big Tech regulations, including rules to \"better protect people's personal data and to encourage greater competition in the digital marketplace,\" overseen by a new data commissioner.</p><p>Atop the agenda are new penalties for social media platforms that fail to \"remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours\" - a provision that's likely to apply to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google's YouTube.</p><p>Last summer, all three companies told the House justice committee they wanted to co-operate with the government to stop the spread of hateful and extremist messages online. But McKay called for more international co-ordination, claiming it's difficult to follow individual rules in different countries; Chan said setting specific takedown timelines risks turning the platforms into censors; and Austin called for clear transparency standards against which platforms can be measured.</p><p>Big Tech also faces bigger tax bills from Ottawa. The Liberals have promised a three-per-cent value-added tax on Canadian sales of online ads and user data for businesses with domestic revenues of $40 million or more, and at least $1 billion globally. It's scheduled to take effect in April 2020. U.S. tech industry groups including the Internet Association - of which Twitter, Facebook and Google are members - have called on the Trump administration to pressure Ottawa to drop it. In November 2019, all three firms updated their lobbying registration to include the measure; both Twitter and Google have already met with senior Finance Canada officials responsible for tax policy.</p><p>? Steven Guilbeault: Minister of Canadian Heritage The rookie MP shares responsibility with Bains for many of the most important innovation files. Top of their joint to-do list is deciding which suggestions to take from the government-appointed panel reviewing the federal broadcasting and telecommunications laws, which will deliver its conclusions by the end of the month.</p><p>Guilbeault will be expected to deliver early symbolic wins as part of the Liberals'beefed-up stance on Big Tech. He's responsible for the social media takedown regulations, and has until the end of this year to introduce legislation requiring online content platforms to host and pay to create \"meaningful levels\" of Canadian material.</p><p>The heritage minister and his counterparts at Innovation and Justice are also working on new online rights for consumers, including data portability and the right to withdraw their personal information from tech firms.</p><p>Before running for the Liberals in Montreal in the October 2019 election, Guilbeault was best-known as an environmental activist, and he spent part of the new Parliament's first two sitting weeks deflecting reporters'questions about climate change and energy legislation to other cabinet members. As the government focuses on clean technology and greening the economy, he could play a role as a member of the economy and environment cabinet committee.</p><p>? Joyce Murray: Minister of Digital Government Murray will be the first full-time cabinet member for the federal technology infrastructure. She's tasked with overseeing the \"transition to a more digital government in order to improve citizen service.\"</p><p>Government departments are testing artificial intelligence and blockchain for tasks like tracking regulations and identity verification, while teams like the Canadian Digital Service work to replace paper-based processes, like rescheduling a citizenship test, with online ones. The government has also established new guidelines for its technology use, launching a risk-assessment tool for automated decision-making and a data strategy.</p><p>Murray has been put in charge of Shared Services Canada, Ottawa's IT department, and is also tasked with preventing repeats of high-profile technology project failures, such as that of the Phoenix payroll system, which caused significant HR and budgetary problems, or the rollout of the unified canada.ca email service, which was downsized after falling more than a year behind schedule. She's responsible for the in-progress search for a Phoenix replacement, and setting up a new \"centre of expertise\" that will advise on buying and installing big new technology systems.</p><p>? Mona Nemer: Chief Science Adviser ? Will Amos: Parliamentary Secretary for Science to the Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Industry Science had its own dedicated minister in the last Parliament; this time around, the Liberals have rolled it into Bains's portfolio. But the breadth of the innovation minister's responsibilities could mean bigger supporting roles for Nemer and Amos.</p><p>Bains's mandate letter tasks him and the chief science adviser with making the government's research publicly available, and pushing for scientific analysis to factor into decision-making.</p><p>Unmentioned were several big files left on former science minister Kirsty Duncan's desk, including a $2.8-billion program for federal laboratories announced in the 2018 budget, and a plan to replace piecemeal funding for third-party science organizations with a new Strategic Science Fund, revealed in the 2019 edition.</p><p>Science advocates are also pushing the government to finish implementing the recommendations of a 2017 review led by David Naylor, former president of the University of Toronto. While Ottawa increased funding to the three federal councils that award research grants and to graduate scholarship programs over the last two budgets, it provided less than two-thirds of the recommended money. It has not adopted other recommendations, like a parliamentary committee on research facilities.</p><p>One the Liberals did implement was the appointment of a chief science adviser. Nemer, a medical researcher who's served as vice-president of research at the University of Ottawa, was named to the post in September 2017. She's provided input on the federal labs program from the 2018 budget and is working to set up positions like her own within federal departments and agencies.</p><p>? Matthew Boswell: Commissioner of Competition Boswell has steered the agency in a tech-focused direction since his March appointment, prioritizing the digital economy, telecommunications and biosciences sectors and picking \"high-impact and consumer-focused\" cases in a bid to ensure competition and innovation in the market.</p><p>His competition bureau has already forced its first divestment, when U.S. private equity firm Thoma Bravo agreed to sell one of its two portfolio companies making reporting and valuation software for oil and gas software firms in August 2019. It has also sealed an interim agreement with Montreal-based FlightHub as part of a hidden-fees investigation and warned nearly 100 companies to review their influencer campaigns to ensure they're following the law on paid promotions.</p><p>In May, Bains asked Boswell to review Canada's competition and enforcement practices to ensure they account for technology-driven issues like digital transformation and data accumulation and control.</p><p>? Robert Ghiz: CEO, Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association The Liberals made cellphone bill reductions one of the key pocketbook issues in their re-election campaign. While the government is hoping telecoms will make the 25-per-cent cuts on their own, they've paired their call for co-operation with the threat of increased competition via MVNOs.</p><p>But the industry hasn't embraced the target, nor does it seem eager to accept the alternative.</p><p>The Big Three telecom firms - Rogers, BCE Inc.'s Bell and Telus - have previously opposed proposals to require them to sell network access to challenger carriers at set prices, arguing that such rules would reduce the incentive to build wireless infrastructure. They've also argued that Canada is already a competitive market.</p><p>The incumbents are reportedly preparing a lobbying push against the Liberals' plans. They're well represented in Ottawa: the Big Three between them have at least a dozen staff who spend a fifth or more of their time lobbying, and have at least as many outside government relations consultants registered to lobby on their behalf.</p><p>But as the wireless industry's chief lobbyist, Ghiz, a former Liberal staffer and P.E.I. premier, has taken the lead in responding to the government proposals.</p><p>For more news about the innovation economy visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thelogic.co\">www.thelogic.co</url> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Along with Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, who will remain the key government player on much of the file, here are the cabinet members, public servants and private-sector players most likely to have an impact on federal business and technology policy. Simon Kennedy: Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Economic Development Canada (ISED) The department's public-service head took over in September, after four years leading Health Canada. He was deputy minister for international trade during the closing stages of Canada's treaties with the European Union and South Korea. Such markets are key to the Liberal government's $1.1-billion plan to diversify the countries to which Canadian firms sell and increase exports by 50 per cent by 2025.

That gives opposition critics Rempel Garner and Masse considerable power to amend legislation or push investigations via the industry, science and technology committee.</p><p>Calgary MP Rempel Garner has wasted little time stepping into her new critic portfolio, claiming the government hasn't made any meaningful changes to privacy and data rules and asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to lay out his plan for mobile virtual network operators - a type of challenger wireless carrier that Bains has been tasked with helping expand in Canada. During the Conservatives'last stint in government she led Western Economic Diversification Canada, one of the federal government's six regional development agencies, and previously ran a research and technology commercialization program at the University of Calgary.</p><p>Masse returns as the NDP's innovation critic, and has called for more details on the government's digital charter, a set of 10 high-level principles announced in May 2019. The Windsor, Ont., MP will have a special focus on telecommunications policy; NDP leader Jagmeet Singh named reducing cellphone bills as one of his six priorities for this parliament. Colin McKay: head of public policy &amp;; government relations, Google Canada Kevin Chan: head of public policy, Facebook Canada Michele Austin: head of government &amp;; public policy, Twitter Canada All three of these Big Tech lobbyists are experienced Ottawa insiders. McKay, the longest-tenured, moved to Google in 2011 from an executive role in the federal privacy commissioner's office. Chan started at Facebook in 2014; he was a senior policy adviser to then-Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff between 2009 and 2011 after a stint as an aide to the Clerk of the Privy Council. Austin, a former chief of staff to Conservative ministers Rona Ambrose and Maxime Bernier, joined Twitter in April 2018 from government relations firm Summa Strategies.</p><p>The trio have been frequent visitors to Parliament Hill, testifying at parliamentary committees'hearings on online hate, privacy breaches and copyright rules. And as The Logic reported in July 2019, foreign tech giants more than tripled their government relations activity in Ottawa under the Liberals. Google, Facebook and Twitter sought discussions on topics like NAFTA's intellectual property and digital trade measures and the laws governing online political ads.</p><p>They'll be no less busy in 2020.</p><p>The Liberals are promising major Big Tech regulations, including rules to \"better protect people's personal data and to encourage greater competition in the digital marketplace,\" overseen by a new data commissioner. Atop the agenda are new penalties for social media platforms that fail to \"remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours\" - a provision that's likely to apply to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google's YouTube.</p><p>Last summer, all three companies told the House justice committee they wanted to co-operate with the government to stop the spread of hateful and extremist messages online. But McKay called for more international co-ordination, claiming it's difficult to follow individual rules in different countries; Chan said setting specific takedown timelines risks turning the platforms into censors; and Austin called for clear transparency standards against which platforms can be measured.</p><p>Big Tech also faces bigger tax bills from Ottawa. The Liberals have promised a three-per-cent value-added tax on Canadian sales of online ads and user data for businesses with domestic revenues of $40 million or more, and at least $1 billion globally. It's scheduled to take effect in April 2020. U.S. tech industry groups including the Internet Association - of which Twitter, Facebook and Google are members - have called on the Trump administration to pressure Ottawa to drop it.</p><p>In November 2019, all three firms updated their lobbying registration to include the measure; both Twitter and Google have already met with senior Finance Canada officials responsible for tax policy. Steven Guilbeault: Minister of Canadian Heritage The rookie MP shares responsibility with Bains for many of the most important innovation files. Top of their joint to-do list is deciding which suggestions to take from the government-appointed panel reviewing the federal broadcasting and telecommunications laws, which will deliver its conclusions by the end of the month.</p><p>Guilbeault will be expected to deliver early symbolic wins as part of the Liberals'beefed-up stance on Big Tech. He's responsible for the social media takedown regulations, and has until the end of this year to introduce legislation requiring online content platforms to host and pay to create \"meaningful levels\" of Canadian material.</p><p>The heritage minister and his counterparts at Innovation and Justice are also working on new online rights for consumers, including data portability and the right to withdraw their personal information from tech firms.</p><p>Before running for the Liberals in Montreal in the October 2019 election, Guilbeault was bestknown as an environmental activist, and he spent part of the new Parliament's first two sitting weeks deflecting reporters'questions about climate change and energy legislation to other cabinet members. As the government focuses on clean technology and greening the economy, he could play a role as a member of the economy and environment cabinet committee. Joyce Murray: Minister of Digital Government Murray will be the first full-time cabinet member for the federal technology infrastructure. She's tasked with overseeing the \"transition to a more digital government in order to improve citizen service.\"</p><p>Government departments are testing artificial intelligence and blockchain for tasks like tracking regulations and identity verification, while teams like the Canadian Digital Service work to replace paper-based processes, like rescheduling a citizenship test, with online ones. The government has also established new guidelines for its technology use, launching a risk-assessment tool for automated decision-making and a data strategy.</p><p>Murray has been put in charge of Shared Services Canada, Ottawa's IT department, and is also tasked with preventing repeats of high-profile technology project failures, such as that of the Phoenix payroll system, which caused significant HR and budgetary problems, or the rollout of the unified canada.ca email service, which was downsized after falling more than a year behind schedule. She's responsible for the in-progress search for a Phoenix replacement, and setting up a new \"centre of expertise\" that will advise on buying and installing big new technology systems. Mona Nemer: Chief Science Adviser Will Amos: Parliamentary Secretary for Science to the Minister of Innovation, Science &amp;; Industry Science had its own dedicated minister in the last Parliament; this time around, the Liberals have rolled it into Bains's portfolio. But the breadth of the innovation minister's responsibilities could mean bigger supporting roles for Nemer and Amos.</p><p>Bains's mandate letter tasks him and the chief science adviser with making the government's research publicly available, and pushing for scientific analysis to factor into decision-making.</p><p>Unmentioned were several big files left on former science minister Kirsty Duncan's desk, including a $2.8-billion program for federal laboratories announced in the 2018 budget, and a plan to replace piecemeal funding for third-party science organizations with a new Strategic Science Fund, revealed in the 2019 edition.</p><p>Science advocates are also pushing the government to finish implementing the recommendations of a 2017 review led by David Naylor, former president of the University of Toronto. While Ottawa increased funding to the three federal councils that award research grants and to graduate scholarship programs over the last two budgets, it provided less than two-thirds of the recommended money. It has not adopted other recommendations, like a parliamentary committee on research facilities.</p><p>One the Liberals did implement was the appointment of a chief science adviser. Nemer, a medical researcher who's served as vice-president of research at the University of Ottawa, was named to the post in September 2017. She's provided input on the federal labs program from the 2018 budget and is working to set up positions like her own within federal departments and agencies. Matthew Boswell: Commissioner of Competition Boswell has steered the agency in a tech-focused direction since his March appointment, prioritizing the digital economy, telecommunications and biosciences sectors and picking \"high-impact and consumer-focused\" cases in a bid to ensure competition and innovation in the market.</p><p>His competition bureau has already forced its first divestment, when U.S. private equity firm Thoma Bravo agreed to sell one of its two portfolio companies making reporting and valuation software for oil and gas software firms in August 2019. It has also sealed an interim agreement with Montreal-based FlightHub as part of a hidden-fees investigation and warned nearly 100 companies to review their influencer campaigns to ensure they're following the law on paid promotions.</p><p>In May, Bains asked Boswell to review Canada's competition and enforcement practices to ensure they account for technology-driven issues like digital transformation and data accumulation and control. Robert Ghiz: CEO, Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association The Liberals made cellphone bill reductions one of the key pocketbook issues in their re-election campaign. While the government is hoping telecoms will make the 25-per-cent cuts on their own, they've paired their call for co-operation with the threat of increased competition via MVNOs.</p><p>But the industry hasn't embraced the target, nor does it seem eager to accept the alternative.</p><p>The Big Three telecom firms - Rogers, BCE Inc.'s Bell and Telus - have previously opposed proposals to require them to sell network access to challenger carriers at set prices, arguing that such rules would reduce the incentive to build wireless infrastructure. They've also argued that Canada is already a competitive market.</p><p>The incumbents are reportedly preparing a lobbying push against the Liberals' plans. They're well represented in Ottawa: the Big Three between them have at least a dozen staff who spend a fifth or more of their time lobbying, and have at least as many outside government relations consultants registered to lobby on their behalf.</p><p>But as the wireless industry's chief lobbyist, Ghiz, a former Liberal staffer and P.E.I. premier, has taken the lead in responding to the government proposals.
