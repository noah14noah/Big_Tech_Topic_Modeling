We're watching the widening fallout from sexual misconduct accusations and V.C.s spending less money in trying to find the next Uber. More on those in a minute. (And congrats to the Houston Astros for finally winning the World Series.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tell us what you think: We've put together a survey about the economy, business and public policy with our friends at Morning Consult. Take it here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A reminder: DealBook's sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here.</p><p>  Who's going to pay for tax cuts?</p><p>  Today, we're supposed to finally see House Republicans' vision of what a tax code change would look like (even if it is unlikely to bear the name President Trump is said to prefer, the ''Cut Cut Cut Act''). The bill will include a permanent cut of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and a phased-in repeal of the estate tax, according to Axios.</p><p>  But the question of how the bill would be financed remains unanswered. ''Some industry groups familiar with the negotiations said the remaining shortfall was in the hundreds of billions of dollars,'' according to The NYT.</p><p>  Among the groups that are expected to pay more, according to Politico: private colleges, charities, companies that provide meals to employees and insurers.</p><p>  The rollout: Gary Cohn will deliver a midday speech to the Economic Club of Washington, while <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>will speak at the International Franchise Association conference in Los Angeles.</p><p>  Potential stumbling blocks</p><p>  A big one, according to Axios, is the treatment of pass-through businesses, which include partnerships like real estate trusts as well as small businesses:</p><p>  Some influential Republican House members are saying final language on the tax bill's treatment of those situations will disadvantage some small firms and could imperil G.O.P. support for the plan. ''This is supposed to be a simplification. It's not,'' a House G.O.P. member told me. ''It's going to be the most explosive thing once members hear about it.''</p><p><person><nameText>Representative Tom MacArthur </nameText></person>of New Jersey and other Republicans from high-tax states are still pressing to maintain healthy deductions for state and local taxes, according to The NYT.</p><p>  Homebuilders have already signaled that they will oppose the bill because it would effectively reduce the home mortgage interest deduction.</p><p>  And <person><nameText>Representative </nameText></person>Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, has unfavorably compared the secretive talks over the tax bill to the efforts to overhaul health care, according to Politico:</p><p>  ''Anything that gets done in a cloak of secrecy is certainly not what an open and deliberative body should do.''</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   The bill ''is a tacit admission of something the rest of the world has already concluded: It's better to tax people than capital,'' writes Greg Ip of The WSJ.</p><p>  Elsewhere in Washington</p><p>   The president has revived a feud with a fellow native New Yorker, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, in the wake of the terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan that killed eight people. (Politico)</p><p>Apple, IBM and Google were among the tech companies that signed a legal brief challenging the White House's efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program. (Axios)</p><p>  Are tech giants stepping up their response to public criticism?</p><p>  If lawmakers' questions for the top lawyers at Facebook, Google and Twitter on Wednesday were a clue, tech giants will continue to face heightened scrutiny from Washington and beyond.</p><p>   Senator Dianne Feinstein of California: ''I must say, I don't think you get it.''</p><p>   Senator Angus King of Maine: ''I'm disappointed that you're here, and not your C.E.O.s.''</p><p>  Revelations about tech companies' actions before the 2016 elections don't help those companies' cause. Lawmakers made public some of the political ads that Russian entities bought on social media. Twitter offered 15 percent of its election-related ad inventory to the Russian television network RT, according to BuzzFeed.</p><p>  And Britain's elections watchdog has begun an inquiry into whether Russia used social media to interfere with last year's ''Brexit'' referendum, according to The Times of London.</p><p>  Tech companies' response to the interference -- and the power their size affords them in general -- weighed heavily on lawmakers' minds.</p><p>  But there are signs that tech titans are recognizing that they must do more to appease Congress and the public. During a call to discuss Facebook's latest blockbuster quarterly earnings, Mark Zuckerberg said:</p><p>  ''I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward. And I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me. I believe this will make our society stronger and, in doing so, will be good for all of us over the long term.''</p><p>  And Tim Cook of Apple told NBC News:</p><p>  ''I think they learned along the way a lot. And, you know, I think it's best to ask them if they projected it or not. I don't believe that the big issue are ads from foreign government. I believe that's, like, 0.1 percent of the issue. The bigger issue is that some of these tools are used to divide people, to manipulate people.''</p><p>  How Farhad Manjoo learned to stop worrying and love big tech</p><p>  He asks in his latest NYT column: ''The tech giants are too big. But what if that's not so bad?''</p><p>  'He's boring, but he's to the point.'</p><p>  That's what the Jeffries chief economist Ward McCarthy wrote of Jerome Powell, above, whose nomination as the next Federal Reserve chairman is expected to be announced at 3 p.m. today.</p><p>  What do other economists think of a Powell Fed?</p><p>   ''He represents a bit of the continuation of the status quo without being named Yellen,'' said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities. (Bloomberg)</p><p>   ''You get, broadly speaking, continuity of Yellen's careful and relatively dovish approach to monetary policy, but with somebody who is a card-carrying Republican,'' said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI and a former New York Fed official. (WSJ)</p><p>  More macroeconomic news</p><p>   The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged but suggested that a rate increase would be coming next month. (NYT)</p><p>   The Bank of England is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than a decade. (WSJ)</p><p>   The rise and fall of Gary Cohn, also-ran for the Fed chairmanship. (Politico)</p><p>  The fallout from sexual misconduct accusations widens.</p><p>  And it has spread well beyond Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>   Warner Brothers severed ties with the producer and director Brett Rattner after The L.A. Times spoke with six women who accused him of harassment and assault.</p><p>   In Britain, Defense Minister Michael Fallon resigned over allegations about his past conduct, amid a growing outcry over claims of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior by politicians. (NYT)</p><p>Netflix and Media Rights Capital halted work on the sixth and final season of ''House of Cards'' after an actor said that Kevin Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance on him when he was a 14-year-old in the 1980s. Mr. Spacey is now seeking ''evaluation and treatment.'' (People)</p><p>   Michael Oreskes, the head of NPR's news division and a former editor at The NYT, stepped down after being accused of sexually harassing women. (NPR)</p><p>   A woman who has accused Mr. Trump of unwanted sexual advances is pressing forward with a defamation lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court. (NYT)</p><p>  The accusations have prompted anxiety among men and companies. From The Hollywood Reporter:</p><p>  ''We all wake up now thinking, 'What's next? Who's next?''' says one network public relations chief.</p><p>  Investors are spending less time hunting the next Uber.</p><p>  But venture capital firms are putting more money into the deals they make.</p><p>  Here's what's happening, courtesy of data that Thomson Reuters gave to us first: American V.C. firms invested $17.6 billion in 950 transactions during the third quarter of this year. That is a 5 percent increase in dollars invested but a 7 percent drop in the number of deals -- and in fact is the lowest number of deals in a quarter since the beginning of 2012. But it was also the strongest quarter for venture dollars invested since the second quarter of 2015.</p><p>  What that means: V.C.s are being more conservative about new ventures, even as they invest more. (Thomson Reuters also found that American V.C.s raised $4.4 billion during the quarter, setting a four-year low for fund-raising in a quarter.)</p><p>  A bit of Silicon Valley humor</p><p>  ''When in San Francisco, I visit the Valley to watch unicorns prance with angels. They talk merrily about rounds and rounds of seeds.'' (New Yorker)</p><p>  Meet Goldman Sachs, purveyor of dad jokes.</p><p>  From an event that Goldman hosted for its personal lending arm, Marcus, according to Olivia Oran of Reuters:</p><p>  The Speed Read</p><p>  M. &amp; A.</p><p>   Permira said it would buy the corporate finance adviser Duff &amp; Phelps for $1.75 billion from a group that includes Carlyle. (WSJ)</p><p>Qualcomm said its $38 billion buyout of NXP could take until early next year to complete, after European antitrust regulators extended their review of the deal. (FT)</p><p>Hudson's Bay Company said it had received an unsolicited offer from Signa Holding, an Austrian investment company, for its German department store chain, Galeria Kaufhof, but that the $3.5 billion bid was incomplete and lacked financing. (WSJ)</p><p>  Policy and Legal</p><p>   Muddy Waters Capital has filed a petition in New York State Supreme Court seeking to make Google identify the people behind two email addresses. It says they were used deceptively to solicit information about one of its investment campaigns. (FT)</p><p>   Celebrities who promote coin offerings may be violating several laws, including antifraud regulations and rules that govern investment brokers, the S.E.C. said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. (NYT)</p><p>   WPP has started proceedings in Japan against its long-term partner there, Asatsu DK. They clashed after Bain Capital made a bid for the Japanese company. (FT)</p><p>   Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack, had passed a background check and driven more then 1,400 times for Uber in the past six months, a reflection of how difficult it is to screen for potentially criminal behavior. (USA Today)</p><p>  Banks and Banking</p><p>Credit Suisse hasn't been immune to the trading slump, but Tidjane Thiam's pivot to wealth management has propelled assets under management to a record level. (Bloomberg)</p><p>  Private Capital (P.E. and V.C.)</p><p>   Price is still a stumbling block for SoftBank's proposed Uber investment -- shareholders are insisting on a valuation greater than the $50 billion under discussion, according to people with knowledge of the process. (Recode)</p><p>  Money Managers</p><p>   A series of deals by top executives at Guggenheim Partners has set off concerns over possible favoritism and self-dealing from its internal compliance, auditing and investment teams. (FT)</p><p>  Business and Economy</p><p>   Some analysts worry that the iPhone X, which starts at $1,000, could stunt holiday spending for sellers of clothing and other items. (WSJ)</p><p>Tesla is hamstrung on the most basic part of the car business, getting vehicles built on time, and Elon Musk has been trying to calm investors. (NYT)</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway's insurance subsidiaries have yielded billions of investment dollars for Warren Buffett. That may change in the third quarter after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. (Bloomberg)</p><p>   Sales of Papa John's pizza have suffered because of national anthem protests in the National Football League, the company's founder said. (Sports Illustrated)</p><p>   Emmanuel Macron is going after France's wealth tax, which has been sacrosanct since it was created in 1982, leading to accusations that he is the ''president of the rich.''

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses.</p><p>In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt - plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, the Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. The article notes that \"iPhones are designed by Apple in California, but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley?! Check out the Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 25 are based in the United States - 23 of them in California. Of the three not located in California, two are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.Two years ago, the Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco - and its environs - a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p>Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p>To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p>Creators Syndicate</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-165994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BMG-GK11-DY37-D198-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 12, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKI</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLIMATE &amp;

It is now getting to the crunch point</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And you can see why.  Finance ministers see spectacularly profitable international behemoths making billions from their citizens while paying taxes more akin to a smallish domestic company. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EU estimates that digital businesses pay on average 9.5 per cent corporation tax, compared to an average of 23 per cent for traditional businesses. </p><p>Of course the politicians have themselves to blame. Finance ministries around the world have allowed their tax codes to become overlong, bafflingly complex and nationalistic. </p><p>                      Big tech is so vast, so fast growing, profitable and visible with all those consumer brands, that governments are sure to start ringing the changes                    </p><p>Tax convergence across the finance departments of different states is rarer than a budget surplus.</p><p>This opens the door to some top class, but broadly legal, tax manipulation in the shape of pricing of products or services across territories.</p><p>We have always had a fair amount of this from major industrial and energy businesses. </p><p>But big tech is so vast, so fast growing, profitable and visible with all those consumer brands, that governments are sure to start ringing the changes.</p><p>So how is this tax manipulation done and what can governments do to counter it?</p><p>                     Transfer pricing                   </p><p>Transfer pricing is the main culprit. </p><p>It allows a company's finance director to maintain low levels of taxation regardless of how much profit is being made.</p><p>Since (for now) revenues are not taxed but profits are, the price of inputs is arranged so that most of the profit is booked in the lowest tax area in which that company operates. </p><p>You order a book on Amazon.co.uk.  It is sourced in the UK, is despatched from Amazon's UK warehouse and delivered to you in the UK.  But the invoice is from Amazon in the Netherlands. Easy. </p><p>Big tech operates across most of the developed world so that leaves plenty of flexibility, especially as most of the value of these companies is in their intellectual property, not factories, offices and other hard assets. </p><p>The ownership of this intellectual property can be shifted to a subsidiary in a low-tax country, which then invoices operations in higher-tax ones for the use of that know-how, transferring profits from higher-tax to lower-tax regimes.</p><p>This is only possible because tax authorities fail to enforce the requirement for companies to adequately justify the transfer pricing they are using: how can intellectual property actually reside in Ireland when there is no material headcount there either creating or maintaining it? </p><p>If Google employs thousands of highly-paid engineers in California and none in Ireland, then it should be impossible to argue that its intellectual property, its most vital asset, exists in Ireland and not in the US. </p><p>The US (and other governments) are failing to use their power to look through clearly fictitious transfer-pricing and tax the underlying reality of the business.</p><p>The alternative would be to get the companies to correct their transfer-pricing voluntarily, and the French may be showing us half the solution: tax revenue instead, as it is much harder to move. </p><p>If a French advert is shown to a French consumer in France, it is hard to argue that the resulting revenue was generated in Ireland, simply so that a very low Irish tax rate can be applied to that transaction.</p><p>The EU has been arguing about what to do for months. </p><p>France has lost patience and is proposing a 3 per cent revenue tax on digital companies providing a service in France. </p><p>The UK plans to introduce something similar next April. Neither will be easy. </p><p>The US sees this as an unfair burden on the largely US digital sector and has said it will retaliate so expect cheese, wine and Airbus planes to be more expensive when you next visit the US. </p><p>The ideal would have been for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) and the G20 to implement an international agreement for digital tax policies that combat the issue of tax avoidance. </p><p>But the fact that two of Europe's biggest economies have decided to take matters into their own hands shows the scale of political frustration with the status quo.</p><p>However, this is only half of the solution: the revenue tax model could be made more sophisticated. </p><p>                     How to tax                   </p><p>Revenue tax should only apply if the proportion of a company's global taxable profits asserted to be earned in France is wildly different to the proportion of global revenue generated there. </p><p>So if France accounts for 5 per cent of Google's global revenue but less than 1 per cent of taxable profits, the sales tax applies.</p><p>If 2 per cent of profit was deemed to come from France, that might be seen as acceptable and no revenue tax would apply. </p><p>I suspect this would see a rapid correction in transfer pricing, as otherwise companies are going to find themselves taxed twice.</p><p>Some argue that France (or the UK) cannot afford to lose the internet giants. </p><p>That is wrong. These are not truly global companies: they are US companies that have succeeded in Europe, have failed in China and are trying to develop a business in India. </p><p>Everything else is too small to be relevant. They will not withdraw from such lucrative markets as France, Germany or the UK, as they would see sudden absolute declines in revenue and global profits - their shares would collapse. </p><p>The bald fact is that these companies feel obliged to play the game of tax avoidance because some of their shareholders demand it. </p><p>The tax authorities have been inert in standing up for those rules. </p><p>If the rules are now tightened up, Google, Facebook, Amazon et al will abide by them. </p><p>They may even be relieved to do so - international tax planning is time-consuming, expensive and distorts business decisions. </p><p>No one enjoys it.  Straighten out the tax incentives and let everyone get on with managing their businesses.</p><p>By the way, this would increase tax take for the US as well - that is where the intellectual property truly resides, so that is where the benefits would end up being taxed.

G20 finance ministers and central bank governors will hear about the plan in Washington next week, with\u00a0agreement in principle from the G20 sought by the end of January so that the OECD\u00a0can work up detailed rules.</p><p>This could end the\u00a0practice of shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions and leaving little corporate tax revenue for large economies to collect, despite substantial sales in their countries.</p><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0Margrethe Vestager, who has been in confirmation hearings for her new five-year term as the EU's competition commissioner, has warned she will be much more vigilant regarding Big Tech's practices, and more effective remedies would be sought along with fines to ensure competition in markets.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

Players seem to prefer trying their luck this way rather than making direct purchases of better equipment or new characters.

This legislation, H.B. 1144, bars individual cities from enforcing their own standards on companies like Lyft or Uber.</p><p>Robert Bishoff, sole owner and driver of Ride of Your Life taxi service in Dickinson, agrees with Dill and believes that the higher insurance premiums he has to pay is making him struggle to compete.</p><p>\"The city of Dickinson has demanded a one million dollar insurance policy and the state of North Dakota has decided that a half million dollar policy is adequate for Lyft,\" Bishoff said. \"Business is more difficult, we'll be lucky to survive.\"</p><p>City Administrator Shawn Kessel said that the million-dollar insurance policy and other local taxi regulations came together a few years ago when the city needed to update a fairly \"simplistic\" previous ordinance that didn't cover basic regulations such as licensing drivers.</p><p>In addition to raising the insurance policy minimum to one million dollars, the taxi ordinance enforced standards such as requiring city registration, background checks, chauffeur licensing, visible rate meters, company name labelling and others.</p><p>\"What's happened since then of course is the explosion in transportation network companies like Lyft and Uber,\" Kessel said. \"The state took authority (to regulate ride-sharing apps) away from municipalities ... I'm hoping that a similar level of due diligence is being conducted at a state-level.\"</p><p>Kessel said that it would be possible for the city to reexamine the taxi ordinance, and possibly reduce the insurance premium, but the city would have to evaluate whether this would be in the best interests of the community and public safety.</p><p>Dill said that he hopes that safety issues will be better addressed in the future by Uber and Lyft.</p><p>\"For safety purposes, we have to have some way of identifying the vehicles and the drivers,\" Dill said.</p><p>Lyft drivers are required by state law to undergo background checks, but they do not need to identify their vehicles in the same manner as local cab companies.</p><p>Dickinson resident David Greenwood was one of the first drivers for Lyft in the city and said that there are now about 25 drivers in the city, 12-15 consistently, and many more riders than when he first started.</p><p>\"It's been booming, we've been growing day by day for sure,\" Greenwood said. \"Lyft already can sustain and be very good for this community, it's already shown how much it's grown in just two months that it's going to be just fine in my opinion.\"</p><p>Greenwood said that while he understands the concerns that Lyft may be displacing local taxi companies, he believes their entrance into Dickinson was inevitable.</p><p>\"Regardless, if I was driving or not, Lyft was going to make it to our community,\" Greenwood said. \"I hope there is work for all of us and I don't want anybody to go out of business because of it. At the end of the day, Lyft is here and I have the opportunity to take that.\"</p><p>In an interview in September, Rep. George Keiser, R-District 47, (a primary sponsor on the ride-sharing regulation law) said that he was against barring cities from enforcing local standards in the first place and is open to tweaking it in the next legislature.</p><p>Lawmakers have also discussed requiring stricter standards for ride-sharing vehicles to report accidents to state authorities.</p><p>While Sen. Rich Wardner, R-District 37, said that he didn't work on the initial piece of legislation for ride-sharing regulation, he is open to revisiting it in the next legislature.</p><p>\"If there needs to be some changes to make it a level playing field, I'm more than open to that,\" Wardner said.</p><p>Bishoff said that while he hopes he can continue driving in Dickinson, he's not sure how much longer he'll be able to maintain his business under current conditions.</p><p>\"I do love my job, honestly,\" Bishoff said. \"It's joyful to get young people to work so they can survive and thrive and pay their bills, and Dickinson's a beautiful clean safe city, a wonderful town to work in.\"</p><p>___ (c)2017 the Dickinson Press (Dickinson, N.D.)

AOI, Ireland, incidentally, is the parent company for Apple India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple India itself paid tax of Rs 156 crore to the Indian government in 2011-12, and of the three tech companies\u2019 Indian operations ET Magazine looked at for this story \u2014 Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014 it was the one with the least amount of taxes under disputes; only minor amounts in relation to its overall profits for 2011-12 are disputed or demanded by tax authorities.</p><p>At the other extreme is Microsoft, which faces over Rs 2,000 crore in tax demands (both service and income tax) across its group companies which operate in India. And Google\u2019s India arm is locked in a dispute with the authorities over Rs 156 crore of tax demands in relation to its 2008 balance sheet.</p><p>In its financial statements, Google says that if the government assesses its income in later years in a similar fashion to the company\u2019s 2008 income, its tax \u2018impact\u2019 could rise to Rs 480 crore.</p><p>Apart from these three, a whole range of other tech companies in India have received tax notices, Nokia (about Rs 2,000 crore), and IBM India (Rs 1,090 crore) being the more prominent ones. But it\u2019s Apple, Google and Microsoft that have faced international scrutiny for their tax practices. Let\u2019s look at their run-ins with the Indian taxman.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Family Relationships</p><p>The subsidiaries of all three companies in India perform a whole range of functions \u2014 from research to customer support to actively marketing to local consumers. As Vikram Doshi, partner, tax and regulatory services at KPMG, points out, tech companies fall along a broad spectrum. At one extreme are those whose operations in India are solely focused on servicing group companies around the world.</p><p>\u201cAt the other extreme are companies focused on the potential of the domestic market and of targeting consumers here.\u201d In actual practice many companies do both and fall, therefore, somewhere in the middle.</p><p>And depending on the market they serve, whether foreign or domestic, and whether \u2018customers\u2019 are in-house \u2014 that is, other group companies \u2014 or people buying iPads, the tax implications vary. Take Microsoft for instance. It operates separate companies in India, each focused on a different line of business. Microsoft India handles marketing for the company\u2019s products, such as Office or Windows 8.</p><p>While it focuses on the domestic market, two sister companies (see Big Tech\u2019s India...) focus on servicing group companies. ET Magazine approached Microsoft with a list of questions but there was no response till the time of going to press. Given the range of activities of Microsoft\u2019s India operations, it\u2019s no surprise that the kind of tax notices and disputes it faces span a spectrum.</p><p>Take Microsoft India which provides marketing support services to the group\u2019s Singapore arm. It claimed that such services, aimed at drumming up customers in India, qualified as service exports and were therefore tax exempt. The taxman disagreed with the result that the company now faces a total of Rs 347 crore in service taxes due as of 2012. The dispute is in the courts. It\u2019s worth recognising an interesting fact about the ways the MNC tech companies in India earn their revenue.</p><p>Quite apart from support or R&amp;D services to overseas group companies (important for both Google and Microsoft), all three companies have a substantial base of domestic customers with whom they do business. Except for Apple, both Google and Microsoft however, record almost all their income as coming from overseas group companies (well over 80%), irrespective of whether they serve other group companies or sell to Indian customers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And while Apple books revenue in India from domestic customers, it buys over Rs 1,148 crore of goods from a fellow subsidiary in Ireland. Why would MNC tech companies in India structure their businesses in such a way as to treat even income from domestic consumers as income earned from overseas parents?</p><p>No Permanent Presence?</p><p>Google\u2019s tax issues with Indian authorities are about its Adwords advertising service under which a person can buy the right to have their ads displayed on Google when certain text is searched. A florist, for example, might buy the right to have his ads displayed whenever anyone searches for the words \u2018flowers\u2019 or \u2018birthday\u2019.</p><p>From the taxman\u2019s point of view though, here\u2019s what\u2019s important: one of Google India\u2019s roles is to pitch to customers the benefits of buying Adwords on Google \u2014 it\u2019s essentially a marketer and distributor for the Adwords program in India, even as the technology infrastructure that makes the Adwords programme possible was developed and is managed elsewhere.</p><p>When an Indian customer books an ad, Google Ireland charges Google India a \u2018distribution fee\u2019 for each ad sold to an Indian customer\u2014 such fees essentially reflect a cost of running and maintaining such infrastructure. And Google India meanwhile, calculates its revenues, net of such fees. Essentially the money goes on a round trip \u2014 from the Indian customer to Google Ireland, and then back to Google India, after netting out fees.</p><p>The sums involved are substantial. Google India \u2018paid\u2019 a distribution fee of Rs 570 crore to Google Ireland, and booked revenues of Rs 337 crore from its Irish sister company in 2011-12 (its unclear how much of this is from the Adwords program).</p><p>Indian tax authorities have taken issue with this, and argued, in effect that even that Rs 570 crore should show up in the books of the Indian company and be taxed. If the tax authorities prevail in their view, Google could be forced to stump up as much as Rs 480 crore in taxes and interest across various years.</p><p>Incidentally, as news reports and analyses have shown, Google routes 88% of its sales outside the US through its Irish subsidiary.</p><p>There\u2019s another twist to the tax complications with Adwords as well \u2014 and that\u2019s on the customer\u2019s side.</p><p>Tax authorities have claimed that when an Indian customer buys Adwords from Google Ireland, it is required by tax law to deduct tax at source before hand.</p><p>In April though, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Kolkata ruled that this wasn\u2019t required, since Google Ireland did not have a \u2018permanent establishment\u2019 in India, and under the terms of an India-Ireland tax treaty, no taxes needed to be withheld by the Indian customer.</p><p>ET Magazine approached Google with a set of queries. A spokesperson responded: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate.</p><p>The reality is that most governments use tax incentives to attract foreign investment that creates jobs and economic growth and, naturally, companies respond to those incentives.</p><p>It\u2019s one of the main reasons Google located our international HQ in Ireland. If politicians don\u2019t like those laws, they have the power to change them.</p><p>Overall, our effective global corporate tax rate in 2012 was almost 20%.\u201d Even if Google India did have to book all the Adwords revenue from Indian customers, there\u2019s still a problem.</p><p>Since the Google site, and the back-end infrastructure supporting it, was not developed by Google India, its undeniable that at least a part of Adwords revenue in India has to be paid to the entity in the Google corporate universe which did so (though that\u2019s unlikely to be Google Ireland).</p><p>\u201cThe question is: how much in compensation or fee needs to be remitted by Google India,\u201d asks an accountant with one of the Big Four audit firms.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Arms Length</p><p>Given that a huge chunk of earnings of MNC tech companies\u2019 India arms are actually revenues from group companies elsewhere, or payments to them, the issue of what accountants call \u2018transfer pricing\u2019 is almost bound to arise. The problem arises when two companies, both under effectively the same management, trade goods or services with each other or do any kind of deal.</p><p>The \u2018price\u2019 at which that deal happens is effectively not a market-determined one, because management can decide which company should \u2018profit\u2019 from the deal \u2014 and quite often the criterion is to allocate the profits to the company located in a country or region where taxes are lower. In this way, the company in the \u2018high\u2019 tax country (like India) would record a loss and hence pay no tax. \u201cWhen it comes to such intercompany transactions, almost the only issue of relevance is transfer pricing,\u201d points out Doshi.</p><p>\u201cTransfer pricing issues are now centre stage when it comes to taxation of such international transactions between two group companies,\u201d agrees Aseem Chawla, partner at MPC Legal. In 2012-13 according to reports, the Indian tax authorities made transfer pricing \u2018adjustments\u2019 to the tune of over Rs 70,000 crore, in 3,200 cases, up from Rs 44,500 crore in 1,343 cases a year earlier.</p><p>Such adjustments effectively involve tweaking the taxable income earned by an Indian company from an international deal to reflect what the department would consider a \u2018fair\u2019 price \u2014 this is often based on the principle that there should be arms length relationship between the two companies involved. In other words, what would the terms of the contract be if the two companies were unrelated to each other, and each was trying to get the best terms for itself?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this \u2018fair\u2019 price is often a point of contention and litigation. The bulk of Microsoft India\u2019s tax disputes is around the issue of transfer pricing \u2014 the amount in dispute is around Rs 1,683 crore in revenue booked by Microsoft India\u2019s R&amp;D arm from its US parent. The funds are routed through an Irish fellow subsidiary, which operates as a central financial hub for the tech giant.</p><p>And, interestingly, as a US Senate subcommittee investigation of both Apple and Microsoft showed, Irish subsidiaries hold significant rights to the companies\u2019 intellectual property. \u201cFor technology companies, Ireland has been an important jurisdiction in which to house intellectual property rights. The IP protection regime is strong, and in addition, the tax rate is low, making it an ideal location,\u201d says Doshi.</p><p>Only the Beginning?</p><p>Indeed intellectual property, and how a customer at the retail end pays for it, and who they pay, is the other twist in this tale. A few years ago, Microsoft became the centre of a major tax case, which eventually led to critical changes in law, with retrospective effect. When we buy software such as Windows 8, are we buying a good (like a CD), or are we simply acquiring a licence to use that software, albeit indefinitely? Despite the fact that software buyers sign a licence agreement with Microsoft, when they buy software, thus implying that the company itself thinks of the deal as a licencing agreement, the company actually argued before the taxman in a different way. It claimed that buyers were being sold a copyrighted article, not acquiring a licence.</p><p>That licencing actually happened offshore, between various Microsoft entities, in a complicated series of deals. Customers bought the software in India from distributors (not Microsoft itself ), who in turn imported the software from Microsoft Singapore. The key here is how these two different types of revenue are taxed. If a customer is merely buying a good, earnings from it are taxed only if the seller has a presence in India.</p><p>If, instead, what we pay is royalty for acquiring a licence to use a copyrighted software, then any payments by Indian customers can be taxed in India before the funds are remitted overseas. Since Indian customers were buying the software not from Microsoft directly, but from its distributors in the country, and since Microsoft USA or Microsoft Singapore does not have a presence in India, there was no question of taxing Microsoft. On the other hand, if the customer was paying a royalty, then tax was implied even if the seller had no physical presence in the country.</p><p>The taxman disagreed with this reasoning and so did the Indian government which closed off this avenue of argument by amending the Income Tax Act last year, with retrospective effect. Of all three companies, it is Apple that has the least tax disputes. But that may well not last. Apple\u2019s revenue was Rs 2,003 crore in 2011-12 up sharply from Rs 620 crore in 2010-11. It\u2019s likely to have gone up even further in 2012-13. All this makes it a tempting target for tax authorities hungry for revenue.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-20719576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58R6-CBX1-DXJR-H32W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2138\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

And Google\u2019s India arm is locked in a dispute with the authorities over Rs 156 crore of tax demands in relation to its 2008 balance sheet.</p><p>In its financial statements, Google says that if the government assesses its income in later years in a similar fashion to the company\u2019s 2008 income, its tax \u2018impact\u2019 could rise to Rs 480 crore.</p><p>Apart from these three, a whole range of other tech companies in India have received tax notices, Nokia (about Rs 2,000 crore), and IBM India (Rs 1,090 crore) being the more prominent ones. But it\u2019s Apple, Google and Microsoft that have faced international scrutiny for their tax practices. Let\u2019s look at their run-ins with the Indian taxman.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Family Relationships</p><p>The subsidiaries of all three companies in India perform a whole range of functions \u2014 from research to customer support to actively marketing to local consumers. As Vikram Doshi, partner, tax and regulatory services at KPMG, points out, tech companies fall along a broad spectrum. At one extreme are those whose operations in India are solely focused on servicing group companies around the world.</p><p>\u201cAt the other extreme are companies focused on the potential of the domestic market and of targeting consumers here.\u201d In actual practice many companies do both and fall, therefore, somewhere in the middle.</p><p>And depending on the market they serve, whether foreign or domestic, and whether \u2018customers\u2019 are in-house \u2014 that is, other group companies \u2014 or people buying iPads, the tax implications vary. Take Microsoft for instance. It operates separate companies in India, each focused on a different line of business. Microsoft India handles marketing for the company\u2019s products, such as Office or Windows 8.</p><p>While it focuses on the domestic market, two sister companies (see Big Tech\u2019s India...) focus on servicing group companies. ET Magazine approached Microsoft with a list of questions but there was no response till the time of going to press. Given the range of activities of Microsoft\u2019s India operations, it\u2019s no surprise that the kind of tax notices and disputes it faces span a spectrum.</p><p>Take Microsoft India which provides marketing support services to the group\u2019s Singapore arm. It claimed that such services, aimed at drumming up customers in India, qualified as service exports and were therefore tax exempt. The taxman disagreed with the result that the company now faces a total of Rs 347 crore in service taxes due as of 2012. The dispute is in the courts. It\u2019s worth recognising an interesting fact about the ways the MNC tech companies in India earn their revenue.</p><p>Quite apart from support or R&amp;D services to overseas group companies (important for both Google and Microsoft), all three companies have a substantial base of domestic customers with whom they do business. Except for Apple, both Google and Microsoft however, record almost all their income as coming from overseas group companies (well over 80%), irrespective of whether they serve other group companies or sell to Indian customers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And while Apple books revenue in India from domestic customers, it buys over Rs 1,148 crore of goods from a fellow subsidiary in Ireland. Why would MNC tech companies in India structure their businesses in such a way as to treat even income from domestic consumers as income earned from overseas parents?</p><p>No Permanent Presence?</p><p>Google\u2019s tax issues with Indian authorities are about its Adwords advertising service under which a person can buy the right to have their ads displayed on Google when certain text is searched. A florist, for example, might buy the right to have his ads displayed whenever anyone searches for the words \u2018flowers\u2019 or \u2018birthday\u2019.</p><p>From the taxman\u2019s point of view though, here\u2019s what\u2019s important: one of Google India\u2019s roles is to pitch to customers the benefits of buying Adwords on Google \u2014 it\u2019s essentially a marketer and distributor for the Adwords program in India, even as the technology infrastructure that makes the Adwords programme possible was developed and is managed elsewhere.</p><p>When an Indian customer books an ad, Google Ireland charges Google India a \u2018distribution fee\u2019 for each ad sold to an Indian customer\u2014 such fees essentially reflect a cost of running and maintaining such infrastructure. And Google India meanwhile, calculates its revenues, net of such fees. Essentially the money goes on a round trip \u2014 from the Indian customer to Google Ireland, and then back to Google India, after netting out fees.</p><p>The sums involved are substantial. Google India \u2018paid\u2019 a distribution fee of Rs 570 crore to Google Ireland, and booked revenues of Rs 337 crore from its Irish sister company in 2011-12 (its unclear how much of this is from the Adwords program).</p><p>Indian tax authorities have taken issue with this, and argued, in effect that even that Rs 570 crore should show up in the books of the Indian company and be taxed. If the tax authorities prevail in their view, Google could be forced to stump up as much as Rs 480 crore in taxes and interest across various years.</p><p>Incidentally, as news reports and analyses have shown, Google routes 88% of its sales outside the US through its Irish subsidiary.</p><p>There\u2019s another twist to the tax complications with Adwords as well \u2014 and that\u2019s on the customer\u2019s side.</p><p>Tax authorities have claimed that when an Indian customer buys Adwords from Google Ireland, it is required by tax law to deduct tax at source before hand.</p><p>In April though, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Kolkata ruled that this wasn\u2019t required, since Google Ireland did not have a \u2018permanent establishment\u2019 in India, and under the terms of an India-Ireland tax treaty, no taxes needed to be withheld by the Indian customer.</p><p>ET Magazine approached Google with a set of queries. A spokesperson responded: \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate.</p><p>The reality is that most governments use tax incentives to attract foreign investment that creates jobs and economic growth and, naturally, companies respond to those incentives.</p><p>It\u2019s one of the main reasons Google located our international HQ in Ireland. If politicians don\u2019t like those laws, they have the power to change them.</p><p>Overall, our effective global corporate tax rate in 2012 was almost 20%.\u201d Even if Google India did have to book all the Adwords revenue from Indian customers, there\u2019s still a problem.</p><p>Since the Google site, and the back-end infrastructure supporting it, was not developed by Google India, its undeniable that at least a part of Adwords revenue in India has to be paid to the entity in the Google corporate universe which did so (though that\u2019s unlikely to be Google Ireland).</p><p>\u201cThe question is: how much in compensation or fee needs to be remitted by Google India,\u201d asks an accountant with one of the Big Four audit firms.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Arms Length</p><p>Given that a huge chunk of earnings of MNC tech companies\u2019 India arms are actually revenues from group companies elsewhere, or payments to them, the issue of what accountants call \u2018transfer pricing\u2019 is almost bound to arise. The problem arises when two companies, both under effectively the same management, trade goods or services with each other or do any kind of deal.</p><p>The \u2018price\u2019 at which that deal happens is effectively not a market-determined one, because management can decide which company should \u2018profit\u2019 from the deal \u2014 and quite often the criterion is to allocate the profits to the company located in a country or region where taxes are lower. In this way, the company in the \u2018high\u2019 tax country (like India) would record a loss and hence pay no tax. \u201cWhen it comes to such intercompany transactions, almost the only issue of relevance is transfer pricing,\u201d points out Doshi.</p><p>\u201cTransfer pricing issues are now centre stage when it comes to taxation of such international transactions between two group companies,\u201d agrees Aseem Chawla, partner at MPC Legal. In 2012-13 according to reports, the Indian tax authorities made transfer pricing \u2018adjustments\u2019 to the tune of over Rs 70,000 crore, in 3,200 cases, up from Rs 44,500 crore in 1,343 cases a year earlier.</p><p>Such adjustments effectively involve tweaking the taxable income earned by an Indian company from an international deal to reflect what the department would consider a \u2018fair\u2019 price \u2014 this is often based on the principle that there should be arms length relationship between the two companies involved. In other words, what would the terms of the contract be if the two companies were unrelated to each other, and each was trying to get the best terms for itself?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this \u2018fair\u2019 price is often a point of contention and litigation. The bulk of Microsoft India\u2019s tax disputes is around the issue of transfer pricing \u2014 the amount in dispute is around Rs 1,683 crore in revenue booked by Microsoft India\u2019s R&amp;D arm from its US parent. The funds are routed through an Irish fellow subsidiary, which operates as a central financial hub for the tech giant.</p><p>And, interestingly, as a US Senate subcommittee investigation of both Apple and Microsoft showed, Irish subsidiaries hold significant rights to the companies\u2019 intellectual property. \u201cFor technology companies, Ireland has been an important jurisdiction in which to house intellectual property rights. The IP protection regime is strong, and in addition, the tax rate is low, making it an ideal location,\u201d says Doshi.</p><p>Only the Beginning?</p><p>Indeed intellectual property, and how a customer at the retail end pays for it, and who they pay, is the other twist in this tale. A few years ago, Microsoft became the centre of a major tax case, which eventually led to critical changes in law, with retrospective effect. When we buy software such as Windows 8, are we buying a good (like a CD), or are we simply acquiring a licence to use that software, albeit indefinitely? Despite the fact that software buyers sign a licence agreement with Microsoft, when they buy software, thus implying that the company itself thinks of the deal as a licencing agreement, the company actually argued before the taxman in a different way. It claimed that buyers were being sold a copyrighted article, not acquiring a licence.</p><p>That licencing actually happened offshore, between various Microsoft entities, in a complicated series of deals. Customers bought the software in India from distributors (not Microsoft itself ), who in turn imported the software from Microsoft Singapore. The key here is how these two different types of revenue are taxed. If a customer is merely buying a good, earnings from it are taxed only if the seller has a presence in India.</p><p>If, instead, what we pay is royalty for acquiring a licence to use a copyrighted software, then any payments by Indian customers can be taxed in India before the funds are remitted overseas. Since Indian customers were buying the software not from Microsoft directly, but from its distributors in the country, and since Microsoft USA or Microsoft Singapore does not have a presence in India, there was no question of taxing Microsoft. On the other hand, if the customer was paying a royalty, then tax was implied even if the seller had no physical presence in the country.</p><p>The taxman disagreed with this reasoning and so did the Indian government which closed off this avenue of argument by amending the Income Tax Act last year, with retrospective effect. Of all three companies, it is Apple that has the least tax disputes. But that may well not last. Apple\u2019s revenue was Rs 2,003 crore in 2011-12 up sharply from Rs 620 crore in 2010-11. It\u2019s likely to have gone up even further in 2012-13. All this makes it a tempting target for tax authorities hungry for revenue.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTMS-20719576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTMS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58R0-DPX1-JB3N-T39X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362627</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2138\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

It is due to be written into law in the autumn 2019 budget and come into effect from April 2020.\u00a0</p><p>It is estimated that the tax will raise more than \u00a3400 million for the UK Treasury by 2022. There has been public outcry at the small amounts of tax the likes of Google have paid in Britain. Sources close to Sajid Javid, the new Chancellor, said he was yet to announce his public position on the issue, which is seen by the Trump administration as a \"tax grab\" on American companies.</p><p>Liz Truss, the new International Trade Secretary, has privately expressed concerns that tightening rules against US tech companies could make securing a trade deal harder, according to a well-placed source.</p><p>The DIT said: \"The Prime Minister and President have repeatedly expressed their committed to delivering an ambitious UK-US free trade agreement and to start negotiations as soon as possible after we have left the EU, most recently in their phone call last week.\u00a0</p><p>\"We have laid the groundwork for negotiations through our Trade and Investment Working Group and are now preparing to start negotiations as soon as possible.\"</p><p>                   Cold, hard logic of Washington politics dampens hopes for a deal\u00a0                   </p><p>When Donald Trump was musing in private about a Boris Johnson premiership last month one thing became clear to those listening: he would be with his new counterpart all the way on Brexit.</p><p>Deal or no deal come Oct 31, the US president would stand by his \"friend\". \"His position is to support Boris and sustain Boris,\" said a source close to the White House who heard the remarks.</p><p>Amid the transatlantic back-slapping, hopes for a UK-US free trade deal - one that could be done quickly as a symbol of Britain's post-EU future - have re-entered the spotlight.</p><p>Liz Truss named the deal her \"number one priority\" and met Woody Johnson, America's UK ambassador, within days of taking the job.</p><p>Boris Johnson and Mr Trump discussed the topic on their first phone call as joint world leaders and promised to \"immediately deepen and expand\" their nations' trade relationship when Brexit is done.</p><p>The message has been heard loud and clear by British diplomats too, who are now seeking to turn calls for a \"turbo-charged\" process into a reality without breaking rules about not starting formal negotiations.</p><p>And yet, according to more than a dozen figures tapped into early talks, little has changed in the nuts and bolts.</p><p>The cold hard logic of Washington politics remains.</p><p>Liam Fox, dismissed as international trade secretary last week after three years, had that hammered home to him during a Washington trip last month.</p><p>In a meeting with Ron Wyden, the most senior Democrat on the Senate finance committee, Mr Fox was given something between a warning and a threat.</p><p>\"There should not be any negotiations on a trade deal as long as as a digital services tax is being pursued by Britain,\" Mr Wyden told Mr Fox, or words to that effect. During the same trip an identical message was delivered by Chuck Grassley, the committee's top Republican senator.</p><p>Such remarks have underscored what British officials now see as a significant threat to the hopes of speedy trade deal. The policy in question, a &#x2028;2 per cent tax on UK revenues for big tech companies, is due to become law in this autumn's budget.</p><p>There are also persistent murmurs about the UK's preparedness to launch into full scale negotiations on Nov 1.</p><p>Much of the hold-up is unavoidable, as Britain's trade relationship with the US depends on its trade relationship with the EU post-Brexit.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/27/donald-trump-boris-johnson-working-substantial-post-brexit-trade/\">Brexit | The best comment and analysis</url></p><p>In other areas there is more culpability. America has published its trade deal priorities, some 5,000 words of \"summary\" targets, and held public hearings about them. Britain has done neither.</p><p>One figure in a US business body &#x2028;being kept abreast with talks doubted the quality of the UK's negotiators. \"They have not done trade deal negotiations for 46 years,\" the source said, referring to the date Britain joined the European Economic Community. \"I don't really know if they can do it. This is a new game for them.\"</p><p>Some Republicans are lobbying for a deal to be done in 2020, seeing it as triple-whammy: strengthen relations with Britain, help American firms and hand Mr Trump a win he can sell before the Nov 2020 election.</p><p>It is not impossible. America struck a trade deal with South Korea after around a year of negotiations.</p><p>Other potential pitfalls include the Brexit date being pushed back and the Democrats, who hold a majority in the House of Representatives, refusing to vote any deal through.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr Trump has only 15 months left in his first term - and even in trade, the UK deal is at best third on his priority list, behind passing his renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement and resolving the confrontation with China.</p><p>Then there are the talks themselves. Britain has already been hit with tariffs once by the Trump administration, affecting steel exports to the US.</p><p>One ex-cabinet member dismissed in Mr Johnson's \"Night of the Blond Knives'\" believes a face-saving agreement could be struck next year, perhaps around regulations - but the chances of completing a meaningful trade deal by the end of 2020 were close to zero. By then Mr Trump, along with his burgeoning relationship with Mr Johnson, could be political history.</p><p>A spokesman for the Department of International Trade said: \"The Prime Minister and President have repeatedly expressed their committed to delivering an ambitious UK-US free trade agreement and to start negotiations as soon as possible after we have left the EU, most recently in their phone call last week.\u00a0</p><p>\"We have laid the groundwork for negotiations through our Trade and Investment Working Group and are now preparing to start negotiations as soon as possible.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-54968588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPY-06X1-F021-621W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1138\"/><timeReceived>8:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 2, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.

One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the  top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford  Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit  the tape.  We will bring them to you.  Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.  Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent,  the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher.  Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the  top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford  Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit  the tape.  We will bring them to you.  Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.  Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent,  the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher.  Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p>And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p>Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p>As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p>Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p>Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p>We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p>There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p>Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p>Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p>Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p>And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p>Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p>Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p>The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p>First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p>You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p>I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p>So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p>Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p>But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p>But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p>Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p>However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p>PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p>PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p>So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p>So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p>So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p>Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p>PACHAL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p>And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p>Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p>And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p>What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p>But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p>So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p>There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p>On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p>We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p>Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p>Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p>Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p>Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p>And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p>Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p>TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p>Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p>It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p>Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p>CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p>Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p>Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p>Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p>The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.   Stay tuned for our live coverage of that, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell.  Maria Bartiromo  will be hosting a discussion shortly at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture capitalists and founder's partner,  Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October 26th.  Your stop stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p>Earnings blitz on Wall Street.  Among the top names were reporting before  the bell, Twitter, Ford, UPS, and Comcast.  Twitter and Ford hitting the  tape earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both of  those companies topping expectations.</p><p>Twitter share are up eight percent.  Again, a beat on the bottom line, the  top line and a four million additional users.  Monthly average users added  in the quarter.</p><p>And it doesn't stop there.  After the bell today, we expect to hear from  Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet.  We'll bring you all the  numbers and analysis, as they come.</p><p>Futures are searching for direction this morning.  Dow Futures are up right  now though.  We have gains across the Board with a 36-point gain on the Dow  Futures.  Watching that 10-year yield with it moving up to multi month  highs yesterday, 2.44 percent is where the 10-year ended yesterday.  Higher  interest rates could hurt stocks.</p><p>Over in Europe, the markets there are moving up with gains in England,  France, and Germany.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher as well.  Well, mixed markets.   The Nikkei in Japan and Shanghai were both higher.</p><p>Getting a budget done.  The house is expected to vote on the senate version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move critical for the party, as it  pushes forward with the White House is called to get tax reform passed this  year.</p><p>The latest, as a new Fox News poll shows that the majority of Americans are  upset with our current tax system.  They want it fixed.</p><p>The quest to find the next Federal Reserve chief.  While the commander-in- chief expresses support for Janet Yellen.  He says he wants to leave his  own mark.  More on the looming decision ahead.</p><p>And President Trump blasting democrats.  The president calling the funding  as a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and the DNC disgraceful while  speaking with Lou Dobbs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Don't forget, Hillary  Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p>And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p>Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p>Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p>So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p>An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p>Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p>So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p>MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p>MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p>And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p>The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p>At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p>Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p>ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p>MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p>He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p>Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p>Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p>But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p>Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p>Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p>Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p>Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p>The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p>I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Your kids into Legos?</p><p>MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p>MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p>KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p>So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p>I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p>And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p>So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p>And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p>KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p>So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p>They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p>But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p>Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p>They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.

I'm Dagen McDowell.   Maria Bartiromo will be hosting a discussion shortly at the future  Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture  capitalists and Founders Fund Partner Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October  26th.  And we have your top stories for you right now at 8:00 a.m.   Eastern.  And earnings extravaganza on Wall Street among the top names  reporting before the bell, Ford, UPS, and Comcast, Twitter and Ford coming  out earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p>Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p>Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p>Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p>Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p>KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p>MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p>MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p>MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p>MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p>MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p>REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p>MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p>MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p>BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p>And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p>BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p>BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.  New security changes for  travelers including Americans flying into the U.S.  What you need to know  before you head to the airport.  Plus, would you really let these shoes  touch the ground?  Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p>PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p>And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p>THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p>And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p>Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p>And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p>And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p>So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p>THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p>THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p>Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p>And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p>And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p>And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p>And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p>THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p>THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p>The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p>THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p>THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p>You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p>THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p>THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p>THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p>MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p>KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p>MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p>Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p>And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p>The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the  top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford  Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit  the tape.  We will bring them to you.  Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.  Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent,  the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher.  Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the  top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford  Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit  the tape.  We will bring them to you.  Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.  Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent,  the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher.  Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p>And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p>Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p>As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p>Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p>Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p>We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p>There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p>Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p>Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p>Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p>And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p>Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p>Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p>The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p>First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p>You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p>I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p>So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p>Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p>But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p>But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p>Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p>However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p>PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p>PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p>So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p>So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p>So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p>Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p>PACHAL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p>And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p>Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p>And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p>What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p>But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p>So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p>There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p>On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p>We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p>Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p>Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p>Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p>Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p>And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p>Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p>TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p>Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p>It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p>Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p>CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p>Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p>Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p>Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p>The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.

She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p>And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p>Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p>Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p>So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p>An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p>Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p>So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p>MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p>MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p>And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p>The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p>At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p>Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p>ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p>MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p>He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p>Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p>Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p>But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p>Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p>Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p>Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p>Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p>The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p>I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Your kids into Legos?</p><p>MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p>MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p>KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p>So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p>I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p>And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p>So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p>And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p>KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p>So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p>They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p>But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p>Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p>They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.  They lowered their expenses for  advertising and promotion.  So Ford is a winner.  Up 1.5 percent.</p><p>Bu as I said a very busy day and we'll watch for Amazon and Google today  after the bell.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Than you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>Coming up, we're waiting for Maria Bartiromo to take the stage with venture  capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi  Arabia.

I'm Dagen McDowell.   Maria Bartiromo will be hosting a discussion shortly at the future  Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture  capitalists and Founders Fund Partner Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October  26th.  And we have your top stories for you right now at 8:00 a.m.   Eastern.  And earnings extravaganza on Wall Street among the top names  reporting before the bell, Ford, UPS, and Comcast, Twitter and Ford coming  out earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p>Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p>Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p>Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p>Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p>KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p>MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p>MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p>MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p>MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p>MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p>REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p>MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p>MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p>BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p>And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p>BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p>BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.

Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p>PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p>And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p>THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p>And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p>Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p>And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p>And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p>So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p>THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p>THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p>Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p>And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p>And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p>And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p>And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p>THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p>THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p>The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p>THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p>THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p>You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p>THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p>THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p>THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p>MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p>KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p>MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p>Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p>And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p>The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p> Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p> Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p> Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p> In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p> President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p> Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p> Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p> I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p> We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p> Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p> We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p> But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p> So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p> KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p> Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p> What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p> But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p> It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p> As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p> So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p> KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p> So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p> If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p> You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p> I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p> MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p> So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p> So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p> Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p> Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p> 401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p> We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p> Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p> It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p> The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p> Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p> So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p> One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p> Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p> According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p> All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p> A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p> Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p> Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p> And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p> And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p> It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p> And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p> President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p> We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p> So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p> The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p> LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p> We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p> And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p> Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p> So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p> LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p> It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p> And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p> I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p> Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.

Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p> Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p> Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.

Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p> But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p> First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p> BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p> BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p> BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p> We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p> Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p> Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p> And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p> BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p> A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p> I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p> And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p> We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p> Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p> As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p> Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p> Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p> We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p> There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p> Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p> Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p> Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p> And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p> Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p> Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p> The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p> First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p> You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p> MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p> I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p> PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p> So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p> Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p> PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p> But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p> But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p> Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p> However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p> PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p> PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p> So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p> PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p> So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p> So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p> Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p> PACHAL:  You too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p> And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p> Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p> Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p> And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p> And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p> What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p> But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p> So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p> Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p> There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p> On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p> And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p> We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p> Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p> CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p> Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p> Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p> Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p> And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p> Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p> TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p> Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p> It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p> Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p> CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p> Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p> Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p> Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p> Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p> The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.

We have gains across the Board with a 36-point gain on the Dow  Futures.  Watching that 10-year yield with it moving up to multi month  highs yesterday, 2.44 percent is where the 10-year ended yesterday.  Higher  interest rates could hurt stocks.</p><p> Over in Europe, the markets there are moving up with gains in England,  France, and Germany.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher as well.  Well, mixed markets.   The Nikkei in Japan and Shanghai were both higher.</p><p> Getting a budget done.  The house is expected to vote on the senate version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move critical for the party, as it  pushes forward with the White House is called to get tax reform passed this  year.</p><p> The latest, as a new Fox News poll shows that the majority of Americans are  upset with our current tax system.  They want it fixed.</p><p> The quest to find the next Federal Reserve chief.  While the commander-in- chief expresses support for Janet Yellen.  He says he wants to leave his  own mark.  More on the looming decision ahead.</p><p> And President Trump blasting democrats.  The president calling the funding  as a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and the DNC disgraceful while  speaking with Lou Dobbs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Don't forget, Hillary  Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p> And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p> Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p> ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p> ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p> Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p> So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p> An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p> ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p> Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p> So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p> MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p> ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p> MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p> ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p> And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p> The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p> At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p> Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p> ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p> ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p> MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p> He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p> Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p> MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p> Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p> ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p> You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p> But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p> Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p> Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p> Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p> Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p> The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p> I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p> Your kids into Legos?</p><p> MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p> MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p> KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p> So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p> I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p> And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p> MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p> So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p> And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p> KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p> So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p> They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p> But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p> Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p> They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.  They lowered their expenses for  advertising and promotion.  So Ford is a winner.  Up 1.5 percent.</p><p> Bu as I said a very busy day and we'll watch for Amazon and Google today  after the bell.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Than you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p> Coming up, we're waiting for Maria Bartiromo to take the stage with venture  capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi  Arabia.  You do not want to miss a minute of it.

I'm Dagen McDowell.   Maria Bartiromo will be hosting a discussion shortly at the future  Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture  capitalists and Founders Fund Partner Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October  26th.  And we have your top stories for you right now at 8:00 a.m.   Eastern.  And earnings extravaganza on Wall Street among the top names  reporting before the bell, Ford, UPS, and Comcast, Twitter and Ford coming  out earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p> Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p> Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p> Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p> Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p> KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p> MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p> MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p> MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p> MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p> MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p> MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p> MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p> MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p> REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p> BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p> MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p> MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p> BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p> And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p> BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p> BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p> BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.

Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p> PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p> And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p> THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p> And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p> Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p> And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p> THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p> And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p> So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p> THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p> THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p> THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p> Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p> And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p> And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p> And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p> And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p> THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p> THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p> The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p> THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p> THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p> THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p> You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p> THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p> THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p> THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p> RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p> MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p> KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p> MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p> VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p> VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p> Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p> And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p> The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p> Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p> Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p> Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p> In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p> President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p> Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p> Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p> I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p> We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p> Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p> We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p> But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p> So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p> KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p> Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p> What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p> But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p> It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p> As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p> So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p> KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p> So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p> If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p> You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p> I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p> MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p> So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p> So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p> Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p> Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p> 401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p> We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p> Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p> It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p> The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p> Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p> So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p> One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p> Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p> According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p> All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p> A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p> Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p> Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p> And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p> And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  HouseAstros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p> It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p> And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p> President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p> We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p> So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p> The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p> LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p> We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p> And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p> Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p> So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p> LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p> It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p> And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p> I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p> Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.

We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p> Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.

What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p> But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p> First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p> BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p> BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p> BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p> UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p> We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p> Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p> Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p> And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p> BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p> A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p> I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.  We  will tell you about that.  And then the earnings keep on rolling this  morning when the busiest days of the quarter.  New equipment, bigger jets,  will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season.   We will tell you about that, earnings on tax.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the  top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford  Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit  the tape.  We will bring them to you.  Duncan brand just reporting hitting  the tape earlier this hour.  </p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss,  as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months.  The  earnings news does not stop there.  We've got a big night tonight after the  closing bell.  We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.  Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent,  the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher.  Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p>And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p>Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p>As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p>Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p>Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p>We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p>There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p>Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p>Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p>Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p>And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p>Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p>Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p>The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p>First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p>You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p>I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p>So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p>Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p>But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p>But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p>Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p>However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p>PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p>PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p>So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p>So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p>So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p>Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p>PACHAL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p>And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p>Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p>And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p>What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p>But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p>So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p>There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p>On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p>We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p>Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p>Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p>Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p>Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p>And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p>Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p>TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p>Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p>It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p>Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p>CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p>Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p>Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p>Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p>The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.   Stay tuned for our live coverage of that, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell.  Maria Bartiromo  will be hosting a discussion shortly at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture capitalists and founder's partner,  Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October 26th.  Your stop stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p>Earnings blitz on Wall Street.  Among the top names were reporting before  the bell, Twitter, Ford, UPS, and Comcast.  Twitter and Ford hitting the  tape earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both of  those companies topping expectations.</p><p>Twitter share are up eight percent.  Again, a beat on the bottom line, the  top line and a four million additional users.  Monthly average users added  in the quarter.</p><p>And it doesn't stop there.  After the bell today, we expect to hear from  Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet.  We'll bring you all the  numbers and analysis, as they come.</p><p>Futures are searching for direction this morning.  Dow Futures are up right  now though.  We have gains across the Board with a 36-point gain on the Dow  Futures.  Watching that 10-year yield with it moving up to multi month  highs yesterday, 2.44 percent is where the 10-year ended yesterday.  Higher  interest rates could hurt stocks.</p><p>Over in Europe, the markets there are moving up with gains in England,  France, and Germany.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher as well.  Well, mixed markets.   The Nikkei in Japan and Shanghai were both higher.</p><p>Getting a budget done.  The house is expected to vote on the senate version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move critical for the party, as it  pushes forward with the White House is called to get tax reform passed this  year.</p><p>The latest, as a new Fox News poll shows that the majority of Americans are  upset with our current tax system.  They want it fixed.</p><p>The quest to find the next Federal Reserve chief.  While the commander-in- chief expresses support for Janet Yellen.  He says he wants to leave his  own mark.  More on the looming decision ahead.</p><p>And President Trump blasting democrats.  The president calling the funding  as a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and the DNC disgraceful while  speaking with Lou Dobbs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Don't forget, Hillary  Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p>And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p>Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p>Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p>So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p>An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p>Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p>So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p>MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p>MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p>And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p>The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p>At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p>Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p>ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p>MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p>He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p>Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p>Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p>But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p>Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p>Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p>Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p>Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p>The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p>I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Your kids into Legos?</p><p>MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p>MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p>KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p>So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p>I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p>And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p>So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p>And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p>KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p>So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p>They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p>But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p>Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p>They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.  They lowered their expenses for  advertising and promotion.  So Ford is a winner.  Up 1.5 percent.</p><p>Bu as I said a very busy day and we'll watch for Amazon and Google today  after the bell.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Than you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>Coming up, we're waiting for Maria Bartiromo to take the stage with venture  capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi  Arabia.  You do not want to miss a minute of it.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of \"Mornings  with Maria.\"</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen McDowell.   Maria Bartiromo will be hosting a discussion shortly at the future  Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture  capitalists and Founders Fund Partner Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October  26th.  And we have your top stories for you right now at 8:00 a.m.   Eastern.  And earnings extravaganza on Wall Street among the top names  reporting before the bell, Ford, UPS, and Comcast, Twitter and Ford coming  out earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p>Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p>Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p>Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p>Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p>KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p>MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p>MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p>MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p>MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p>MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p>REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p>MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p>MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p>BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p>And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p>BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p>BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.  New security changes for  travelers including Americans flying into the U.S.  What you need to know  before you head to the airport.  Plus, would you really let these shoes  touch the ground?  Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p>PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p>And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p>THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p>And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p>Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p>And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p>And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p>So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p>THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p>THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p>Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p>And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p>And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p>And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p>And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p>THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p>THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p>The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p>THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p>THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p>You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p>THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p>THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p>THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p>MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p>KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p>MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p>Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p>And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p>The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p>President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p>KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p>President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p>LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p>LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p>LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.

We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.

What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p>BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p>BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p>Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p>KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p>KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p>And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p>Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p>As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p>Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p>Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p>We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p>There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p>Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p>Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p>President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p>Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p>And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p>Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p>Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p>The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p>First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p>You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p>I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p>So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p>Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p>But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p>But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p>Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p>However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p>PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p>PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p>So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p>So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p>So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p>Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p>PACHAL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p>And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p>Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p>And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p>What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p>But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p>So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p>Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p>There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p>On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p>SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p>We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p>Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p>Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p>Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p>Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p>And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p>Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p>TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p>Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p>It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p>Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p>CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p>Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p>Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p>Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p>Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p>The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.   Stay tuned for our live coverage of that, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell.  Maria Bartiromo  will be hosting a discussion shortly at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture capitalists and founder's partner,  Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October 26th.  Your stop stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p>Earnings blitz on Wall Street.  Among the top names were reporting before  the bell, Twitter, Ford, UPS, and Comcast.  Twitter and Ford hitting the  tape earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both of  those companies topping expectations.</p><p>Twitter share are up eight percent.  Again, a beat on the bottom line, the  top line and a four million additional users.  Monthly average users added  in the quarter.</p><p>And it doesn't stop there.  After the bell today, we expect to hear from  Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet.  We'll bring you all the  numbers and analysis, as they come.</p><p>Futures are searching for direction this morning.  Dow Futures are up right  now though.  We have gains across the Board with a 36-point gain on the Dow  Futures.  Watching that 10-year yield with it moving up to multi month  highs yesterday, 2.44 percent is where the 10-year ended yesterday.  Higher  interest rates could hurt stocks.</p><p>Over in Europe, the markets there are moving up with gains in England,  France, and Germany.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher as well.  Well, mixed markets.   The Nikkei in Japan and Shanghai were both higher.</p><p>Getting a budget done.  The house is expected to vote on the senate version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move critical for the party, as it  pushes forward with the White House is called to get tax reform passed this  year.</p><p>The latest, as a new Fox News poll shows that the majority of Americans are  upset with our current tax system.  They want it fixed.</p><p>The quest to find the next Federal Reserve chief.  While the commander-in- chief expresses support for Janet Yellen.  He says he wants to leave his  own mark.  More on the looming decision ahead.</p><p>And President Trump blasting democrats.  The president calling the funding  as a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and the DNC disgraceful while  speaking with Lou Dobbs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Don't forget, Hillary  Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p>And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p>Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p>Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p>So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p>An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p>ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p>Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p>So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p>MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p>MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p>And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p>The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p>At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p>Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p>ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p>ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p>MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p>He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p>Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p>KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p>ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p>Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p>You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p>But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p>Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p>Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p>Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p>Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p>The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p>I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>Your kids into Legos?</p><p>MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p>MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p>KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p>KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p>So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p>I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p>And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p>So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p>And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p>KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p>So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p>They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p>But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p>Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p>They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.  They lowered their expenses for  advertising and promotion.  So Ford is a winner.  Up 1.5 percent.</p><p>Bu as I said a very busy day and we'll watch for Amazon and Google today  after the bell.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Than you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>Coming up, we're waiting for Maria Bartiromo to take the stage with venture  capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi  Arabia.

Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p>Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p>Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p>Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p>Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p>KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p>MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p>MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p>MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p>MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p>MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p>MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p>REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p>BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p>MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p>MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p>KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p>BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p>And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p>BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p>BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p>BLACK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.  New security changes for  travelers including Americans flying into the U.S.  What you need to know  before you head to the airport.  Plus, would you really let these shoes  touch the ground?  Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p>PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p>And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p>THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p>And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p>Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p>And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p>And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p>So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p>THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p>THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p>Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p>And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p>And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p>And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p>And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p>THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p>THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p>The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p>THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p>THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p>THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p>You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p>THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p>THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p>THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p>THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p>RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p>MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p>KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p>MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p>Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p>And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p>The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p> Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p> Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p> Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p> In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p> President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p> Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p> Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p> I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p> We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p> Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p> We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p> But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p> So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p> KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p> Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p> What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p> But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p> It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p> As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p> So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p> KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p> So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p> If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p> You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p> I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p> MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p> So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p> So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p> Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p> Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p> 401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p> We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p> Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p> It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p> The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p> Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p> So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p> One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p> Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p> According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p> All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p> A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p> Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p> Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p> And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p> And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  HouseAstros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p> It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p> And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p> President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p> We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p> So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p> The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p> LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p> We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p> And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p> Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p> So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p> LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p> It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p> And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p> I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p> Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.

What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p> But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p> First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p> BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p> BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p> BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p> UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p> We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p> Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p> Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p> And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p> BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p> A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p> I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us  live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment  Initiative, here's Maria Bartiromo with the special edition of MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody!  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday.   Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting  before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast.  It does not stop  there, we got a big night tonight.  We are expected to hear from Amazon,  Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we  will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes.  Stay with  us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p> Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW  Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not  even a point.  Nasdaq Composite up not even a point. </p><p> Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the  European zone.  FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in  Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices  there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea.  The Shanghai Composite  was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.  </p><p> Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing.  The House expected  to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today.   This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what  the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come  together to get this passed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well I think we're going to  get it.  I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House  is looking really good.  They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p> In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of  calls.  I said, \"Fellows, please no changes.  Just pass it along.\"  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K  retirement plans included in the tax bill.  We're also taking a look at the  deductions and the fight going on there.  </p><p> President Trump blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief  calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC  \"disgraceful.\"  Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p> Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this  morning after sexual assault accusations.  The details after five women  have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p> Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all  U.S. bound flight that's going into effect.  One airline is making it a  little easier though for you to fly.  What you need to know before headed  to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p> I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  We got a big panel coming up.   I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the  technology firm.</p><p> We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology.  It's another  big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I  mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p> Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning.  Bechtel  Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here.  And the CEO and President of Evercore,  Ralph Schlosstein is with us.  And the New York Stock Exchange President,  Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall  Street want a piece of that action.</p><p> We'll talk about all of that coming up.  Joining me from New York this  morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy.  And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter  this morning, Ryan Knutson with us.  Good morning everybody. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Nice to  see you.  How's the weather over there?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, look, I want to talk about tech.  The weather is  gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually.  So  it's pretty warm here.</p><p> But technology has not been warm, you know that.  These stocks have been  trading down going into this earnings period Mike.  What do you think about  the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the  expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't really think so Maria.  So I see it more as a basing  pattern.  They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of  the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p> So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent.  I'm  really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue  the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER:  There's also a  little bit more concern --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think Ryan?</p><p> KNUTSON:  There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sorry.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot  tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the  fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and  there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might  create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  May I add one thing Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Actually yes.  Yes, please.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady  Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax  bill trying to put it together.  </p><p> Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are  still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what  President Trump said on Twitter on Monday.  I just think that this is one  of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American  taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a  lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the point Dagen?  I mean is it significant money that  they're trying to save?  I know every penny counts here given the $20  trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around  spending.</p><p> What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans  have no savings?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this  tax overhaul.  I think that some of these republicans believe that it will  go unnoticed.  Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it  could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p> But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that  $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K  plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be  affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to.   And obviously they're not getting the match from their company.  And we  know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the  appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons  learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for  retirement.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  I know that you're hot on this because you are a  saver, saver, saver.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I am.  And 401K included.  But so are you.  The two of us have  that same mentality.  Yes.  We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk  about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and  it affects a lot of people.</p><p> It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's  get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment.   Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21  billion.</p><p> As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third  quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out.   Obviously we're going to bring them to you.  Analyst expect the social  media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7  million.</p><p> So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter  reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important  here?</p><p> KNUTSON:  Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter.   They had a huge bump after the election.  There was nine million  subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the  quarter after that.</p><p> So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a  million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter.  But one of the  things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can  make money. </p><p> If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be  the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company.   They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important  in American Fabric of Society.</p><p> You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and  that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant  profit.  One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other  company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass  Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably  going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet,  right?  </p><p> I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader  markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p> MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Amazon obviously.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  These are the names where you've been able to invest  for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in  these names.</p><p> So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the  downside.  I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft  disappoints the market in a big way.  I think these guys are hitting on all  cylinders right now.</p><p> So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said  earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this  morning.  In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell  tonight.  </p><p> Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely  in their sight.  The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget  measure.  That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top  tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's  leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.  </p><p> Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House.   We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one  of the great benefits to the middle class.  I didn't want that to go too  far that's why I ended it very quickly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I  trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things.  You know, there are  certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p> 401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows  how important 401Ks are.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen?  I mean he said  it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street  Journal\" has a great story on this that President Trump seem to surprise  lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the  news over the weekend.  </p><p> We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon.  But it  is still up for discussion.  But I'm just baffled by this because, again,  it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed  contributions.</p><p> Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal  government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan.  But I  want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes  out at retirement.</p><p> It's not like this money is untaxed.  And I think that we -- the financial  industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades  encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult  enough to use an IRA.</p><p> The rules are exceedingly complicated.  So when you now limit how much  somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really  giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how much money are we really talking about in terms  of savings?  I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax  deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p> Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you  won't be able to deduct that.  Maybe they are looking for more money and  they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story  because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that  and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p> So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get  that.  If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting  into the $1.3 trillion in revenue.  So what are we talking about in terms  of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again,  this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes  easier. </p><p> One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with  the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property  tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and  $400,000, that's an idea.  Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it.   Genius.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well there goes the complications.  All right.  We'll keep  talking about that.  But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the  president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded  that dossier that claimed Donald Trump had links to Russia during the  election, that's next.  We're back in a moment.</p><p> Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes  for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll  tell you all about it.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Officials have hit another major roadblock in  the Las Vegas shooting investigation.  Cheryl Casone in New York right now  with details and headlines.  Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria and good morning.  \"ABC News\" is reporting that  a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive  depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p> According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought  software that's used to erase files from a hard drive.  Meanwhile, Mandalay  Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country  days after the shooting and he went to Mexico.  He did though appear on the  Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p> All right.  President Trump slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic  National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him.  The  president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know  anything, she knew nothing.  All of a sudden they found out.  What I was  amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally  discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful.   It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion  GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between President Trump  and Russia.  </p><p> A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign  finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the  dossier.</p><p> Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due  to terrorism concerns and that starts today.  Those measures could include  questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p> Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the  airport three hours before their flight.</p><p> And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to  get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on  another airline.  United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that  currently offers that feature.</p><p> And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series.  The  House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers  but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and  get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.  </p><p> It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home  runs, five of which were in the extra innings.  That series now shifts to  Houston, Maria.  And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back  to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin  is now apologizing this morning.  He is facing accusations of sexual  harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks.   We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p> And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the  series in dramatic fashion as you just heard.  We've got more on what went  on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you live  this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative  here in Riyadh.  </p><p> President Trump is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying  that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever.   Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's  very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way  anymore.</p><p> We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a  lot.  What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable.  The jobs  that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of  Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is  incredible.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with  DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris.   Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL:  Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So we heard the president  talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also  talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the  three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you  see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus  pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about  fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda  in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p> So there's fairness both sides.  We're a consumption economy in the United  States therefore by definition an importer.  But we need to become an  investment economy as a consequence become an exporter. </p><p> The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the  United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be  NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but  China Looms Lodge (ph).  And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a  couple weeks --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Terrific.</p><p> LIVERIS:  -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well.  So I'm all  for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why haven't they been fair so far?  I mean do you agree with  what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this  great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p> LIVERIS:  I do.  I do think it's because of our mindset.  We've spent six  decades since the martial plan the consumer.  I would tell you over and  over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in  things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p> We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy.   So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in  America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p> And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow  these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they  export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And that sort of became the template when we did the  NAFTA deal.  Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem.  I will have all my  jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p> LIVERIS:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're the former head of the president's manufacturing  council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how  do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era.  I think  the 21st Century is a digital century.  I do think automation and factories  are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is  the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We should be investing in factories for all the things that go  with it including human capital.  So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p> Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think  it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA.  Secretary Ross  is incredibly good at this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.</p><p> LIVERIS:  We've known him for a long time --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Of course you have.  Sure.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And we know -- he knows business.  So I really think a sit at the  table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or  China is very necessary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on  splitting into three companies, how is that going?  What can you tell us in  terms of the status?</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well great stock.  We took a little while to close the deal but  we did it as you said in the timeframe you did.  So now we're furiously  putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about  the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and  looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  I know that, yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the  cultures of these three dynamic growth companies.  But look, a great start  and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put  this together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Well it's all three.  I'd say the agricultural company we're  creating will be a category winner.  The materials, chemicals company  category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four  divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p> So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin  we'll have an amazing investor stories.  But we're at all stock price high  right now.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Obviously investors have reacted in it.  Yes.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Investors have seen as a positive move.  And this deal took 10  years in the making Maria.  You and I probably talked about this 10 years  ago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  You're right.</p><p> LIVERIS:  And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale,  not easy but it can be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest  expert.  That's incredible actually.  </p><p> LIVERIS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here  for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell  here.</p><p> LIVERIS:  I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing.  We're  an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030.  We have finished the $22  billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with  Saudi Aramco.</p><p> It's starting up.  The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around  the world.  The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed.   When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want  to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p> And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here.  I believe beyond oil  and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your  panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how  he's going to do it.</p><p> I'm a big fan.  I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you  that we are investors here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here.  I mean  it feels seismic.  Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Thank you.  Great to see you Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p> LIVERIS:  Nice to be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments.  Andrew Liveris there.</p><p> Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan.  There  are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package.

We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course,  these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them,  although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers.  We'll  have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as  well.  </p><p> Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets  right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and  the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction.  In Europe, stocks are  higher as well.  Take a look at the European indices right here, which are  off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC  Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index  in Germany, up 45.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the  Hang Seng and KOSPI.

Rebuilding America, White House  Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas  tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its  infrastructure package.  What that means for your wallet, coming up.   Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore  is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan.  President Trump  weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The opioid is a tremendous  emergency, what's going on there?  The drugs pouring into the country have  gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need  the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President  prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health  emergency.  Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark  Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations.  The  details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against  him.  Uber goes further to target millennials' money.  We're breaking down  the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes,  an Uber credit card.  We'll tell you about it.  </p><p> But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment  Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning.  It's another big  day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be  speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein  is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel.  I'll be on stage with him  later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall  Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco,  huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p> First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on  infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers  in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a  gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion  infrastructure package, that's according to Politico.  Other reports  suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes.  I want to  bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering  Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us,  Brendan, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase?  What  does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of  an impact might that have?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for  infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the  U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10  years in the United States.  So, there has been political consensus, I  would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the  need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for  it.  The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge.  It's not  been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has  traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public  infrastructure in the United States.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this  administration?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first  priority.  What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern  after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're  watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something.  But let  me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi  Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this  new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  The city will be  built on the newest technologies of today.  The opportunity is  unimaginable.  A region that is almost vacant.  There are many dreams from  the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the  large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be  established in NEOM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like an incredible opportunity.  Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years.  You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary.  I think this is so  exciting.  The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of  subtle messages in there too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There were.</p><p> BECHTEL:  For those of us that have been around a while, are very  significant milestones.  But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think  it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030.  It's a  bold, ambitious but achievable plan.  I think an interesting way to talk  about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's.  When we  got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil  pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways.  In the  1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village.   Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> BECHTEL:  And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it  accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP.  So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been  coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable?  All the projects  that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible?  And I said,  again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing  village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region.  I think  the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40  years to go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BECHTEL:  This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to  keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to  change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign  investment, allowing women to drive.  We've talked about that on the panel.   Let me ask you about Copper.  I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper,  it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back  into Copper.  What does that tell you?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things  we're most excited about.  So we felt roughly about a third of all the  Copper concentrators on earth.  I'm particularly focused in Chile and the  Indies.  And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty  good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years,  we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly  by the Copper price.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of  the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes  in everything from cars to your house.  So is it indicative --</p><p> BECHTEL:  Electrical wires.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p> BECHTEL:  Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading  indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly.  So I do think  it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so  Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they  approach CAPEX investments.  And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared  with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a  little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building,  building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that  standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p> BECHTEL:  I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market,  it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king.  It's all about  low cost.  And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost  supply curve.  Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at  Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a  winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants.  I  would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in  the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure.   It's public works.  It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock  commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the  program.</p><p> BECHTEL:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel  joining us there.  Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to  declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens  is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.   We'll tell you about that.  Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the  ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers  some unexpected perks, stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  Markets are flat right now, but it's  all about earnings today.  We are watching the earnings hitting the tape;  that will drive markets.  Things have turned around.  We're looking at a  market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow  Industrials up about 10 points right now.  </p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today.  The company is set to report its  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts  expect earnings of a $1.45 a share.  The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in  the last year.  </p><p> We're also watching shares of Mattel.  The toymaker is set to report its  third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight.  Analysts looking for  earnings there, $0.58 a share.  And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough  year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.  </p><p> Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news  political director.  Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Well, Maria, a number of women have accused  Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor  for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment.  The women talked to CNN about  the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game  Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\"  In a  statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and  he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.  </p><p> Well, President Trump telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public  health emergency on the opioid crisis.  In an interview with Lou Dobbs,  Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  The opioid is a tremendous emergency.  What's going on there?  The  drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've  made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason  we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for  tackling the opioid crisis later on today.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now  stock Narcan in the battle against opioids.  The nasal spray can reverse  the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription  painkillers and heroin.  Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by  more than 18 percent so far, this year.  Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock  to watch today.  </p><p> And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a  credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa.  Besides being  convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable  information about its riders, because they like that.  The card has no fee  and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much  you charge for it.  But again, Maria, how much information are you willing  to give to Uber?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Well, there you go.  They have the data.   They're going to share it.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, robots  officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia.  A robot  has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom.  We will tell you about  that when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I am live this morning on day three of the  Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  For the first  time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday.  It all happened  right here in Saudi Arabia.  Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies  CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell.  Brad, it is nice to have you on the  program.  </p><p> BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES:  Pleasure to be here,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, great to see you.  Here we are in Saudi.  You co-founded  and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies,  and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Talk to us about artificial intelligence.  I feel like, if  you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution  about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the  machines around us can tell us to make people even better.  And so, this is  core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of  the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.  </p><p> A quick example is in the world of Locomotives.  We actually give the  operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy  that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't  break.  So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this  emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our  assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and  really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically  checking the safety and the health of whatever it is.  And that even  applies to human beings, by the way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Absolutely.  We can all be better.  So, what's the operating  system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives?  There's  an operating system on our phones.  As it relates to our industries and  business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our  world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated  data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused  on turning that possibility into action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and  industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200  billion valuations there.  Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is  robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I disagree.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KEYWELL:  You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that  people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can  be derived from these sensors.  And there is a clear argument that gets --  that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that  there'd be autonomous everything.  But these are, you know, the art of  extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the  rest.  This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just  don't see that changing.  </p><p> I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating  their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even  better at what they do.  And I also see a new philosophy that there's going  to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and  kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and  leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into  industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I mean, that's something that he's  committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel.  And this is  going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the  way.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and  he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't  think so?  Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving  around the street than people.  I do envision cities that have operating  systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are  more environmentally responsible.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That makes sense.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's  life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all  the ambient activities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?  </p><p> KEYWELL:  What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these  industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of  investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five,  seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software.  So, it's an  extraordinary time in the world of technology.  And as an entrepreneur, to  find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's  extraordinary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us  all about it.  </p><p> KEYWELL:  Happy to.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> KEYWELL:  OK.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brad Keywell from Uptake.  We'll be right back.

Welcome  back.  Thanks so much for joining us today.  Happy Thursday to you.  It is  Thursday, October 26th.  Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.</p><p> And earnings extravaganza this morning to report.  Among the top names  reporting their third quarter before the opening bell: Ford Motor, UPS and  Comcast.  It does not stop there.  It's an incredibly busy night tonight  after the bell.  We are going to be hearing from Amazon, Microsoft and  Google parent Alphabet.</p><p> We will bring you those numbers and analysis as soon as they hit the tape  and, of course, we are likely to see some market impact from these numbers.</p><p> Right now, futures are searching for direction a bit.  We've got a firmer  tone pretty much but it is a fractional move.  Dow Industrials up 18 points  right now.  That's fractionally higher.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also higher  as well.</p><p> As you see Twitter is hitting the tape right now.  Revenue beating  expectations on the -- as you see the top line -- $590 million in revenue.</p><p> Take a look at the European indices while we watch the Twitter numbers hit  the tape here.  European indices are higher this morning.  FT 100 up almost  half of a percent, CAC 40 same thing up half a percent, and the DAX index  higher by a third of a percent.</p><p> Earnings at Twitter coming in 10 cents a share versus an estimate of 6  cents a share.</p><p> We will check the stock for you in a moment as we check the Asian indices  this morning because Asia basically closed mixed, you had some gains.</p><p> There's Twitter shares, $17.14 a share is where the stock closed yesterday.   And as you can see, it's been trading down going into these numbers.</p><p> Meanwhile the Asian markets are mixed.  Shanghai composite and the Nikkei  average higher overnight.  Hang Seng and the Kospi lower.</p><p> Over in Washington a budget battle continues.  The House is expected to  vote today on the Senate versions of the fiscal 2018 budget.  The move  critical for the party as they push forward with the White House's call to  get tax reform passed this year.</p><p> President Trump told Lou Dobbs last night, he expects the GOP to come  together and get this done.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to get tax cuts and  just pass it along.  Now normally they want to make that 15 points or they  have 20 points and then it has to go back and has to be voted and  everything else.  I said just pass it along.  And they said, they are going  to do that.  And let's see what happens.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It may not be smooth sailing though overall.  The growing  controversy as lawmakers are leaving the door open to making changes to  401(k) retirement plans under this tax bill.</p><p> Amazon hopes the key to success is your home, literally -- the new plan to  deliver packages inside your door.</p><p> And then this, Burger King says send in the clown -- how the company's new  creepy marketing ploy against McDonalds can get you a free Whopper this  Halloween.</p><p> Plus, this bar wants your dough, literally.  We've got a look at the new  Simpson-themed bar that is lighting up social media.</p><p> Meanwhile I'm live at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia this morning.  I'm gearing up to interview venture capitalist  and Founder's Fund partner, Peter Thiel coming up.  We are going to talk  with Peter Thiel about AI, about technology among other things.  He's going  to be joining me on stage momentarily and we will bring you that interview  as it happens.</p><p> The other big names I will be speaking with today Evercore CEO and  president Ralph Schlosstein is with us this morning and the President of  the New York Stock Exchange Tom Farley will join us as well.</p><p> First though, joining me from New York right now Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and telecom  reporter with the \"Wall Street Journal\" Ryan Knutson.  Good morning  everybody.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> We were just talking, if you heard us muttering about Twitter earnings.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They look better than expected, right?  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  They look good on the  surface, for sure.  You know, it should be enough -- I think the bar is set  pretty low for Twitter but we have to see what Jack says on the conference  call.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Monthly average users four million and a quarter -- Ryan  Knutson -- 330 million.  What do you think about that number?  </p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I mean that's  pretty solid, that's better certainly sequentially than they did the  quarter before but it's not quite as good as what they posted earlier this  year.</p><p> You know, obviously they're still, you know, Twitter has a lot of  engagement issues on the platform with harassment and things like that.  So  we'll see if they can address that on the call later on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What else do you want to hear on the call -- Ryan?  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Actually I'd like to hear them talk about whether or not they are  going to increase the length of a tweet from 140 characters to 280  characters.  That's been something that they've been discussing.</p><p>Twitter has been trying to innovate a little bit recently to make the  platform more user friendly because even though it has a high profile, it's  got a high-learning curve.  </p><p> MURPHY:  And Maria -- there's also talk about them -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock is up 9 percent right now -- Mike.  Go ahead.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  There's talk about them trying to monetize the platform in a  way whether he pay -- charge a small dollar amount to people to get  verified tweets or tweets from certain people.</p><p> I think if they talk about that there's a lot of upside for Twitter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's bring in Pete Pachal.  He's from Mashable Tech, the  editor of Mashable Tech.  Pete -- what are you thinking about this report?   Stock is soaring right now, up 9 percent.</p><p> PETE PACHAL, MASCHABLE TECH:  Yes.  I mean it's a solid quarter.  I mean I  think it's kind of well within sort of what we have seen Twitter sort of  blip up and blip down in the past like the revenue beat has me very curious  about how their TV sort of efforts are doing.</p><p> So like obviously Twitter has gotten into more live video, they are making  deals with sports leagues.  It's interesting, like if you look at the Web  site or the app, you would never know it, you know.  </p><p> Like they have all this video stuff going on, yet they don't really have a  landing page or a real way to discover it.  But I'm curious if any of that  is sort of contributing to this at all and what sort of long-term prospects  of that look like them for them.  And I hope Jack discusses that on the  call.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they added four million monthly users in the third quarter  to a total 330 million users.  The increase was four million users -- was  that a number that you expected, Pete?  </p><p> PACHAL:  Yes, I mean it's ok, right.  I mean they've gone like up a bit and  down a bit here and there, that's sort of well within that.  The one crazy  quarter we saw sort of the Trump-bump quarter which was like nine million a  couple of quarters ago.</p><p> But the thing is like this fixation on user growth with Twitter, I think  they are desperate to change that conversation.  I mean it's very -- pretty  apparent now that Twitter is kind of -- as big as it's about going to get  and it's going to have some steady growth.</p><p> But to me like I feel like the fundamental question with Twitter, to my  mind they have the highest rated thing on the Internet right now which is  the Trump Twitter feed.  Yet fundamentally they can't money off of it  either directly or indirectly.  And that to me kind of like just shows  there's -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PACHAL:  -- there's a fundamental problem with the service.</p><p> Now they are rethinking some fundamentals of the service like the character  count which is kind of good news but it also just shows how desperate they  are.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But here is the problem -- being a fan of -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- being a fan of President Trump or a hater of the commander in  chief doesn't tell Twitter what kind of soap you like to buy or what kind  of deodorant I use.  That's the simple problem with attaching ads to the  way people behave on Twitter.  And that goes to a core problem.</p><p> However, I will point out the fact that President Trump still uses Twitter  each and every day, it is a must-see.  It is a go-to and I would argue that  some of this user -- this quarterly user growth of four million is in part  because people have to be there if they want to stay on top of the  political news.  </p><p> PACHAL:  But they also -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  I mean it definitely -- yes.  Go ahead,  Pete.  </p><p> PACHAL:  There's a lot of -- when Trump tweets it gets all over the news.   So there's plenty of places where you can see it that are outside of  Twitter's platform so it doesn't necessarily translate into actual use or  growth or engagement.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fair enough.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Well, let me toss out this idea.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, everybody here -- so many people here  asking am I on WhatsApp.  I mean WhatsApp is used a lot here.  I feel like  everyone from CEOs to government officials are all on WhatsApp.</p><p> So I don't know what you make of that, Pete, but is that as popular today - - has that popularity growth?  </p><p> PACHAL:  Well, certainly messaging apps -- messaging apps like WhatsApp has  been a big factor in why Twitter can't grow -- right.  Because these  messaging apps are fulfilling that sort of person to person or group chat  that Twitter could have owned early in its growth.  </p><p> So like those apps which are also equally challenging to monetize in some  ways -- I mean stickers kind of seems to be one of the key things, the way  they make money.  You know, like those -- that sort of space is extremely  interesting and growing arguably even faster than Twitter.</p><p> So, you know, that's definitely a big part of the conversation, at least in  the rest of the world.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  That's also why Facebook has done -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Sure -- we'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Facebook has been so smart in its strategy to stamp out  competition by buying up these really rapidly rising companies like  WhatsApp is a good example.  Your Twitter and Snapchat, they are both  companies that are still out there trying to compete against Facebook but,  you know, they bought Instagram so that was able to head off a lot of the  growth was coming from snapchat.  So they really kind of put a ceiling it  seems on the ability for some of these companies to grow.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right -- we will leave it there.  Thanks everybody, for  that.</p><p> Pete Pachal -- great to see you, sir.</p><p> PACHAL:  You too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  And we are sorry for that little bit of a delay  there.  New York-Riyadh is a bit tough sometimes with the delay.</p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, the road to President Trump's tax  reform plan, why a GOP plan could affect your 401(k) -- that's next.  </p><p> And then a real live Simpson's bar is here just in time for Halloween, more  pictures of Moe's Tavern.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from Riyadh.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you  live from the Future Investment Initiative here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p> Saudi Aramco is weighing an initial public offering.  We are expecting an  IPO to be the largest IPO on record in 2018.  The future king Crown Prince  Mohamed bin-Salman says that the national oil giant's IPO is on track for  2018.  It could be valued at more than $2 trillion id what he's talking  about.</p><p> Joining me now -- it's going to be a $100 billion deal -- and joining me  right now to talk about it exclusively is Evercore CEO and president, Ralph  Schlosstein.  And Ralph -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> RALPH SCHLOSSTEIN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, EVERCORE:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you can only say a limited amount about this.  You've  been advising -- </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Nothing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You having been advising the Crown Prince but this is a really  important deal.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, we've been -- we don't ever talk about our clients and  it is an important deal and it's a great company.  And ultimately it's up  to the kingdom which is the sole shareholder of Saudi Aramco and Saudi  Aramco, the company to decide how to proceed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, you know, yesterday we were talking with some  sources within the kingdom who said basically they want to raise all of  this money and then use those assets to invest in Saudi Arabia because they  are doing a completely new change and a new look at developing here in  Saudi and opening up the country to foreign money.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Yes.  Well, it's interesting, if you look at this from  100,000 feet.  If you were on an investment committee for Saudi Arabia, the  first thing you would say is, you own this amazing asset, the most valuable  company in the world, but you're not diversified.</p><p> And so the economic part of this is very logical that if you are -- you own  this incredible asset, the first thing -- a hundred people out of a hundred  in finance would tell you, you should diversify your holding and invest in  a broader economy here in Saudi Arabia and also invest in broader  geographies and industries.</p><p> And at the end of the day, you know, I believe that's what's driving this  decision and it's a 100 percent sound, sounding motivated decision in my  view.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they're going to sell 5 percent of this, we think, take 5  percent of it public.</p><p> What's the impact of such a huge deal?  I mean you've been around deals and  advised on huge deals before.  When you have something as large as this, I  mean Alibaba was what -- $25 billion -- and this is going to be $100  billion.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, first of all, I think everything that's been said about  this in terms of whether it happens or not should be said by the government  and the leadership of the company -- that we have absolutely nothing to do  with.</p><p> But this is a, you know, a truly unique company.  It is truly peerless in  its industry and in all industries.  And if it were to go public, it would  be the most consequential company and the most consequential event in the  capital markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  </p><p> So it will probably be a global IPO.  We will be talking about that as more  news comes out about it.</p><p> Let me ask you about what's going on in Washington right now, Ralph,  because obviously we are waiting on a tax cut plan.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you are -- you served as the deputy to the assistant of  Secretary of the Treasury.  I want to ask you your thoughts and what you're  hearing out of the Treasury right now.</p><p> There's a story on 401(k)s today that we want to get to, do you think  they're going to be able to get a tax cut plan through?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Well, I think it's threading the needle.  I think they will  get a plan through the House and I think it will be more cut than reform  and ultimately the lack of reform will affect the amount of the cut because  there's only a certain -- I don't think this will be necessarily true in  the House because as one Republican said to me the other day, tax cutting  is what we do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so I think in the House that's the case.  In the Senate  where you have a very slim majority and a small portion of those people on  the Republican side are at least as concerned about the deficit as they are  about cutting taxes -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- I think it's going to be a little bit more challenging.   My bet would be that something makes it through.  My bet would be that it's  a little bit more on the corporate side.  I would expect and I actually  would say hope that people like -- people who are in my circumstance don't  get a tax cut at all.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> What do you think about what Kevin Brady says that many aspects of the tax  code are in play including potential changes to 401(k)s?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Look, I think there are things that could be done with  401(k)s that wouldn't be harmful.  we clearly need to encourage more  savings for retirement -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly. </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  -- in this country.  We are undersaved -- let me finish.  But  -- so for the middle-income people, we should not be cutting back on  incentives for them to save at all.</p><p> On the other hand, do I need to be able to deposit $18,000 a year tax free  or now that, you know, shocking to hear I'm 50, $24,000 a year, that's a  waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Ok.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  And so a lot of these things if you truncate them  but you  leave them in place for middle-income people, you get the benefit that they  were originally intended to accomplish and reduce their cost to the  country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So maybe that's the same approach, for example, with the state  and local?  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  I think a lot of things, if they were means tested it would  be easier to swallow.  I mean for example, I'm now sadly eligible for  social security -- I am going to wait till 70 to take it out.  But, you  know, should I be -- Do I really need to get social security benefits?  Do  I need to get them tax free?  You know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You make a good point.  That's our story earlier that they  spent a trillion dollars in social security, the Social Security  administration did this year already, at some point you have to get your  hands around spending so they are trying to thread the needle as you put  it.  </p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rob it's great to get your insights on all of this.  thank you.</p><p> SCHLOSSTEIN:  Thank you, Maria.  Good to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p> And to you.  Ralph Schlosstein joining us there from Evercore.</p><p> We'll be right back, live from Riyadh and New York this morning.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell, just sitting in  momentarily for Maria Bartiromo who is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We will  take you back there live for Maria's panel.  She'll be interviewing Peter  Thiel.  We can't wait for that.  That will happen in a matter of moments.  </p><p> Meantime, news here at home.  The trial for Garcia Zarate who was charged  in the killing of Kate Steinle, continues today in California.  Cheryl  Casone has more details.  </p><p> CASONE:  It's been jaw-dropping, Dagen.  Video that captured the moment  that Steinle was shot by Zarate triggered gasps in court yesterday from the  jury.  It showed Steinle falling, Zarate walked away and then something  splashing into the water.</p><p> Zarate who was a homeless illegal immigrant have been deported five times  and was released from jail before that shooting.</p><p> Meanwhile border wall prototypes are now finished.  A series of tests are  going to be done to see how difficult they're going to be to climb.   President Trump talking about the border wall plan in an exclusive  interview on \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\".  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs, forget even about  people.  We need a wall for drugs and the walls coming along.  We are going  to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going  to be quite the wall, it's going to be very effective.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  But Democratic lawmakers have so far shown little interest in  appropriating the estimated $21 billion it would cost to build the wall.</p><p> Well, Burger King taking a shot at arch rival McDonalds with Halloween just  a few days away.  Check out this creepy commercial.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I want my whopper.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Burger King -- they're going to offer free Whoppers first 500  people to come dressed as clowns on Halloween night.  The ad encourages  customers to quote \"Come as a clown, eat like a king.\"  The offer is going  to be available in participating restaurants from 7:00 p.m. until they  close which sometimes Dagen is 3:00 a.m.  Shares of McDonald's are sizzling  this year -- more than 34 percent.</p><p> And finally this, a bar in Chicago dressing up for Halloween where playing  Linkin Park is turning into Moe's Tavern of the Simpsons.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to get duffed?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  The owner of the bar and his wife spent hours researching the show  in order to transform the entire bar.  They are going to sell Duff's Beer.   The Simpsons, of course is owned by 21st Century Fox -- parent of the Fox  Business Network.  Another option for you on Halloween, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  I'm so on board with that, Cheryl.  Thank  you.</p><p> Moving on to Amazon -- Amazon testing out a controversial new delivery  service that's raising some eyebrows.  Are you willing to give Amazon the  keys to your home?  Tracee Carrasco has the details.  Hey -- Tracee.</p><p> TRACEY CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, you know, it comes down to  which you value more -- convenience or your privacy.  But now Amazon  testing out this new service called Amazon Key which allows couriers to  open your front door, put your package safely inside your home.  The  service uses Amazon's new cloud cam and compatible smart lock which is  $250, by the way.</p><p> Here's how it works.  You order something for delivery and click the in- home shipping option.  When the delivery driver arrives Amazon verifies the  address and deliver time and allows the driver into your home with a hand- held scanner.  You can watch the whole thing from your phone as the camera  records.  It does require an Amazon prime message and Amazon says you can  also let friends and family into your home, using it as well.</p><p> It's available starting on November 8 in 37 cities on this map on your  screen and Amazon doesn't recommend this for people with pets for obvious  reasons.</p><p> Meanwhile Amazon's dream of drone deliveries took a big step forward  yesterday.  President Trump signed an executive order that will let local  governments apply for FAA waivers to do test of delivery, drone air traffic  system and long range flights.  The administration says it wants to open  new commercial uses for the drones and create new jobs.</p><p>Amazon also reporting earnings today.  The stock is up about 30 percent  this year.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I would not do that, but just get the driver to leave it on your  stoop if you have -- </p><p> CARRASCO:  I'm ok with that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> MURPHY:  Just put them in a box and have them put it in a box with a lock  on it.  You don't need them in your house.  It could open a can of worms.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, thank you.</p><p> Although now we are concerned about privacy and we basically give to  Facebook and Google and every tech company the most intimate details of our  personal lives and then they sell them for money.</p><p> Thank you -- Tracee.  Tracee Carrasco.</p><p> Coming up the search for the next Federal Reserve chair -- why the  President's confidence in Janet Yellen may not be enough to get her a  second term.</p><p> Plus Maria Bartiromo will interview venture capitalist Peter Thiel.</p><p> The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia at 7:40 a.m. Eastern time.   Stay tuned for our live coverage of that, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo, with a special edition of  \"Mornings with Maria\" live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future  Investment Initiative.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell.  Maria Bartiromo  will be hosting a discussion shortly at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture capitalists and founder's partner,  Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October 26th.  Your stop stories at 7:30 a.m.  Eastern.</p><p> Earnings blitz on Wall Street.  Among the top names were reporting before  the bell, Twitter, Ford, UPS, and Comcast.  Twitter and Ford hitting the  tape earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both of  those companies topping expectations.</p><p>Twitter share are up eight percent.  Again, a beat on the bottom line, the  top line and a four million additional users.  Monthly average users added  in the quarter.</p><p> And it doesn't stop there.  After the bell today, we expect to hear from  Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet.  We'll bring you all the  numbers and analysis, as they come.</p><p> Futures are searching for direction this morning.  Dow Futures are up right  now though.  We have gains across the Board with a 36-point gain on the Dow  Futures.  Watching that 10-year yield with it moving up to multi month  highs yesterday, 2.44 percent is where the 10-year ended yesterday.  Higher  interest rates could hurt stocks.</p><p> Over in Europe, the markets there are moving up with gains in England,  France, and Germany.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, markets mostly higher as well.  Well, mixed markets.   The Nikkei in Japan and Shanghai were both higher.</p><p> Getting a budget done.  The house is expected to vote on the senate version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move critical for the party, as it  pushes forward with the White House is called to get tax reform passed this  year.</p><p> The latest, as a new Fox News poll shows that the majority of Americans are  upset with our current tax system.  They want it fixed.</p><p> The quest to find the next Federal Reserve chief.  While the commander-in- chief expresses support for Janet Yellen.  He says he wants to leave his  own mark.  More on the looming decision ahead.</p><p> And President Trump blasting democrats.  The president calling the funding  as a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and the DNC disgraceful while  speaking with Lou Dobbs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Don't forget, Hillary  Clinton totally denied this.  She didn't know anything.  She knew noting.   All of a sudden they found out - what I was amazed at, it's almost $6  million that they paid and it's totally discredited.  It's a total phony.   I call it fake news.  It's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why President Trump says the tables have now turned on the  party.</p><p> And turning now to the road to tax reform.  House lawmakers are voting it  today on the $4 trillion budget measure that would pave the way for tax  reform, the tax overhaul.  But house, ways, and means committee chairman,  Kevin Brady is leaving the door open to making changes to 401(k) retirement  plans under the tax bill.</p><p> Here's what the present had to say about that at the White House yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  There are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate  with.  401(k)s and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic.   But he knows how important 4o1(k)s are.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDWOWELL:  Joining us now is Trump Great America PAC co-chair.  Former  Raegan campaign manager, Mr. Ed Rollins.</p><p> ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, dear.  How are you?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One of my favorite people on planet earth.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, he should have made the game earlier last night.  I stayed  to the -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You look awesome.  I don't know what you're talking about.</p><p> ROLLINS:  All right.  Thank you.  Great game.  Great game.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about the budget.  The budget vote in the house  today.  Does it go through with flying colors?  And I want to get to that.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, it goes through with no democrat votes, so it's hard to get  flying colors and it's a 22 -vote margin that republicans have.  They  passed their own budget with 18 defections.  So I think it will pass  because republicans have decided this is so important to get and not just  the budget, but to get the tax plan and they can't get the tax plan if they  don't pass this.  So I expected to pass today without any more  modifications.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why is Kevin Brady -- why are some members of the GOP even  talking about messing with people's 401(k) contribution?</p><p> Because again, the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" says that house  republicans are still considering 401(k) changes in the tax overall,  despite what President Trump said.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, speaking of the 22-vote margin somewhat more of a fiscal  responsible bill in which it all balances out somewhat, where they cut  entitlements or a variety of things and they can't just quite get the  numbers to add up at this point in time.</p><p> So right until the final passage of this tax bill, which will come, you're  going to see this modification.  I think the original plan was to take the  state and local taxes out as a deduction and obviously as a lot of  opposition to that.  So I think to a certain extent they're -- I don't  think the 401(k)s will be said could be touched.  I think the president has  made it very clear, he does not want to do that.</p><p> An di think it's a lot of political pressure not to do that.  But I think  at the end of the day, you're going to see this back and forth until -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here is why I think that this is idiotic, stupid, moronic, I  could go on.</p><p> ROLLINS:  All of the above.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because this is supposed to be tax reform.  If you start  changing the contribution limits on these 401(k) plans and then tell  people, oh, well, then you just should go put your money in the Roth IRA.   You actually complicate their personal financial situation, rather than  make it easier.  And you also are even coming up with that much revenue if  you start tinkering with this.</p><p> Overall, this tax break, the overall retirement tax break cuts federal  revenue annually by a little more than $115 million.  So they wouldn't even  completely remove it.</p><p> So you're not even talking about that big a pool of money by changing the  401(k) plans.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, for people that are very responsible about both paying  taxes and planning on a retirement, this is a very critical part of all  this.  And as you said earlier on the show, everybody pays taxes sooner or  later.  Of course if you pay it right now, you pay it when you retire.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it's a gimmick.  It's a budget gimmick.</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's a budget gimmick.  It's totally a budget gimmick.  And a  perfect world there'd be nothing and this -- when Reagan -- which I was  part of the Reagan White House, when we passed the last tax bills, they  were just flat taxes and it was much, much simpler today.  Today it's more  complicated.</p><p> MURPHY:  It seems to me that the whole point of the tax cut is to help the  U.S. economy to help the U.S.-- the American people.</p><p> ROLLINS:  That's the promise.</p><p> MURPHY:  And to take away or reduce the 401(k), one of the biggest problems  we have is people haven't saved enough.  So anyone who thinks this should  be on the table, I'd rather see less tax cuts than taking away the 4o1(k)  plan.  I think that's a non-starter.</p><p> ROLLINS:  I think it'll be a nonstarter too.  But I'm not sitting in the  room when all this stuff is going on.  I'm like all of us here, we just  basically reading.</p><p> And I think clearly the president understands the political pressures that  these people are on and he made it very clear that he's -- including last  night with Lou Dobbs, it's not going to happen again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What I said -- I said it on Friday on Twitter.  I said it on the  news channel on Saturday.  I think what's pretty clear is you mess with  money going into the stock market, you will tank the stock market.  It's at  an all-time high and we know how important that is to the president as kind  of one a poll measure, if you will.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, equally as important.  There's a lot of people who do have  the 401(k)s and they won't quite understand why this is happening, because  there's no rational reason for it and I think to a certain extent, there'll  be a real political backlash.</p><p> The state and local taxes also has another issue, but it's not across the  country.  This is across the country.  There's a lot of people paid in to  this.  A lot of people are planning on this. And I think it just creates  confusion.  You don't need any more confusion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to -- I need to lay down.  I need to put my head down on  the desk, because you're a republican who won't fix Social Security.  They  won't even talk about it.  So you won't fix security, but that's not going  to be there because it's going broke so then you're going to hurt and  discourage people from saving in their 401(k) plans.  That is just  incredibly illogical.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, don't try and make republicans think logically or democrats  think logically.  They're part of the congress.  And the congress does not  think logically.</p><p> At this point in time, I think there is -- on the republican side, we want  to tax bill.  Have to have a tax bill.  President wants it, congress wants  it.  And I think without the democratic support, they've got to basically  paste and cut and do all those things, without doing as much damage as  possible to the constituency you're talking about.</p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, TELECOM REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Do you think  there's any odds of bipartisanship here?  Because -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  Zero.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Anytime you ever see the approval rating of congress increase is  when there's any sort of element of bipartisanship, which I think Americans  are really sick of congress not been able to get it -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  The last time -- I'd been around the game, as I've said many  times, for 50 years, last time it was bipartisanship was when I was in the  White House and you had southern democrats who then were now a republican  seats, who were more than willing to sit down and negotiate.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You had Dan -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  There's a variety and a whole variety of people.  It's just not  there anymore.  Today, it's very polarized, electing -- it's very narrow  the margins.  And 2018 is coming fast and furious.  So my sense is  democrats are hopefully going to -- from their perspective, get a majority  again, which I don't think is going to happen.</p><p> Republicans are going to hold on very -- in a hard fought battle.  And then  that's going to do basically offset that.  So it's going to be -- the  polarization is going to continue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you say the polarization, one thing we haven't even brought  up yet, the polarization within the Republican Party itself with Jeff  Flake, with Bob Corker.  There's so much anger and rage and vitriol at the  president and the president -- if these individuals who he feels like or  attacking him.  Had you ever seen anything like this, Ed?</p><p> ROLLINS:  As I said, I've been around 50 years, maybe 200 years ago we may  have something like this but -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like when Hamilton get shot?</p><p> ROLLINS:  I teach a course in the American presidency in Hofstra and this  is, as I said to my students, this is a presidency that's very unique.  It  may succeed, I think it will.  But I think at the end of the day, there's  never going to be one like it again.</p><p> MURPHY:  Shout out to Hofstra, if I may.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Good.  Great school, as you know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  John Podhoretz, in the \"New York Post.\"  I absolutely adore him.   He writes in this opinion piece.  \"Sorry, Senator Flake.  Trump is the new  normal.\"  And he's trying -- they're being told if we refuse to accept that  this is the new normal, as Flake and others are just to do, Trumpism will  eventually be expelled from the body politics.  From many of us, this is  comforting, but it's a delusion.</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's a total delusion.  I think Senator Flake -- and I preface  when I hope Kelli Ward who was running against him, she was 25 points ahead  of an incumbent senator.  So I mean he really didn't have much of a choice.   I mean, it'd be a knock down drag out race of probably losing or given up.</p><p> He clearly and the president are out on the same wavelength and I think to  a certain extent, Corker is in a similar situation.  And they move on.   It's just that's the way life is.  And I think to a certain extent, both of  those seats we can hold.  Well had to add more members and add more  members.</p><p> Critical thing republican have had the fight from the beginning, so there's  not enough republicans, there not enough minds to do all the things they  want to do.</p><p> KNUTSON:  Do you that there will be an additional senators or congressman  and woman that are going to -- in the republican side, speak out against  Trump following Flake and Corker?  Or do you think the opposite will take  backwards -- </p><p> ROLLINS:  You do so at your own peril.</p><p> MURPHY:  You don't want to lose that job.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Right.  Trump is the leader of this party.  And I think at the  end of the day, people now -- whether they like it or don't like, it's the  reality and he has a lot of supporters out there across the country.  And  especially the republican base.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ed, it's so good to see you.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Can you get back to Washington and talk some sense into those  people, please?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Well, Maria was down there and she's in Saudi Arabia today.  Lou  Dobbs is down there yesterday.  Hopefully the Fox Business influence is  going to have an impact.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You need a -- you need a nose clip to be in D.C. these days.</p><p> Thank you so much, Ed.</p><p> ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, we are waiting on our own Maria Bartiromo.  She has  an incredible interview coming up with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at  the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  We will bring you their  conversation live, next.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo, only for a few moments.  We're waiting for Maria's interview  with venture capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in  Saudi Arabia.</p><p> You're looking at the room there in Riyadh.  Maria will be taking the stage  in a matter of moment.  We will take you to that conversation as soon as it  starts happening.</p><p> But first, news here at home.  A disturbing report on what you may find in  your child's baby food.  Cheryl Casone has more.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Ye.  So, Dagen, these results are pretty  alarming.  A five-month study discovered that the majority of baby foods  sold in stores contained poisonous materials.</p><p> Researchers found that 65 percent of these foods contained detectable  levels of arsenic and more than a third tested positive for lead.  And then  there's more.  They also found the metal use in batteries in over half of  the samples that were tested.  The Clean Label Project posted a list of  those products they tested on their website.  Parents should definitely  check it out.</p><p> Well, IBM is extending its maternity leave.  The company now offering up to  20 weeks, more than four months of paid time off.  IBM also agreeing paid  parental leave for fathers should be there.  Partners and adoptive parents  also getting 12 weeks.  They used to be six weeks.</p><p> Shares of IPM -- IBM, excuse me, are down more than seven percent so far  for the year.</p><p> Well, Legoland theme park is coming to New York.  State officials  announcing that $350,000 million Legoland going to open in 2020 in Orange  County.  About 60 miles from New York City.</p><p> The theme park is going to have Lego characters and a lot of educational  programs for kids, between the ages of two and 10.</p><p> I'll show you pictures, Dagen, but they haven't built it yet, so more  later.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p> Your kids into Legos?</p><p> MURPHY:  They are, actually.  But Lego themselves -- so my kids still use  it, but Lego, the company is having a big mass exodus.  To kids going  online.  So they're trying to revive the growth there in the company.  So I  think this is what they're looking.  A lot of people moving away from  physical Lego and kids playing online games.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I understand that because the physical Lego is difficult.  When  you're close to like finishing a piece and that last one won't go in and  then everything falls apart, I recall that.  It was like childhood trauma  for me.</p><p> MURPHY:  When you build something and then your brother knocks it down on  purpose.</p><p> KNUTSON:  These are the challenges you have to deal with as a child growing  up is a development of lessons.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Crashes that with his big wheel.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you big wheels here in New York City?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stilts and trampolines.</p><p> KNUTSON:  I wonder what's that going to do to the development of kids.   Like if you're used to being in a device and screen, maybe they'll be  better computer programmers or maybe their rains will turn into mashed  potatoes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I hope not, not the former, not the latter.  But no, I think Lego  is great to help kids in so many different ways to figuring thins out  solving problems.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  And interacting in the real world with real things.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter, meeting earnings and revenue expectations  before the bell this morning.  We break down those numbers and more, next.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets out of Europe every -- news out of Europe, everybody  that could move markets here at home.  The ECB just announcing that it's  leaving interest rates unchanged for the most critical thing about this  decision is, what is the ECB doing to its bond buying program?  It is going  to royal markets?  Mike Murphy has been watching this.</p><p> So, Mike, I'm not going to stir your tongue, you tell us what you've heard  so far.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, they're going to extend the quantitative -- the bond buying  until September of 2018.  It was due to end in December of this year.  It's  going to extend nine months to September, but they're going to slow the  rate they purchase, Dagen.  It's going to go from 60 billion per month to  30 billion per month.</p><p> I think this is kind of what the market expected from them.  And I think  it's necessary because they're starting to see growth over there.  I think  they no longer needed the $60 billion.  So this is the first step to them  getting out of this process completely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it is a removal of some monetary stimulus.  And you've seen  -- particularly here in the United States, the Fed is going to begin trying  to reduce its balance sheet here in the U.S., $4.5 trillion right now.   Potentially raising interest rates again in December.</p><p> And you saw yesterday, drop in stocks.  Yields on the tenure treasury  higher at a seven months high, 2.44 percent.  So that is one major worry  for investors here is higher interest rates, less stimulus.</p><p> MURPHY:  It's a worry, yes.  But I mean, we're sitting at all-time highs on  the markets.  So I think the market here in the U.S. is telling you that,  we're OK with this.  We realize that we're no longer in these extreme  circumstances we were in back in the financial crisis.</p><p> So we're OK.  I think the Fed has done a good job in getting us off this  quantitative easing.  And I think the same can happen in Europe.</p><p> And I think also for the ECB, they have a little bit easier job because  they have the playbook here from the U.S. that's so far has worked out very  well to follow.</p><p> KNUTSON:  There just seem to be a lot of forecasting by the Fed and the ECB  of a bigger move that then get slow down and it's more gradual.  What do  you make of that?  Is that a signal that maybe the economy is -- or not as  strong as people may think?</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, that's one school of thought.  The other school of thought  is that the big problem, the big potential problem is to overdo it, is to  cut too soon and then it creates a potential catastrophe and then having to  go back into it.</p><p> So I think they're going to err on the side of caution which is what we did  here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>Twitter, meantime reporting earnings that beat estimates this morning.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.  Good morning, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So this is the  busiest day or earning season thus far.  We've had a good one with a lot of  beat.  Take a look at Twitter.  Twitter in the last few minutes went up  from eight percent to 11 percent.  So really jumping.  This is they added  more users four million in the latest quarter.</p><p> They had to restate some numbers that they overstated over the last several  quarters and years that they restated that and actually pulled back a  million users.</p><p> But big picture here it was a beat on the top and bottom line.  And they  are nearing profitability.  So Twitter up 11 percent.</p><p> Let's take a look a great American company and that is Ford.  So Ford is  trading higher this morning and it is also about that F-Series pickup.   They didn't have as much wholesale volume, but they blew out the numbers.   The stock is up one and half percent.</p><p> They also now raised the price of it is up about $2,800 to the average  price for the F-Series truck, 45,400.  They lowered their expenses for  advertising and promotion.  So Ford is a winner.  Up 1.5 percent.</p><p> Bu as I said a very busy day and we'll watch for Amazon and Google today  after the bell.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Than you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p> Coming up, we're waiting for Maria Bartiromo to take the stage with venture  capitalist, Peter Thiel at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi  Arabia.  You do not want to miss a minute of it.

I'm Dagen McDowell.   Maria Bartiromo will be hosting a discussion shortly at the future  Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Speaking with venture  capitalists and Founders Fund Partner Peter Thiel.  It's Thursday, October  26th.  And we have your top stories for you right now at 8:00 a.m.   Eastern.  And earnings extravaganza on Wall Street among the top names  reporting before the bell, Ford, UPS, and Comcast, Twitter and Ford coming  out earlier this morning.  Earnings per share and revenue for both  companies topping expectations, major moves upside on Twitter with an --  about 11 percent gain.  We're going to dig into numbers coming up in a  matter of moments.  And it doesn't stop there after the bell today we  expect to hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.  We bring  you all the numbers and analysis.  </p><p> Futures searching for -- well, they're higher this morning, 51-point gain  on the Dow futures, you can about look at bounce back in the market there.   Again, one worry yesterday, we've been talking about this morning, higher  interest rates with a 10-year yield, moving up to a seven-month high.  In  Europe, stocks are higher as well.  We have gains across the board.  ECB  keeping rates unchanged but the real news there is what is the ECB doing to  its bond-buying program.  It is reducing it, however, if you look at the  overall number, the reduction and buying next year still comes to about 450  billion euros, more than half a trillion dollar.  So stimulus still coming.   In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, Shanghai and Nikkei both up, the  Hang Seng in Hong Kong and KOSPI in South Korea closed lower.  </p><p> Budget battle brewing, the House expected to vote on the Senate's version  of a fiscal 2018 budget today.  The move is critical for the party as it  tries to push forward with the White House's call to get tax reform done  this year.  President Trump telling Lou Dobbs he expects the GOP to come  together to get it all together.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we're going to get  it.  I think the Senators are going to come together, I think the House is  looking really good, you know, that passing this bill along very rapidly, I  think that's going to happen hopefully today.  And I did make a couple  calls, I said, fellows, please no changes, just pass it along.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it doesn't look like completely smooth sailing, the growing  controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to your  401(k) retirement plan under this tax bill.  Conspiracy theorists on the  edge of their seats, the White House set to release classified documents on  the assassination of President Kennedy.  The details on what President  Trump is calling an interesting report. </p><p> Travelers taking notice.  New airport security measures on all U.S.-bound  flights going to effect today.  What you need to know before you head to  the terminal.  </p><p> Plus, at the shoe fits, the outrageous price as the most expensive high  heels in the world are unveiled.  Are they gold plated?  They sure are  ugly, we know that.  It's the busiest day meantime yet for third-quarter  earnings.  Time Warner just hitting the tape, a double beat reporting  earnings per share of $1.73, that's above expectations, also revenue of  $7.6 billion above estimates.  This as -- after Comcast reported earnings  of 52 cents a share, again, topping expectations, revenue coming in $21  billion, right in line with estimates.  And then we looked at shares of  Twitter on move up, up away they go, after the company almost -- more than  10 percent gain in premarket trading.  The company reported 10 cents a  share, that was above expectations, revenue of $590 million which also beat  expectations.  Ryan, where do you want to start? You want to start with  Twitter or you want to talk Comcast?  What is jumping out at you?  </p><p> RYAN KNUTSON, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, Twitter just real  quick, I think it's the loss of only $20 million which is far narrower than  analysts, we're expecting $80 million narrower than it was a year ago of  $100 million.  It shows that they're edging toward profitability.  They had  to restate their -- some of their subscriber or user metrics.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I noticed that but it wasn't -- I don't want to downplay that,  it was for a -- it was -- they were including users of a service for third- party apps as monthly users which they should not have counted it.   Restated users for the last three quarters, they're revised down by one  million to two million.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I don't want to dismiss that but it wasn't a giant -- </p><p> KNUTSON:  Not a huge flub, not like kind of some of the big sort of  restating we've seen some of the tech companies.  Comcast was interesting  though I thought.  They lost 125,000 video subscribers which is about what  they had forecasted earlier in the quarter, and that is a sign that cord- cutting continues to have a big impact across the industry.  The good -- on  the -- on the positive side, they had 214,000 gains in their internet  subscriber numbers.  So it shows that there's a continued move towards  cord-cutting as fewer people want to pay for the big cable bundled.  </p><p> MICHAEL MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF:  Streaming is the way of, you know, looking  how Netflix has performed, now Disney getting into that streaming is the  way we're going to consume content in the future are already.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Yes.  And it shows some of the, you know, the NBCU bet that  Comcast made a few years ago, revenue is down in that division 12 percent  but that's because they had a huge bump in the Olympics last year.  So, if  you adjust for that, it was up six percent.  So that, you know, NBCU has  better foothold in the streaming games.  So that --  </p><p> MURRAY:  Fox Business could have something to do with that also.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go Fox -- go Fox Business.  Mike, I want to ask you, we can go  micro if you want to talk about specific companies.  </p><p> MURRAY:  Let's do it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Or macro in terms of the overall earnings season.  So, what  should we look at?  I'm asking rather than telling for once in my life.  </p><p> MURRAY:  Let's start with macro.  You know, this is one of the first- quarters we've seen in a long time where the bar was set pretty high and so  it was a tough bar for companies to clear.  But a lot of companies have  been able to do it.  So it was sitting on all-time highs on the market, and  companies' earnings really needed to put up if they want to support stock  prices where they currently are.  And I think, for the most part, we've  seen -- this earnings season I would call good to very good because  companies I think have met those expectations.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming in into today, 37 percent of the S&amp;P have reported, 72  percent beating earnings per share estimates, 68 percent beating on revenue  and earnings on forecast rise seven percent which is not that double --  that double-digit number that we're talking about in the first and second  quarter but it's still solid enough to at least give this market some  balance.  </p><p> MURRAY:  For sure.  And it's enough -- if you -- look, starting with the  financials, I think financials really set this off this earnings season,  came out with good numbers, they're all trading at or near recent highs in  the financials.  And now we'll hear from tech later today to kind of  continue that trend.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing you pointed out because we're numbers nerds here that  General Motors versus Ford, Ford out with numbers earlier today that in  terms of the stock performance, huge winner for G.M. in the last year and  Ford has done nothing that make Ford a buying opportunity.  </p><p> MURRAY:  I think it does.  You know, they --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How much is G.M. up?  You told me 40 --  </p><p> MURRAY:  G.M. is up 43 percent in the year, and Ford is absolutely flat.   G.M. is now paying a 3.3 percent dividend to Ford's five percent dividend.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wow.</p><p> MURRAY:  But G.M. has really been able to deliver.  I think G.M., what  they've been able to do versus Ford is kind of get more of the technology  aspect, become cooler, have more technology tilt, focus more on the self- driving aspects so they're getting a premium to Ford's multiple.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am a big fan of the Cadillac User Interface in their  automobiles being a weekly renter of cars, so I've driven literally  everything and you are right about that.  Coming up everybody, the House is  set to vote on the measure that would pave the way for tax reform but will  the battle between the GOP and the president over 401(k)s potentially  cutting those contribution maximums.  Will that slow down historic tax  overhaul?  We got to the White House next.  Plus, Obamacare premium  skyrocketing again.  A new study finding that the most popular plans,  premiums will rise about 34 percent.  The fallout ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Turning now to Capitol Hill, it's a make-or-break day for the  GOP tax plan.  The House is set to vote on a $4 trillion budget measure  that would pave the way for a tax overhaul.  This coming as the president  and GOP continue to spar over 401(k) details under the overhaul plan.   Blake Burman live at White House with very latest.  I'm having trouble  speaking, so please take it away.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I'll take it from here,  Dagen.  It is a pretty simple road map for House Republicans, really,  Republicans in general on this one.  If House Republicans are able to pass  the Senate budget later today, then it is straight on to tax reform after  that.  This whole process is needed for Republicans, so that Senators can  eventually only need 50 votes to eventually pass tax reform.  Now, talking  with Lou Dobbs yesterday, President Trump said that he has been working the  phones.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I think the House is looking really good, you know, they are  passing this bill along very rapidly and I did make a couple calls.  I said  fellows, please, no changes, just pass it along.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  However, it remains unclear this morning if what happens today  will be a simple speed bump that Republicans will cross or if it could be a  temporary roadblock because here is the reality of it, Democrats not going  to support this, Republicans in the House can only lose 22 votes at this  point, and some Republicans are against this budget process because they do  not like the proposition of taking away the state and local tax deduction  possibly in the tax bill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PETE KING (R), NEW YORK:  I'm opposing the budget myself and I know  there is enough people out there who are opposed to the (INAUDIBLE) taking  state and local property taxes deduction away but whether or not they vote  no on the budget, I don't know.  I'm urging a no-vote on the budget.   That's the only way to stop (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Dagen, expect to be very close today on this vote but also  expected at least as of this moment that this will pass if it happens then  the details of the bill will likely come out next week.  And then one of  the big question is what happens with 401(k)s?  You remember the president  earlier this week said, 401(k)s will not be touched.  However, Kevin Brady  came out, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman yesterday saying that  this is something that is up for debate potentially.  When President Trump  was asked about that yesterday, here at the White House, he said, no, no,  no, 401(k)s aren't going to be touched, he was then told about Kevin  Brady's comments and then the president said and I quote here, \"Well, maybe  it is and maybe we'll use it as negotiating.\"  Still a lot up in the air on  this one, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Blake.  Blake Burman and I will point out,  good to see you, Blake.</p><p> BURMAN:  You too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Until this week, administration officials had declared just two  mandatory changes that the president wanted in the tax bill.  A 20 percent  corporate tax rate that was his red line, and a middle-class tax cut, but  again, you hurt the middle class, and you hurt everybody if you attack --  if you attack people's 401(k) savings.  Joining us now live from Washington  is Budget Committee Chairwoman, Tennessee Congressman, Diane Black.  Big  day on the Hill.  We're set to -- you guys are set to vote on this budget  later this morning.  Congresswoman Black, what are you expecting? </p><p> REP. DIANE BLACK (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm expecting a good vote from the House,  I'm expecting that we'll be able to move forward with the budget which  unlocks the tax reform.  It is a golden key and that means that we're going  to give relief to the middle, and the low-income taxpayers, and the -- at  least the economy will boom, we'll have more jobs, wages will go up and  this will be a great thing for the American people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What can you tell us about House Ways and Means Committee, at  least the tax-writers looking at tinkering with how much money people can  put into 401(k) plans because again that would be a rift certainly to the  investment industry, to the financial industry, to the stock market for a  certain and then also people's retirement safety.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.  Let me first of all say that it is a goal of our committee to  be sure that we enable people to be able to save as much as they possibly  can within their means for their senior years because we all know that  Medicare and Social Security are at a point we're going to have to do  something to reform them for them to even be sustainable.  So we want to  encourage people, we are looking at several different mechanisms of helping  them to get there in the best possible way, and so those are dolls that are  being turned within our committee to once again at the end of the day to  encourage people to save.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is there anything, Congresswoman, that you can talk about  specifically?  I'm -- I can kind of read into what you're saying that if  the limits on 401(k) contributions are reduced then the --  you will give  them some other mechanism to invest but again that complicates an already  extremely complicated system for socking money away in retirement trying to  use IRAs is not easy and it -- when you can do it easily at your workplace,  it is -- you just sign up and consensually forget about it except looking  for looking at your investments once a year but if you start tinkering with  this, you are messing with people's livelihoods and their retirement  safety.  </p><p> BLACK:  Well, we certainly want to be sure that people have the opportunity  to have simplicity because that was one of our goals right out the gate and  so we're going to make sure that that is the case.  And again, that we  enable people to have the best mechanism that we can give them to make sure  that they're saving for their golden years, so to speak.  </p><p> MURRAY:  So Congresswoman, when I hear about people's retirement being  potentially reduced, it seems to me that that the consequences of that  would far outweigh the benefits of the tax cut which is for growth for the  U.S., for growth for the U.S. -- for American people.  So, I mean, it seems  like it should be yes, we need the tax cuts and I support the tax cuts to  spur growth but I feel like giving in on this part of it is kind of, you  know, robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.  I think you're going to be really pleased when we come out  with our plan and we're getting ready to mark it up.  I think you will be  very pleased with where we're going.  Again, keeping our eye on the ball of  what we want to do, we want to simplify the code, we want to enable people  to be able to save and we're going to do the best mechanism that we can to  make sure that that happens.  </p><p> MURRAY:  OK.  </p><p> KNUTSON:  Congresswoman, I'm wondering there's a -- they're talking about  closing the loopholes and broadening the base in order to -- and then cut  rates.  What are some of the loopholes that might get cut from this? </p><p> BLACK:  Well, if you look at the code, there are just so many loopholes out  there, that we are -- what we really want to do, the bottom line is to make  sure that this is fair, especially for those in the middle income to a make  sure that they have more to be able to save within their home as we have  already talked about, to be able to send their children maybe to a school  of their choice, to even take a vacation.  And so, it's very important that  we simplify the code, it's 70,000 pages right now.  </p><p> And folks have a really hard time understanding even what's in the code.   Even we have a hard time understanding.  So it's simplicity that needs to  be done and that really is our goal at the end of the day, to make it as  simple as we can as a matter of fact.  95 percent of the people will be  able to fill out their tax return on a single postcard.  So getting rid of  many of those complexities, you already mentioned how many different  vehicles there are.  Even to be able to save and so let's make it concise,  let's get it down to the point, we'll make a make it very easy for  individuals to just say that's simple enough, I can understand it, that's  the product that I want to use.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman, can you say -- going back to the 401(k) issue, so  the contribution limit this year is $18,000 --  </p><p> BLACK:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- a year, 18500 next year.  Can you say definitively that the  idea that that will be cut to $2400 a year that that is off the table for  the GOP? </p><p> BLACK:  I will just say to you that that number is being looked at, and,  obviously, we are looking again at middle class making sure that the middle  income is where we give the greatest benefit to make sure that their tax  burden is reduced.  That's really where our eye is on the ball.  So looking  at those numbers that specifically target people that are in the low and  middle income and that we take care of them, because that's really the area  of our emphasis.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I can say that more than half of employees above $50.00 a  year in income would be affected by the $2400 cut off, more than half of  employees would get hit by that, if you use that number.  I want to point  that out.  </p><p> BLACK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  </p><p> BLACK:  You're very welcome.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Diane Black.  Take care.  New security changes for  travelers including Americans flying into the U.S.  What you need to know  before you head to the airport.  Plus, would you really let these shoes  touch the ground?  Coveted jewels and held together with gold thread?  We  will tell you the jaw-dropping number.  That's ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria right now.</p><p> PETER THIEL, FOUNDERS FUND PARTNER:  Well, I think investing in the  technology space, entrepreneur, and investor for the last 20 years in  Silicon Valley and within the area of I.T., it has for the last 10, 15  years in the U.S. and -- in the world been extremely centered on Silicon  Valley.  I think -- I think that there's sort of a lot of reasons for that  but the -- but the question is, where is the growth going to happen in the  next 10 years.  And what I would tend to think is that it will be more  diversified from just Silicon Valley that -- it was -- it was something  very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley because off after  these internet companies are global in scope, they can be built anywhere,  there must be some talented people, some capital -- the right government  structures.  </p><p> And so always as very odd question why all the companies of this new global  technology were built in one specific place called Silicon Valley.  And I  think the answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and  role models, but I think at this point I would bet on places outside of --  outside of Silicon Valley.  The one big place outside of Silicon Valley  over the few years has been China where there have been some, you know,  spectacular companies started.  And I think the question is where else one  might look and it -- there is a single other place, it's not a specific  city or a specific country but I think in general there is a much  opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.  </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  I'm going to talk to you about really  industries and sectors that you find interesting because when you first  founded PayPal, we were in a different time, today, we're talking about  data, we're talking about the cloud, we're talking about digitizing our  life and technology is underpinning of every industry whether it's  driverless cars or collecting data, so zeroing first on industries, where  are you finding opportunity to invest in industry? </p><p> THIEL:  I'm always -- I'm always uncomfortable with the theme question.  So  I think there are all sorts of trends in technology and I'd be happy to  talk about them.  I think they're often difficult as a venture capital  investor.  So the trends are off from the buzzwords, so the buzzwords like  software, cloud computing, big data, virtual -- the augmented reality,  artificial intelligence.  We've all heard these buzzwords and even though  these trends may or may not happen as investments they're often very  dangerous.  And you hear these buzzwords, you often suggest runaway as fast  you can because it's often an indication that the specifics have not been  talked through carefully enough.  </p><p> And so what I think -- what I think of investing in is never invest in  trends or things like that but always invest in specific companies.  And  what I -- what I try to find are unique companies that are doing something  that can't be done, you know, anywhere else.  And where it's, you know,  this is sort of a one of a kind in the world and whereas it's trend, there  are many of that kind which means there are many competitors and they're  somewhat undifferentiated.  And so --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a fair point.  Can you give us some examples?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, certainly, you know , and -- for example Airbnb, SpaceX,  Facebook earlier on were, you know, investments I made and each of these  company you can describe them as part of the trend, the sharing economy, or  social networking for Facebook BURMAN:  that's a misleading way to describe  it, it was much better to think (INAUDIBLE) solving a very specific  problem.  So Airbnb was sort of a hotel room substitute.  It's not the  sharing economy obstruction, it's the hotel room substitute, the only one  company that's doing that on a worldwide scale and that makes it a one of a  kind company.  Facebook somehow configured out real identify.  There are a  lot of people doing social networking in one form or another, Facebook was,  you know, is the one company that really cracked real identity.  People are  not interested in networking.  You know, one of my friends started a  company in 1997, Reid Hoffman, started LinkedIn.</p><p> Seven years before Facebook, and the company was called social net.  They  had social networking in the name of the company seven years before  Facebook and they wanted to abstract networking and virtual cyberspace and  some people would pretend they were dogs and other people would pretend  they were cats, and you had these virtual dogs and virtual cats talking to  one another, turned out, no, that's not what people are interested in.   They're not interested in abstract networking, they're interested in real  identity.</p><p> And Facebook cracked -- was the first one to crack that and that's  something that -- so it's often -- it's often even defining what these  companies are doing, correctly so that you can identify what the one-of-a- kind things are.  But I always prefer, you know, a bottom-up approach, you  meet with, you know, the entrepreneurs, you meet -- you try to think hard  about the technology, about the business opportunity and then it's the ones  that are different that don't fit into any good categories that are the get  a ones.  And that's something like that that's been (INAUDIBLE) and then  when we've invested which we've o occasionally gone that's often been much  more treacherous.  Even if the trend happens, you know, it means you  glossed over details of the specific technology, the specific business and  you've extracted a way too many of the important details.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it's a really smart approach that you bring up.  I want to  ask you about Artificial Intelligence and the risk of it but before I go  there, let me come at that question a different way.  You said we are  addressing problems, what are that problems in the world that you see today  that perhaps you can come up with solutions for? </p><p> THEIL:  Well, that's -- if I -- if I -- if I already -- if I already knew  the answer to that I would have started the company and on -- there are --  there are lot of -- there are lot of problems that I find myself very  passionate about, you know, the area that -- one area that we've done a  fair bit in for Silicon Valley Venture Firm is biotech investing, you know,  there are questions, could we really do things to cure cancer, could he  find cures for Alzheimer's, for other diseases and I think -- I think it's  been a very challenging area to invest in, but it's one where there is sort  of -- there's obviously some very natural set of problems that we should be  working against.  </p><p> And I think that the fact that progresses many of these places have been so  slow and so difficult is not just a law of nature, it's not the fact --  it's that we have often not been trying the right way, we're not funding  the right scientists.  And so I think that's a -- that's a place where I  often think there's very good opportunities and it can also make the world  a much better place.  So biotech is something I think is naturally  charismatic in that -- in that way.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And technology has enabled so much in biotech.  We're living  longer, and now we have this whole theme of sensors, I mean, there is a  sense in your bloodstream and your phone can call you up and say, you're  arteries are clogged, you need to go to the doctor, you're going to have a  heart attack.  So what is technology doing to enable longevity and to  actually move the needle on biotech? </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- there -- again, it's -- there are sorts of -- the  abstract ways of talking about in terms of, you know, bioinformatics or  genomics.  The specific applications are always, you know, very -- one  company we were investing was company called Stemcentrx, they had developed  -- they were using some technology that have fury but then they also had a  technology to find better targets for a subset of cancer cells.  </p><p> So it was an anti-cancer cell, they pump -- they notify pumps and targets  and then we're developing, you know, a whole series of different ways to  target and it was sort of acquired by (INAUDIBLE) about six to 10 billion,  sort of, earn-out built in that couple years ago.  So there are -- it's  always like a very specific story like that.  People are trying to solve.   You know, what motivates the great entrepreneurs just to be working on an  important problem and there's a counterfactual sense of agency.  If you  weren't working on it, the problem is not getting solved.  So it's not --  so it is a problem that everyone knows about or everybody is working on,  you know, not -- that already a little bit more --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Than you missed the opportunity.  </p><p> THEIL:  -- in education, or health care.  That's a little too abstract.  We  all know those are problems, it's the specificity that I think matters.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about -- </p><p> THEIL:  Yes.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, please.</p><p> THEIL:  No.  Go ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One theme that we've been talking about, of course here, is  what His Highness is doing with NEOM and all the technology that is going  to be in this new city of the future.  Where do you see the opportunities  in terms of starting from scratch?  When you have a city what kind of  technologies are going to be most needed?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- there is a tremendous amount that one can do when one  starts something new from scratch because one thing that's very striking  about the great cities of the world, like ones in New York, you know,  Silicon Valley, very -- many other places is that even though there are  these incredibly dynamic economic places, it's extremely hard to change  things.  And so, you know, New York City costs a billion dollars to build  one mile of subway or something like that.  In San Francisco, you can't --  you can't build new highways or anything new.  The transportation grid is  set.  And so there is -- there is this very weird transportation problem  with the big cities where in effect becomes incredibly hard to build new  transportation once the basic city has been built if the transportation  systems are inadequate and I would say they are badly inadequate in all of  our major cities.  </p><p> Even in developed world, emerging world the catastrophic, developed world,  they're generally inadequate.  It ends up meaning that people have either  super long commutes or they need to live in small apartments near the city  center where they have to spend all their salaries on the apartments.  And  so, I think it distorts the economics in these cities to a tremendous  degree.  In London, the inelasticity of housing in London is minus two  which means if you built one percent more housing in London, the price --  the average price, the average house would go down by two percent which is  a crazy economic reality.  So the more housing you build in London, the  less the housing is collectively worth.  </p><p> And that tells you that it's -- and that's because transportation systems  are in 19th century and it's completely -- it's completely stuck and that's  a challenge that I think you could, you know, rethink in a very exciting  way.  And so I wondered if one -- if one could do something we could build  a potentially enormous city but one where the transportation works at every  level.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  So, transportation we've been hearing a  lot about obviously, with ride-sharing companies like in Uber, like a Lyft.   What is your take on what transportation will look like in the future, will  it be ride-sharing?  Will we have automated and autonomous and driverless  cars?  What is your vision in terms of transportation and how it changes  for big cities?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well I think all these things are -- all these things are gradually  approaching.  It's certainly just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft  which I'm invested in, it is a -- it itself a very big change.  The self- driving car trend, it's -- again, it's a trend, it's very important trend  for the economy, for change consumer behave tremendously if you have self- driving cars maybe you could have a longer commute because you could work  in the car or, you know, maybe some things -- some things would change.   I'm not sure it's a good investment because there are a lot of companies  doing similar technologies and self-driving cars.  It's hard to know  exactly how the differentiated they are.  The transportation-related  technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars though is there  some way to do an end-run around our broken transportation systems.  </p><p> And the I.T. (INAUDIBLE) that people have talked about for decades is  telecommuting.  And, so would there be some way to -- so that you won't  need transportation at all and you can just do your work remotely?  And  this is -- and for a variety of reasons this has not worked for the last,  you know, 30, 40 years and people have been talking about it.  But the  problem generally is that people work from their homes, they don't work as  hard, they don't have any, you know, and there's a lot of value of work  comes from talking to people and various ways.  But I think we're starting  to see more and more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley, and  elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of  Silicon Valley, their ways to sort of bundle and put the work in certain  packages that you allocate to different people.  </p><p> And so I think maybe one of the -- one of the end runs around the tech --  the transportation system will be telecommuting.  I think that's one that  would be -- that's a trend that's underrated that's worth exploring a lot  more.  It's not -- so you can always -- you can look at trends that are not  on anybody's radar.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter, let's talk Artificial Intelligence.  We've talked a lot  about it this week and people are worried that the more A.I. and machine  learning you have in a situation, the fewer jobs you have.  So are robots  going to be taking our jobs?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, it's -- one of the things, you know, I'm always nervous about  the abstractions.  A.I. is one of the greatest abstractions of all because  Artificial Intelligence can mean the next generation of computers or the  last generation of computers or anything in between.  So it can mean things  that are -- like a little bit in the future, or in a very far in the  future.  If you have generalized Artificial Intelligence, the sort of where  you had computers that was smarter and more able as you in every way  possible, I would say that the problem with that is not economic but  political -- it would be like an alien from another planet landing and the  question if aliens land on earth would not be, what does this mean for the4  unemployment rate?  The question would be, are they friendly, are they  unfriendly, things like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p> THEIL:  And so -- and so I think to the extent the economic question  serious it's much more a political question.  Now, the history of course of  technology has not been one of pure substitution.  It's been more  complimentary that as we've automated things in the industrial revolution.   You know, it's freed people up to be more efficient and to do other things,  and hasn't, you know, people are still mostly employed in our society just  as they were mostly employed 200 years ago, it's just -- but not all in  agriculture, not all working in factories.  You know, as this -- as  agriculture and industry were automated as you have robots replaced humans  in factories, it freed people up to do other things.  </p><p> And so that's been the history.  And I tend to think that's still what will  happen at A.I., you know, it will -- it will make certain sectors more  efficient and then it will free people up to do other things.  So, it's  mainly a cop game of complimentary.  If it comes a game of substitution,  only at the end if you have an A.I. that can do everything better, smarter,  and cheaper than any human being.  And then that would be very scary and  that's where my intuitions would start to break down.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you think the skill sets are that people need to not  just survive but drive in this new world of machine learning?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, you know, it's always -- I always get asked these questions  by young people with, you know, which -- that'd be studying.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Would be studying, right.</p><p> THEIL:  And I think -- I think, you know, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to  give general answers but I think it's always good to start with things  where you're not competing directly with computers, where you have -- where  you still maybe have some real skill where you're thinking very hard about  -- the future about your place in it, and so you should -- you should be  asking critical questions.  And the default of our colleges in our school  systems is to tell people that they don't need to ask those questions.  If  you get a college diploma you will be saved, everything will be fine, and I  think that's not true.  And so I think, you know, this is very difficult.   I think people should be asking these questions much earlier because the  universities do not have an answer.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you say some -- when you don't -- something that you don't  compete with a computer, I feel like I'm competing with a computer on  everything.  Are you talking about emotional things?  </p><p> THEIL:  I mean, Maria, you're in one of the safest positions possible.   You're not -- you're not competing with the computers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> THEIL:  You know, if we got a computer that looks just like you, that could  do your job as well as you could, I mean, everybody in this room, we have  business mobile for you.  So you are the last person in this entire room  that has to compete with a computer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Listen, I want to ask you about cybersecurity.   Palantir obviously has incredible relationships across the world, with  governments and you've done a lot of work on cybersecurity.  Talk to us  about how significant an issue this is, where the bad actors are, what can  we do to protect ourselves in this new world where we feel like everyone is  getting hacked, and data has become so much more powerful.  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, there's a -- there's a tremendous amount that we can do in  combining computers with humans.  And, you know, a lot of the approaches in  crime defense, areas like this, has been security, have been -- we either  have all human solutions or all computer solutions.  And I think the truth  is that there is a lot to be done with this intermediate hybrid solutions.   And what we did at PayPal and what we've done with Palantir is figure out a  good division of labor between human analysts and automated computer  systems and it turns out that if you get the division of labor right you  can do a lot.  You know, it's -- we had fraud at PayPal on DACA a while.   We had a human team and it was like looking for needles in a haystack,  millions of transactions couldn't possibly figure out which ones were  fraudulent.  </p><p> The all-computer model didn't work either because the fraud patterns would  change and computer wouldn't actually -- wouldn't really figure out the new  ones.  It was when we figured out a way to divide the labor between the  human investigators and the automated computer parts that we really got a  handle on it.  And so I think this hybrid human-computer synergy theme is  under -- it's underrated because we either want total automation or no  computers at all needs and I think the in-between thing needs to be  explored a lot more and that's what Palantir among others has done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are the bad actors trying to hack information on obvious group?   Where are they?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, I don't think -- I don't think it's -- I don't think it's an  obvious group.  We would have obvious -- we would have probably tracked  them down.  One of the challenges with cybersecurity is that it's -- there  is something about it where it's -- where it's very asymmetric that, you  know, in most forms of defense military technologies, the defends side is  pretty good but in cybersecurity, it's very hard to defend, it's very easy  to attack.  And so if you have something where it's incredibly easy to  attack, incredibly hard to defend, that creates some very unusual  challenges.  And I think -- I think we haven't quite figured out what to do  about them, we certainly are not able to defend as well as we can, we're  not willing to take the precautions that are needed.  And it really calls  out for some big -- a lot more work in the decade ahead.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been -- </p><p> THEIL:  But I think people's intuitions are shaped by their everyday  experience where there is more of a balance between attack and defense.   The world of cyber, there is no balance at all.  Its attack is super easy,  defense is super hard.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been really successful in terms of watching where the  growth is in the world and identifying the companies that are, you know,  solving important problems.  What excites you right now?  What can you look  at in the world today that you feel like, wow, that is a good idea or that  is really where the growth story is?  </p><p> THEIL:  I'm always nervous about being excited about things because it  always feels too rationally exuberant and too emotional and --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Like 1999.  </p><p> THEIL:  Yes.  So I went through '99, so a lot of people are very excited  and that was dangerous.  But if you ask what are the things where there's,  you know, what's very charismatic and the people are not paying enough  attention to, I think there are these pockets and biotech that I find like  that.  You know, the one other one that I've been looking at a lot more  have been the cryptocurrencies and one skeptical of most of them, I do  think people are a little bit -- are maybe underestimating Bitcoin  specifically because it is like -- it's like a reserved form of money, it's  like gold and it's just a store of  value.  </p><p> You don't actually need to use to make payments and it's been, you know,  there's about $70 billion worth of Bitcoin in the world, there's nine  trillion worth of gold.  And if Bitcoin ends up being the cyberequivalent  of gold, it has a -- it has a -- it has a great potential left.  So that's  -- and it's a very different kind of thing from what people in -- people in  Silicon Valley normally focus on companies, not, you know, algorithms or  protocols but to -- this may be -- this may be one exception that's very  underestimated.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will people question it and I know there has been much debate  about Bitcoin but they question it because what is it based on.  I mean,  you see that the dollar is based on, you know, the trust of the treasury,  the trust of U.S. government.  What is Bitcoin based on?  </p><p> THEIL:  Well, you know, it's based on the security of the math which tells  you that it can never be -- it can never be diluted by government.  It can  never -- it can never be -- it can't be hacked and it's a form of money  that's absolutely -- that's secure in an absolute way.  And, of course, you  could ask the same question about gold.  That's why I use the gold analogy,  say, what is gold based on, why is gold valuable?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Yes.  Well, it's a tangible asset, gold.</p><p> THEIL:  It's a tangible asset, but it's also hard to mine.  If it was easy  to mine gold then it wouldn't be that valuable, so you would just have way  more gold.  So, Bitcoin is also it's mineable like gold, it's hard to mine,  it's actually harder to mine than gold, and so in that sense, it's more  constrained, and so, yes, there are a number of things that I think make it  somewhat similar to gold, and then the question is just, does this become - - does this become more widely -- more widely used.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's anonymous, right?  I mean, that's one of the beauties  of it.  You can be anonymous using Bitcoin.</p><p> THEIL:  Yes, it's half anonymous, half not.  So, it's -- again, this  intermediate thing is a question whether that's right or not but it's a  bearer instrument, so if you -- if you have the Bitcoin, if you know the  key, you can -- you can go anywhere most of the time most securities are  registered, not bearer security, so it's a very unusual kind of a security.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter Theil, thanks so much for your insights today.</p><p> THEIL:  Awesome.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Peter Thiel.  Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was our very own Maria Bartiromo at the Future Investment  Initiative interviewing Peter Thiel Bitcoin more constrained than gold is  one comment from Peter Thiel in Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> Earlier this morning, Maria interviewed SoftBank's investment adviser CEO,  Rajeev Misra, and discussed the company's current dealings with Uber.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's happening with Uber right now?  I know they wanted $10  billion from you?</p><p> RAJEEV MISRA, INVESTMENT ADVISER, SOFTBANK:  No, Uber is not looking to  take 10 billion from us.  They will get 1 billion or 1-1/2 billion as  primary investment.  There is potentially an opportunity to provide  liquidity to shareholder and employees who are early investors to sell  secondary shares to SoftBank, and we are in late-stage discussions to  potentially buy some secondary shares from early investors.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maria also got his take on Alibaba and finding value in these  markets.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obviously, Alibaba has been an incredible performer for you.   But when you look elsewhere, is there another Alibaba out there?</p><p> MISRA:  They may not be Alibabas but we make thousand times the return, but  we invested in Nvidia nine months ago.  We bought five percent of Nvidia,  it was close to $3 billion.  It's worth 6 billion in nine months.  So, you  don't have to find just Alibabas to make good investments. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike Murphy, I want to get your reaction to both of those  comments from Rajeev.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, the Uber is really interesting, because, you know, so many  people are talking about when is Uber going to go public?  They have to go  public.  Well, he talks about giving the company 1 billion to 1-1/2  billion, and taking existing shareholders and employees out of their  stocks, so tendering stock from people who currently own it.  Sounds like  kind of a public-type transaction where without going public.  So, I think  that's really interesting and could be the future for Unicorns.  If you  have these large like SoftBank raising another $100 billion funds now.  If  they're looking to go out to Unicorns, provide liquidity to people, that  will 100 percent give Unicorns less reasons to go public.</p><p> KNUTSON:  And it will take a lot of pressure off of those companies, too,  because as you see when they have an IPO, suddenly they're out in the open,  you can see how much money they're losing like we've seen with Snap.  It  might, in Uber's case, take a lot of pressure off of them so they can try  to turn the company around and get their culture in place without having to  have the spotlight of the public markets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they've got a -- they still have a fairly long road to go on  that.  Meantime, pretty busy morning for earnings, but is Washington really  driving the market?  Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Mr.  Stuart Varney.  What say you, Mr. Varney?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  What say I?  I'd be intrigued  to hear Mike Murphy's Unicorn hunting stories.  I wonder if he's ever come  across a stock that he invest 3 billion into and nine months later, it's  worth 6 billion.  Just asking, Mike.  Just asking.</p><p> MURPHY:  I haven't yet, but if I do, Stuart, I'm calling you first.</p><p> VARNEY:  You're a good man.  I don't care what they say.  All right.   Onward and upward, I've been watching these earnings reports that's coming  out this morning.  Overall, they look pretty good, in line, with the pretty  good report that we've seen so far.  That's why this market is up 61  points, the Dow is going higher first thing this morning.  I'm paying  attention more closely to the budget vote.  I expect it to be a \"yes\".  If  it's a \"no,\" catastrophe.  I'm paying attention to tonight, Amazon, Google,  Microsoft, 4:00, they get their results out there.  I think that's  absolutely crucial to the future of the market because if any of them  disappoints significantly, I think we've got a real problem here.  So, it's  a real high-stakes game today with the budget and the big techs, but so  far, so good, we open higher.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Make it happen, Stuart.</p><p> VARNEY:  Moi?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  Talk to Murphy.  He's the one who makes things happen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oui, oui, Stuart, toi.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL: Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Monday through Friday.  You can't  miss him, not one minute of it in less than 10 minutes.  9:00 a.m. Eastern,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A well-known political analyst at NBC accused of sexual  harassment.  Cheryl Casone has more on this.  Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  And there's been some new developments in the story, Dagen.  NBC  has now suspended political analyst Mark Halperin, following accusations of  sexual harassment.  A number of women talked to CNN about alleged lewd  behave from Halperin who co-authored the book, \"Game Change.\"  In a  statement, Halperin says he pursued relationships with younger woman and he  apologizes.  Here is the statement, this is what he said, \"During this  period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including  some junior to me.  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior  was inappropriate and caused others pain.\"  So, we're just getting that  statement in, and he continues to say, \"For that, I am deeply sorry and I  apologize under the circumstance, I'm going to take a step back from my  day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"  So, again,  Mark Halperin has been suspended from NBC and MSNBC as well.</p><p> Well, talks between the Weinstein Company, Colony Capital have stumbled and  the troubled studio may seek some other bidders.  The Wall Street Journal  reporting price is the main issue now despite its value falling sharply in  the wake of the scandal, the board of the company is seeking more than  Colony is willing to pay right now, Dagen.  So those are a couple headlines  we're following for you this morning.  Back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  And let's get right back to Maria Bartiromo  at The Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.  There's so much to  cover from what you experienced in the last few days, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right, Dagen.  And you know, I guess my big -- sort of,  my big feeling or thought here is the fact that there is something going on  here that it feels like seismic.  I mean, there's a change in culture, the  Crown Prince, who of course, is the future king has drawn line in the sand  and basically said, look, we want to open this country, we want -- we want  to live normal lives.  You know, he was talking the other day onstage  basically saying, we used to live normal lines before 1979 when Iran really  took over.  And I think that's why the Saudis and the U.S. have become  friendly, and are aligned because their common enemy is Iran.</p><p> And so, I think that the Crown Prince recognizes that the world is looking  at Saudi Arabia differently than he sees it, and skeptically, frankly,  obviously.  And so, he's trying to change that perception.  We'll see if it  works.  There is some pushback to his plans.  They're saying, look, he's  moving way you too fast, some people don't want to change, they want to  have women covered up, they want this -- their history to continue, he  doesn't.  He's 32 years old, he's the future king, and he's trying to make  tremendous change.  That was one thought here.</p><p> The other thought is the fact that they are using technology in incredible  ways, they want autonomous cars, they want machine learning, they are  putting all of the things that we talked about every day into practice  here.  So, we'll see, it's an experiment.  We'll obviously be watching it,  Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It really -- and I think the attendance there and the biggest  names in investing, the heaviest hitters from around the globe, the fact  that they are there kind of also spotlights on change that's happening.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And, of course, there's Saudi Aramco deal.  It's  going to be the largest IPO ever.  It's going to be a $100-billion deal.   Just to put that in perspective, Alibaba was the biggest, that was 25  billion.  Saudi Aramco is going to be 100 billion, so that's why you see  all of these private equity guys and investors.  They want a piece of that  action.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, live from Riyadh and  New York.  Stay with Fox Business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That'll do it for us from Saudi Arabia.  My thanks to Mike  Murphy, Ryan Knutson, Dagen McDowell, we'll see you tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, come back soon, Maria, we miss you.  (INAUDIBLE) were here.   All right.  Now --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm on my way.  Thanks, Stu.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is Thursday, October 26th. Thanks so much for joining us, happy Thursday. Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An earnings extravaganza today in business, among the top names reporting before the bell, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast. It does not stop there, we got a big night tonight. We are expected to hear from Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet parent of Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course tech stocks have been trading down ahead of these numbers, we will have all of the numbers and analysis as they hit the tapes. Stay with us on this, that will likely set the tone for markets.</p><p>Take a look at Futures right now ahead of all of that, unchanged on the DOW Jones Industrial Average, very fractional moves for the S&amp;P500 down not even a point. Nasdaq Composite up not even a point.</p><p>Checking the action in Europe this morning, stocks are higher in the European zone. FTSE100 up a third of a percent as the CAC Krones is in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany as well up about 38 points in Germany.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher, take a look at the indices there with the exception of Hong Kong and Korea. The Shanghai Composite was up a third of a percent, Nikkei Average also squeaking out a gain.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the U.S., budget battle is brewing. The House expected to vote on the Senate's version of the fiscal 2018 budget later today. This move is critical as you know for the party as they move forward what the White House's call to get tax reform passed this year.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>telling Lou Dobbs last night he expects the GOP to come together to get this passed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well I think we're going to get it. I think the senators are going to come together, I think the House is looking really good. They're passing this bill along very rapidly.</p><p>In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today and I did make a couple of calls. I said, \"Fellows, please no changes. Just pass it along.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It may not be all smooth sailing though after all the growing controversy as lawmakers leave the door open to making changes to 401K retirement plans included in the tax bill. We're also taking a look at the deductions and the fight going on there.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>blasting the democrats meanwhile, the commander-in-chief calling the funding of a dirty dossier by the Clinton campaign and DNC \"disgraceful.\" Why he says the tables have now turned on the dems.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"NBC News\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations. The details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against him.</p><p>Travelers take notice, a new airport security measure is insight on all U.S. bound flight that's going into effect. One airline is making it a little easier though for you to fly. What you need to know before headed to the terminal coming up this morning.</p><p>I'm live here once again at day three of the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning. We got a big panel coming up. I will be sitting down with Peter Thiel, founder of Palantier, the technology firm.</p><p>We're going to ask Peter Thiel about AI, about technology. It's another big day of exclusive news making interviews right here on the program. Among the big names I'll be speaking with, Venture Capitalist as I mentioned, Peter Thiel.</p><p>Plus, DOW Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris is with us this morning. Bechtel Group CEO, Brendan Bechtel is here. And the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein is with us. And the New York Stock Exchange President, Tom Farley as we all look to that Saudi Aramco deal with so many Wall Street want a piece of that action.</p><p>We'll talk about all of that coming up. Joining me from New York this morning, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner, Mike Murphy. And \"The Wall Street Journal's Telecom\" Reporter this morning, Ryan Knutson with us. Good morning everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER: Good morning. Nice to see you. How's the weather over there?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, look, I want to talk about tech. The weather is gorgeous, it feels like it's all -- it's summer all the time actually. So it's pretty warm here.</p><p>But technology has not been warm, you know that. These stocks have been trading down going into this earnings period Mike. What do you think about the fact that Amazon has rolled over, Google parent Alphabet, are the expectations coming down for these tech names?</p><p>MURPHY: I don't really think so Maria. So I see it more as a basing pattern. They had these huge run ups in the first six to nine months of the year where they were up 30 percent roughly a lot of the names.</p><p>So they've had this kind of basing or even a pullback of five percent. I'm really looking forward to these earnings because I think if they continue the momentum they had these stocks are going to move to new highs.</p><p>RYAN KNUTSON, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S TELECOM REPORTER: There's also a little bit more concern --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think Ryan?</p><p>KNUTSON: There's also a little bit more regulatory concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, sorry.</p><p>KNUTSON: I mean we've got an administration now that is being a lot tougher on Amazon and all the pressure that they're under from a lot of the fake accounts and Russia's ability to buy ads on these platforms and there's a lot of scrutiny in Washington over these companies that might create some long-term pressure for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: May I add one thing Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually yes. Yes, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of pressure from Washington, again, Kevin Brady Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, they're writing this tax bill trying to put it together.</p><p>Front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today that House republicans are still considering 401K plan changes in this tax overhaul despite what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said on Twitter on Monday. I just think that this is one of the most moronic things as an investor, as a saver, as an American taxpayer that I've ever heard come out of Washington and that's saying a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the point Dagen? I mean is it significant money that they're trying to save? I know every penny counts here given the $20 trillion debt that we're talking about and getting our arms around spending.</p><p>What is the point of making changes to 401K at the time that most Americans have no savings?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that it's raising -- it's a way to raise revenue in this tax overhaul. I think that some of these republicans believe that it will go unnoticed. Well I think the financial markets will not ignore it and it could cause a market crash, that's my thinking on this.</p><p>But there's a lot of data on how many people actually if they cut that $18,000 limit which is this year to say $2,400 maximum contribution of 401K plan, more than half of employees making more than $50,000 a year would be affected by that $2,400 cutoff, more than half.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are not going to save as much, they won't be able to. And obviously they're not getting the match from their company. And we know that very -- I mean, a small percentage of people actually have the appropriate money saved for retirement which is one of the earliest lessons learned in business and investments that you have to have a nest egg for retirement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. I know that you're hot on this because you are a saver, saver, saver.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I am. And 401K included. But so are you. The two of us have that same mentality. Yes. We'll see how this plays out and we'll talk about it today with all of our guests because this is really important and it affects a lot of people.</p><p>It's also obviously the busiest day yet for third quarter earnings, let's get into that Dagen because we're waiting to hear from Comcast any moment. Expectations for the third quarter, $0.51 a share, revenue expected at $21 billion.</p><p>As we also await Twitter, the company is expected to report its third quarter earnings in the next hour as soon as these numbers come out. Obviously we're going to bring them to you. Analyst expect the social media company to report earnings of $0.06 a share on revenue of $586.7 million.</p><p>So Ryan, let's get into this here, what are you expecting when Twitter reports what should we be looking at in terms of what's most important here?</p><p>KNUTSON: Well subscriber growth is always a really key metric for Twitter. They had a huge bump after the election. There was nine million subscribers were added in the first quarter and then it was flat the quarter after that.</p><p>So -- and there's various expectations about whether there's going to be a million or maybe four million subscribers on Twitter. But one of the things here is that they haven't really been able to prove that they can make money.</p><p>If they come in at what analysts are expecting for revenue, that would be the third straight year-over-year decline in revenue for this company. They have huge engagement on the platform, it's obviously hugely important in American Fabric of Society.</p><p>You've got the president making huge re-important statements on here and that they haven't really been able to figure out how to turn a significant profit. One thing that's sort of interesting is that Square, the other company that Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is the CEO of is on pace to surpass Twitter in market value especially if Twitter has a rough day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's interesting. Meanwhile Microsoft -- I mean probably going to see a bigger impact on markets from Microsoft and from Alphabet, right?</p><p>I mean, Mike Murphy, do you expect that that's going to impact the broader markets, what we see from Microsoft and Google?</p><p>MURPHY: For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Amazon obviously.</p><p>MURPHY: Absolutely. These are the names where you've been able to invest for growth and this is where all of the big funds are heavily invested in these names.</p><p>So highly unlikely a Twitter could come in and surprise the markets for the downside. I see that's highly unlikely Amazon or Google or Microsoft disappoints the market in a big way. I think these guys are hitting on all cylinders right now.</p><p>So I expect strong quarters from all of the big tech and I think as I said earlier, I think they start to move to new highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, these stocks are trading up fractionally this morning. In the premarket, those companies reporting after the bell tonight.</p><p>Back in Washington Dagen, House republicans have these tax reform squarely in their sight. The Chamber set to vote today on that $4 trillion budget measure. That, of course, paves the way for tax reform but the House's top tax writer, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady says he's leaving the door open to making those changes to the 401K retirement plan.</p><p>Listen to what the president has to say about this at the White House. We've got to continue this conversation, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: 401Ks to me very important and they're important because that's one of the great benefits to the middle class. I didn't want that to go too far that's why I ended it very quickly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kevin Brady who was the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said this morning it could be on the table.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, maybe it is and maybe we'll use that as negotiating but I trust -- trust me, that's one of the great things. You know, there are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with.</p><p>401Ks and Kevin knows it and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic but he knows how important 401Ks are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is it on the table or off the table Dagen? I mean he said it was on -- off the table and then he said well maybe it's on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's still up for discussion because it said -- \"The Wall Street Journal\" has a great story on this that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>seem to surprise lawmakers on Monday by ruling out 401K changes that were discussed in the news over the weekend.</p><p>We've hammered this since it was even floated on Friday afternoon. But it is still up for discussion. But I'm just baffled by this because, again, it's an easy way to raise money right now because these are pre-taxed contributions.</p><p>Essentially, it opens the pool to more money to be taxed by the federal government by limiting the amount you can contribute to a 401K plan. But I want to remind everybody, we still pay tax on that 401K money when it comes out at retirement.</p><p>It's not like this money is untaxed. And I think that we -- the financial industry and even personal finance journalists have spent decades encouraging people to use their 401K plans and it's already difficult enough to use an IRA.</p><p>The rules are exceedingly complicated. So when you now limit how much somebody can contribute to their define contribution plan, you are really giving them the stick in a very uncomfortable place if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And how much money are we really talking about in terms of savings? I mean, there's this debate of the state and local tax deduction and they're talking about a compromise here.</p><p>Are they going to put a cap on it at a certain salary level whereas you won't be able to deduct that. Maybe they are looking for more money and they're figuring maybe there's more money in the 401K part of the story because they're going to be losing some revenue if they put a cap on that and they can't overall eliminate the entire deduction.</p><p>So how much money are we really talking about in terms of 401Ks?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the state and local deduction is $1.3 trillion, I get that. If they can't eliminate that deduction altogether, that's cutting into the $1.3 trillion in revenue. So what are we talking about in terms of 401K, in terms of revenue?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And one thing I'll add Maria, the one -- again, as -- again, this is supposed to be tax reform, it's supposed to make filing our taxes easier.</p><p>One idea up for discussion, replace the state and local tax deduction with the tax credit worth between eight and twenty percent of household property tax payment with caps for married couples starting between $250,000 and $400,000, that's an idea. Way to reform the tax code, way to reform it. Genius.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well there goes the complications. All right. We'll keep talking about that. But first, coming up, disgraceful, that is what the president is calling the reports that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded that dossier that claimed <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had links to Russia during the election, that's next. We're back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, upping the ante in the air, United app now gives you boarding passes for all your connecting flights even if they are on other airlines, we'll tell you all about it. Back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Officials have hit another major roadblock in the Las Vegas shooting investigation. Cheryl Casone in New York right now with details and headlines. Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria and good morning. \"ABC News\" is reporting that a laptop found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was missing the hard drive depriving police of possible clues on why he unleashed that attack.</p><p>According to the report, investigators discover that Paddock had bought software that's used to erase files from a hard drive. Meanwhile, Mandalay Bay security guard, Jesus Campos reportedly, get this, left the country days after the shooting and he went to Mexico. He did though appear on the Ellen DeGeneres Show for an interview.</p><p>All right. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>slamming Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee over the Russian dossier they built against him. The president appeared on \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Don't forget, Hillary Clinton totally denied this. She didn't know anything, she knew nothing. All of a sudden they found out. What I was amazed that it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally discredited, it's a total phony, I call it fake news, it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired researched firm Fusion GPS to produce the infamous dossier alleging ties between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Russia.</p><p>A washout group now filing a complaint accusing them of breaking a campaign finance laws by failing to disclose the money that they spent on the dossier.</p><p>Well, travelers on U.S. bound flights facing tougher security measure due to terrorism concerns and that starts today. Those measures could include questioning and increased screening of electronic devices.</p><p>Also, United Airlines telling its passengers they need to get to the airport three hours before their flight.</p><p>And then speaking of United, the carrier says its app now allows flyers to get their boarding passes on their smartphone when they have connections on another airline. United says it's the only U.S.-based carrier that currently offers that feature.</p><p>And it was a Hollywood thriller for game two of the World Series. The House Astros were three outs away from falling behind 2-0 to the Dodgers but several heroes stepped up and the Astros outlasted the Dodgers 76, and get this, 11 innings to even the series at one game a piece.</p><p>It was a night of dramatic swings and a World Series record, eight home runs, five of which were in the extra innings. That series now shifts to Houston, Maria. And those are your headlines coming out of New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. An exciting World Series so far, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Meanwhile, \"NBC\" analyst and author Mark Halperin is now apologizing this morning. He is facing accusations of sexual harassment allegedly going back several years and at multiple TV networks. We'll tell you about it when we come right back.</p><p>And then the World Series now all nodded up, the Astros win game two of the series in dramatic fashion as you just heard. We've got more on what went on behind the game, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>I'm coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is getting tough on trade meanwhile, the president saying that changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement are necessary, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever. Right now Mexico and Canada have such a great deal, it's so good that it's very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way anymore.</p><p>We're being very tough and we're being very fair but we have to get back a lot. What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable. The jobs that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is incredible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me now with the first on FOX Business interview with DOW Chemical CEO, Executive Chairman of DOW DuPont, Andrew Liveris. Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>ANDREW LIVERIS, CEO, DOW CHEMICAL: Nice to be with you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So we heard the president talking about trade there, we want to talk about that with you but also talk about where you are in terms of this deal and the splitting of the three companies.</p><p>DOW Chemical based in Michigan first, talk to us about trade and where you see the challenges and opportunities.</p><p>LIVERIS: Well as you know with the president's agenda free trade versus pay trade and when I wrote the book, \"Making it in America\" I talked about fair trade and I do believe that as the United States does its trade agenda in the world refreshing our trade agreement.</p><p>So there's fairness both sides. We're a consumption economy in the United States therefore by definition an importer. But we need to become an investment economy as a consequence become an exporter.</p><p>The chemical industry is the number two exporter off of aerospace in the United States, we're a big part of this trade conversation whether it be NAFTA, Canada, Looms Lodge (ph), Vodal (ph), and what we up in Canada, but China Looms Lodge (ph). And I'll be part of the visit to China here in a couple weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Terrific.</p><p>LIVERIS: -- where we'll be talking a lot about trade as well. So I'm all for calibrating trades so it's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why haven't they been fair so far? I mean do you agree with what the president is saying in terms of Canada and Mexico having this great deal that the U.S. is at a disadvantage?</p><p>LIVERIS: I do. I do think it's because of our mindset. We've spent six decades since the martial plan the consumer. I would tell you over and over we haven't given much thought to being an investor now in economy in things like manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.</p><p>We haven't had an industrial policy and we barely have an energy policy. So the president is putting emphasis on what can I do to create jobs in America as an exporter of manufactured goods and I'm all for that.</p><p>And I do believe we haven't attended to it very well and therefore we allow these free trade agreements where people can export to us and when they export to us they're exporting goods but they have the jobs over there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. And that sort of became the template when we did the NAFTA deal. Companies now said, \"Okay, no problem. I will have all my jobs in Mexico and then I'll just sell to the U.S.\"</p><p>LIVERIS: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're the former head of the president's manufacturing council, you're obviously working with the president closely on this, how do you want to see NAFTA change?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well it does need to be refreshed for the modern era. I think the 21st Century is a digital century. I do think automation and factories are changing in competitiveness, and I don't think our labor arbitrage is the reason we should be investing in factories.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS: We should be investing in factories for all the things that go with it including human capital. So I am pro a reset on NAFTA.</p><p>Now, of course, fair trade is going to take give and take but I do think it's an agenda and I'm all for what's going on with NAFTA. Secretary Ross is incredibly good at this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great.</p><p>LIVERIS: We've known him for a long time --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course you have. Sure. Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS: And we know -- he knows business. So I really think a sit at the table for business to help recalibrate manufacturing whether it be NAFTA or China is very necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: DOW Chemical, DuPont did a merger in August, you're planning on splitting into three companies, how is that going? What can you tell us in terms of the status?</p><p>LIVERIS: Well great stock. We took a little while to close the deal but we did it as you said in the timeframe you did. So now we're furiously putting together all the synergies and soon we'll have a lot to say about the timing of the spins and we'll have our earnings call next week, and looked the company's storied companies, 300 years of history.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Incredible. I know that, yes.</p><p>LIVERIS: Can you imagine what we're doing to rearrange the assets and the cultures of these three dynamic growth companies. But look, a great start and Ed (INAUDIBLE) and I working close, basically twins right now to put this together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the growth is really in the chemicals business.</p><p>LIVERIS: Well it's all three. I'd say the agricultural company we're creating will be a category winner. The materials, chemicals company category winner, and this new special company we're creating, all four divisions in their own right a number one or number of in their businesses.</p><p>So all three will be growth companies and frankly, come the time we spin we'll have an amazing investor stories. But we're at all stock price high right now. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Obviously investors have reacted in it. Yes.</p><p>LIVERIS: Investors have seen as a positive move. And this deal took 10 years in the making Maria. You and I probably talked about this 10 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. You're right.</p><p>LIVERIS: And here we are, it can be done to refresh corporations at scale, not easy but it can be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I didn't realize that chemicals was the second largest expert. That's incredible actually.</p><p>LIVERIS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Real quick, you're here in Saudi, you've been here for a long time, you've been coming back and you see opportunities to sell here.</p><p>LIVERIS: I'm a big fan of the crowned prince and what he's doing. We're an early adapted to his vision, vision 2030. We have finished the $22 billion industrial complex based on advance materials and chemicals with Saudi Aramco.</p><p>It's starting up. The quality of the Saudi workforce, best in class around the world. The talent here, we have 4,000 young Saudis, very impressed. When we train them around the world, our people who train them didn't want to let them come back, they were that great.</p><p>And this complex is a harbinger what's to come here. I believe beyond oil and what they're doing here to diversify and to really what he said on your panel the other day to really bring to world a new form of Islam and how he's going to do it.</p><p>I'm a big fan. I come here three to five times a year and I would tell you that we are investors here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's pretty incredible what they're trying to do here. I mean it feels seismic. Andrew, it's great to see you.</p><p>LIVERIS: Thank you. Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LIVERIS: Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the developments. Andrew Liveris there.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas for the President's infrastructure plan. There are reports of a gas tax hike to fund the trillion-dollar tax package. We will tell you about that. And then the earnings keep on rolling this morning when the busiest days of the quarter. New equipment, bigger jets, will change at UPS help the bottom line ahead of the holiday busy season. We will tell you about that, earnings on tax. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. It is Thursday, October 26th, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Earnings split on Wall Street today, one of the top companies reporting before the opening bell this morning, Twitter, Ford Motor, UPS, and Comcast. We are all (INAUDIBLE) as soon as the numbers hit the tape. We will bring them to you. Duncan brand just reporting hitting the tape earlier this hour.</p><p>Revenue tops expectations at Duncan but earnings per share, a slight miss, as you can see that stock has done well in the last three months. The earnings news does not stop there. We've got a big night tonight after the closing bell. We will hear from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, of course, these stocks have been lightning rods in terms of money moving into them, although they haven't been trading down going into these numbers. We'll have those numbers for you and analysis as soon as they hit the tape as well.</p><p>Futures this morning, searching for some direction, take a look at markets right now, where we see the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 all higher but just by a fraction. In Europe, stocks are higher as well. Take a look at the European indices right here, which are off by about a third of a percent on average, FT 100 up 25 points, CAC Quarante up a half of a percent, that's 27 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 45.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of the Hang Seng and KOSPI. Shanghai composite in China up a third of a percent, the Nikkei Average in Japan, also higher. Rebuilding America, White House Chief Economic Adviser, Gary Cohn, reportedly telling lawmakers that a gas tax could be in play next year when the administration unveils its infrastructure package. What that means for your wallet, coming up. Walgreens, meanwhile, battling the opioid crisis in America, the drugstore is now stocking the lifesaving nasal spray, Narcan. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>weighed in on the opioid crisis while speaking with Lou Dobbs last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The opioid is a tremendous emergency, what's going on there? The drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still, we need the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is the drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The very latest, coming up this morning, as the President prepares to officially declare the opioid epidemic, a public health emergency. Meanwhile, there's this, NBC News Analyst and Author, Mark Halperin is apologizing this morning after sexual assault accusations. The details after five women have come forward with harassment claims against him. Uber goes further to target millennials' money. We're breaking down the perks that come with the ride-sharing services' first credit card, yes, an Uber credit card. We'll tell you about it.</p><p>But first, our live all-day today at day three of the Future Investment Initiatives, here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning. It's another big day of exclusive news-making interviews among the big names that I'll be speaking with today, the CEO and President of Evercore, Ralph Schlosstein is with us, Venture Capitalist, Peter Thiel. I'll be on stage with him later to talk about technology, in particular, A.I., and the President of the New York Stock Exchange, Tom Farley is here, as we watch so many Wall Streeters and investment professionals wanting in, on that Saudi Aramco, huge IPO, coming to market we're expecting next year.</p><p>First though, let's turn to the President's ambitious agenda on infrastructure, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn reportedly told House lawmakers in a private meeting yesterday, that they will get a chance to vote on a gas tax early next year, when Congress considers Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure package, that's according to Politico. Other reports suggest that it could be a 0.07-cent increase on gas taxes. I want to bring in the Head of America's Largest Construction and Civil Engineering Company, Bechtel Group, the CEO and Chairman, Brendan Bechtel is with us, Brendan, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRENDAN BECHTEL, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF BECHTEL GROUP: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think about a gas tax -- gas tax increase? What does that say about the demand for infrastructure and how -- what kind of an impact might that have?</p><p>BECHTEL: Well, I think to quantify the challenge -- the demand for infrastructure globally is about $3 trillion a year (INAUDIBLE) within the U.S. alone, we expected about $2 trillion dollars required over the next 10 years in the United States. So, there has been political consensus, I would say, really, throughout the election season and lately around the need for infrastructure, the challenge, the debate is around how to pay for it. The gas tax is one way that we might solve that challenge. It's not been even an inflation-adjusted for many, many years now and it has traditionally been one of the biggest revenue screens that's funded public infrastructure in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do think we will see an infrastructure plan from this administration?</p><p>BECHTEL: I think there's a very clear focus on tax reform as the first priority. What I'm hearing is that infrastructures in the landing pattern after that, but it's all about tax reform in the short-term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I want to ask you about the economy, because I know you're watching Copper, obviously, and that's going to tell us something. But let me get your take on this, the Crown Prince, the future king of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, told me about his plans for this new city NEOM, a futuristic city set to debut in 2030. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE MOHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA: The city will be built on the newest technologies of today. The opportunity is unimaginable. A region that is almost vacant. There are many dreams from the Saudi leadership, many of the Saudis and many our partners and of the large companies or individuals, thousands of dreams that will be established in NEOM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sounds like an incredible opportunity. Bechtel has a long- standing partnership, 75 years. You go back in Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BECHTEL: Yes, next year will be our 75th anniversary. I think this is so exciting. The Crown Prince's speech on your panel, and there are a lot of subtle messages in there too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There were.</p><p>BECHTEL: For those of us that have been around a while, are very significant milestones. But specifically, the example of NEOM, I think it's demonstrative of the vision, that's laid out in vision 2030. It's a bold, ambitious but achievable plan. I think an interesting way to talk about this is to reflect on Bechtel's history in Saudi Arabia's. When we got started 74 years ago in the 40s and 50s, we are working on oil pipelines (INAUDIBLE) on basic civil infrastructure like railways. In the 1970s, we started on Jubail, which at the time, was a fishing village. Today, 40 years later, we are still working there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>BECHTEL: And it is the largest industrial city in the Middle East and it accounts for somewhere between four and five percent of Saudi Arabia's non- oil GDP. So, well, I've been here at the conference, people have been coming up and asking me, do you think this is achievable? All the projects that are laid out in vision 2030, do you think it's possible? And I said, again, remember this example of Jubail, 40 years ago, it was a fishing village, today, it's the largest industrial city in the region. I think the difference is, I don't think the Crown Prince is going to give us 40 years to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BECHTEL: This is -- he is -- he is -- he is really driving everyone to keep up, which I think, is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible, the vision that he's ha and really pushing to change some of the historic cultures here, opening it up to foreign investment, allowing women to drive. We've talked about that on the panel. Let me ask you about Copper. I mean, if you look at a chart of Copper, it's had a tough 10 years, obviously, but now we're seeing money moved back into Copper. What does that tell you?</p><p>BECHTEL: Well, so I think, with respect to growth, it's one of the things we're most excited about. So we felt roughly about a third of all the Copper concentrators on earth. I'm particularly focused in Chile and the Indies. And based on the study work that we are doing which is a pretty good predictor of big project investment decisions over the next few years, we are seeing things start to pick back up and that is driven predominantly by the Copper price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And do you think that Copper, at this point, is indicative of the fact that we are seeing a pickup in housing and Copper, obviously, goes in everything from cars to your house. So is it indicative --</p><p>BECHTEL: Electrical wires.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Electrical wires, so is it indicative of construction?</p><p>BECHTEL: Yes, I think it's a good -- it has to be a pretty good leading indicator of an interest in construction activity broadly. So I do think it's a good indicator of that, but I also think the mining sectors, so Cepacol and Boom-Bust in terms of oversupply, undersupply, and the way they approach CAPEX investments. And so, you know, 10 years ago, it appeared with a lot of big projects going on to meet the demand and then it got a little overbuilt and then, I would say, demands have been building, building, building and it's time to start doing projects again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how would you characterize the economy right now from that standpoint in terms of construction and what you're seeing in commodities?</p><p>BECHTEL: I would say, so, we still continue in the oil and gas market, it's still across most the mining sector, low cost is king. It's all about low cost. And so it's all about who can work their way down the cost supply curve. Growth markets for us within that year, you're looking at Niche Play so anything that benefits from cheap Shell gas in the U.S. is a winner, so Petrochemicals, combined cycle natural gas power plants. I would say more broadly, you've got for us, the big growth opportunity in the U.S. and I would say around the world right now is infrastructure. It's public works. It's anything that benefits from the lower cost of rock commodities which are key inputs to the global economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really, fascinating stuff, Brendan, great to have you on the program.</p><p>BECHTEL: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the developments, literally, Brendan Bechtel joining us there. Coming up, as the President is previewing his plan to declare a public health emergency for the opiate epidemic today, Walgreens is revealing it will stock the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses. We'll tell you about that. Then, Uber is thinking about a credit card, the ride-sharing service teaming up with Visa, for a branded car that offers some unexpected perks, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, everybody. Markets are flat right now, but it's all about earnings today. We are watching the earnings hitting the tape; that will drive markets. Things have turned around. We're looking at a market that is going to be opening fractionally higher on the session. Dow Industrials up about 10 points right now.</p><p>UPS, certainly a name to watch today. The company is set to report its third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning. Analysts expect earnings of a $1.45 a share. The stock of UPS up over 10 percent in the last year.</p><p>We're also watching shares of Mattel. The toymaker is set to report its third-quarter earnings after the bell tonight. Analysts looking for earnings there, $0.58 a share. And shares of Mattel, it's had a tough year, it's down more than 40 percent this year alone.</p><p>Sexual harassment charges against an NBC news analyst and a former NBC news political director. Cheryl Casone with the details right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: Well, Maria, a number of women have accused Author, Mark Halperin, of Senior Political Analyst and frequent contributor for NBC News and MSNBC of sexual harassment. The women talked to CNN about the alleged lewd behavior from Halperin who co-authored the book \"Game Change,\" and who also stars in the hit Showtime series \"The Circus.\" In a statement, Halperin admits he pursued relationships with younger women and he has apologized for any inappropriate behavior.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>telling Fox Business he's going to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis. In an interview with Lou Dobbs, Trump says the border wall will help the war on drugs as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The opioid is a tremendous emergency. What's going on there? The drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I'll tell you what, we've made a big impact, but still we need the wall, you know, part of the reason we need the wall is for drugs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Trump is expected to give a preview of his plans for tackling the opioid crisis later on today.</p><p>Meanwhile, Walgreens says that all of its pharmacies nationwide will now stock Narcan in the battle against opioids. The nasal spray can reverse the effects of an overdose on those drugs, which includes some prescription painkillers and heroin. Shares of Walgreens parent company are down by more than 18 percent so far, this year. Walgreen Boots Alliance, a stock to watch today.</p><p>And this may not come as a surprise to fans of Uber: they're launching a credit card in partnership with Barclays and Visa. Besides being convenient for the customers, the card will also give Uber valuable information about its riders, because they like that. The card has no fee and offers a number of benefits, cash bonuses, especially based on how much you charge for it. But again, Maria, how much information are you willing to give to Uber?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Well, there you go. They have the data. They're going to share it. Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, robots officially living among us, at least right here in Saudi Arabia. A robot has been granted citizenship in the Saudi Kingdom. We will tell you about that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! I am live this morning on day three of the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. For the first time ever, a robot here was granted citizenship yesterday. It all happened right here in Saudi Arabia. Joining us right now is Uptake Technologies CEO and Co-Founder, Brad Keywell. Brad, it is nice to have you on the program.</p><p>BRAD KEYWELL, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES: Pleasure to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, great to see you. Here we are in Saudi. You co-founded and sit on the board of a number of manufacturing and technology companies, and you founded a ton of companies including Groupon, we should say.</p><p>KEYWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Talk to us about artificial intelligence. I feel like, if you're not using A.I., you're going to be left behind.</p><p>KEYWELL: I do think that the next -- the fourth industrial revolution about unleashing not just people's best, but the best of what data and the machines around us can tell us to make people even better. And so, this is core to what's happening in technology, and so we are one of the -- one of the leaders that's taking this idea and making it actionable.</p><p>A quick example is in the world of Locomotives. We actually give the operators of Locomotives a health score, so they know before they deploy that Locomotive to go from one city to the next, they'd know that it won't break. So, the philosophy is that things shouldn't break, and in this emerging industrial revolution, we will all be better off because our assets, our industries will be more productive and more reliable, and really safer which is a big part of our value proposition as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I can totally see that because you've had sensors basically checking the safety and the health of whatever it is. And that even applies to human beings, by the way.</p><p>KEYWELL: Absolutely. We can all be better. So, what's the operating system to make us better, and as it relates to our personal lives? There's an operating system on our phones. As it relates to our industries and business, especially manufacturing and some of the utility that runs our world, the operating system has to start with sensors, sensor-generated data, and then be deployed and that's what -- Uptake is exclusively focused on turning that possibility into action.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Uptake Technology is used in a range of products, and industries we know from energy to aviation; employing 800 people; $200 billion valuations there. Let's talk about the bad news, OK, and that is robots are probably going to replace humans, aren't they?</p><p>KEYWELL: I disagree.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KEYWELL: You know, my idea is -- and what we are proving out is that people are -- humans are made superhuman through the intelligence that can be derived from these sensors. And there is a clear argument that gets -- that gets made about the possibility that there'd be no humans, that there'd be autonomous everything. But these are, you know, the art of extracting minerals from the ground, and the art of producing oil and the rest. This is something that has historically involved humans, and I just don't see that changing.</p><p>I do see humans and the people that are part of these industries elevating their skills; I do see technology like we make it uptake, making them even better at what they do. And I also see a new philosophy that there's going to be winners and losers, and that's part of admiration to crown prince and kingdom, which is there's a commitment to being at the forefront and leadership role as it relates to deploying predictive analytics into industry and smart cities -- which we talked about as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. I mean, that's something that he's committed to, I know; he said that the other day on the panel. And this is going to be probably one of most innovative cities we've ever seen, by the way.</p><p>KEYWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Masa, from Softbank, also was on the panel on Tuesday, and he said at some point there will be more robots than humans, you don't think so? Even if it's the same amount, it's amazing.</p><p>KEYWELL: I don't envision the city with robots -- with more robots moving around the street than people. I do envision cities that have operating systems like Uptake that are optimizing every aspect of that city, that are more environmentally responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That makes sense.</p><p>KEYWELL: That is more -- the traffic moves more fluidly, that everybody's life has improved based upon people being smarter deriving data from all the ambient activities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it more cost-effective, Brad, with technology, yes?</p><p>KEYWELL: What we're seeing in actual deployments in some of these industries like aviation, and rail, and construction is that the return of investment when you buy uptake's products, you're talking three, five, seven, ten returns if you're the company buying our software. So, it's an extraordinary time in the world of technology. And as an entrepreneur, to find an ability to impact real industries the way we have, that's -- that's extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fascinating stuff, Brad, you'll have to come back and tell us all about it.</p><p>KEYWELL: Happy to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>KEYWELL: OK. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brad Keywell from Uptake. We'll be right back. Stay with us live from Riyadh this morning.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the Future Investment Initiative, here's <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>with the

Let's carry on talking about cloud. The race for control of the cloud very much on at the moment. Big tech companies getting into the space, driving down prices. As ever, it's the survival of the fittest. Will the lesser known names manage to stay competitive and in business?  </p><p>      Rackspace Hosting has had a challenging couple years, but with shares up last night, investors a little bit more upbeat about this cloud computing company. So how did the company weather the storm and what happens next? Its CEO is a gentleman called Taylor Rhodes, and he's sitting next to me. Good morning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR RHODES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RACKSPACE HOSTING</emphasis>: Good morning, Guy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Tough to be small in a - in an increasing big world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: Well I think you can look at examples in industries that evolve over time. And you've always got the bulk players, the volume players, and you've got the specialists who are in profitable niches. You've got lots of news this morning about Tescos, but at the same time Waitrose is doing quite well. So in any industry, there is the bulk volume and then there's the specialty play. And Rackspace has always been the specialist in the industry that adds value on top of commodity infrastructure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Nice line drawing there between one and the other. It's - it's a fair point to make, and in some ways if you were to go back to that Waitrose analogy, Waitrose is a more managed story.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Tescos is a - some would say a less manage story in store. You just throw everything in there and - and hopefully people will buy it. Is this a divergence we're now going to see between managed cloud storage and unmanaged cloud storage? These are effectively two different businesses.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: They are, and I think that's the takeaway. The first five years of cloud - cloud really got started in 2008 and '09 because global financial crisis meant people had to shed costs. Risk tolerance for trying new models was on, but the early five years of cloud were really driven by developers, software engineers who said, the CIO, he's too slow. I want to solve a problem a new way. Here's something where I can buy it on a utility basis. It's available now. I can go develop. But really those developers, the early adopters are very technologically savvy. They want to play with the technology.  </p><p>      But now the mainstream market, as it always does, is starting to say cloud is compelling. Different economics. It makes infrastructure available. How am I going to use it? I may not have all of those tech skills on my payroll. So you're going to see this unmanaged model where you have technically savvy people who want to control more, and you're going to see the mainstream market prefer a managed cloud model that infrastructure is a component, but how do you manage it?  </p><p>      The other interesting thing is as commodity continues to creep into cloud and prices get cheaper for the inputs, that's software and that's hardware, what's going to proliferate are tools and software that take advantage of the ubiquity of cheap infrastructure which creates complexity for mainstream companies. They have a hard time keeping up with the tech skills required to manage the cloud themselves. So we'll see this transition from early adoption, which was unmanaged cloud, to mainstream adoption, which is managed cloud.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Shall I think about this as hardware and software? I -   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: And service.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yeah. So it's a kind of a service. You are the service option. They - they are the kind of - they are the hardware option, and - and - and how different do those two markets become?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: I think that if you - if you think about a traditional software company, let's just talk about SaaS or cloud-delivered software. You think about a Microsoft or a VMWare. They used to sell you a license. You bought it as a - as a thing that you paid a price for (inaudible) paid a perpetual maintenance license on.  </p><p>      And now because the cloud has said, well we're going to tip that model over, we don't like that model anymore, it doesn't fit the cost structure that we want to drive in our businesses, we want to make technology utility or usage-based pricing. Software is going to be monetized more and more in cloud service models. So we take inputs from Microsoft, VMWare and other providers of hardware and software. We build a cloud service model around them and we deliver that technology in a service context to our customers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: So you're more IBM?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: Well, I think it's a - it's a good model for the free cloud era. I think in the cloud era our model looks more like IBM from a service management perspective delivering value on top of commodity infrastructure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: When you look at the - sort of the potential for your business further down the road, how different is it in the United States and how different is it here in Europe? We were talking to our last guest from Google about the differences that exist between the adoption of cloud, the concern surrounding cloud, and the regulatory story surrounding cloud here in Europe versus the United States. How different is it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: It's quite different, and I think Barack (ph) from Google made a great point, which is because Europe isn't one homogenous thing, it is lots of different countries together, you naturally have the friction and complexity of those different models looking at data privacy, looking at the consumer, and trying to plan the right policy.  </p><p>      But inevitably, because it's a more complex environment, it will move more slowly. There will be frictions built in, versus more - pardon me. I meant to say it is more of a heterogeneous market where the US is more of a homogenous market. There's a common policy and framework. And so you always see the US markets 18 to 24 months ahead of - of the European market in terms of technology adoption, and I think that's one of the reasons why.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Is that just a structural impediment that we're just - we're going to have to get used to in Europe, or is it something that we can deal with, find a way around and move on from?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: I think as with anything, if you think about ecommerce years ago, people were very hesitant to buy online. They were afraid someone was going to steal their - their credit card number. But it's matured. It's evolved, and now it's a very accepted business model. Cloud will do the same thing. I think it will just develop at pace. As things like compliancy and standards get addressed in cloud models, that will accelerate adoption.   </p><p>      My hope is that governments here take a very technology and business-friendly approach to cloud because cloud really does speed the innovation of business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Is that hope over expectation? Do you - over reality? What do you think is really going to happen? That's your hope. What do you think is going to happen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: Well I don't have a crystal ball on Brussels, but I do think it will take - it'll take longer. But if you look at cloud adoption, the US is arguably a couple of years ahead further into this. But I moved to London in 2010, spent three years here, and I can tell you that the inflection curve started to catch up. So as the economics of cloud get more and more compelling, you're going to see a larger and larger din from the business marketplace to treat it with fair policies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Just one final question on security. Security seems to be a bigger issue over here as well, though arguably that shouldn't be the case. Do you think businesses understand the cloud yet? Do you think that we fully have grasped what we're doing in terms of what effectively is the - the crown jewels of our business, data? Every company now, its data is everything. We're handing it over to you. Do I as a - as a CEO understand what I'm giving you do you think at this stage?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RHODES</emphasis>: I think that markets go through hype and then wisdom, and the cloud market has gone through tremendous hype. Even the word cloud has been so overhyped. It's become shorthand for buying computing as a service essentially, but there's - underneath the covers there's lots of different ways. The market is evolving with a preference for what's called hybrid cloud. That means some things will be in a private cloud context which you can manage with a partner or yourself for solely your environment.   </p><p>      You don't share the tin (ph) or the computing or networking with anybody else. And then there's also public cloud, which is generally the model that a Google would field which is it's shared pools of compute and networking and storage spread over many customers. So what's happening in the market as it goes from hype to wisdom, it's saying private clouds have a real role where data security and privacy and performance of high - hard-hitting databases, but then also the ability to use public cloud right along side for things that are highly variable matter.  </p><p>      I'll give you a good example. Our customer in the UK, Domino's Pizza, every Tuesday night for the football they run an offer. And they used to have build out physical infrastructure every time they had a very high spike in volume, right? Now that they can use the cloud, they say, right, I'm concerned about data privacy for my consumer's credit cards. I'm going to run that in a private cloud. I'm going to connect that into a public cloud for burstability. Therefore I don't have to buy the peak. I can pay for the base of the business. I can rent the peak, pay for what I use and then turn it off. So that's a very good example of a mainstream market application of hybrid cloud.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Using pizzas as the - as the story. Nice to see you, Taylor. Thank you very much indeed for stopping by.  </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Mamuka. Now I would like to invite our Deputy Chairman and the other Co-Founder of the bank, Badri Japaridze.</p><p>BADRI JAPARIDZE, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I'm happy to be again with you after 1 year of having -- announcing some of the -- and I'm glad to report that the country is performing as well as it was performing before, and I will highlight some of the new trends and new achievements Georgia has -- can be proud of.</p><p>So in order to understand the reasons of success of TBC Bank, we need to understand better operating environment we are operating in last 25 years and dynamics and improvements of this environment, which has resulted in the achievements of our institution. First of all, of course, the country has made a long way in its development. And there is still long way to go, but we can say that Georgia can be proud to be one of the most attractive destinations, investment destinations in the region and beyond. So Georgia continues its remarkable progress towards being one of the most attractive investment destination, and we are among the highest-ranking countries in many regards. Today, Georgia ranks #6 in ease of doing business globally, up from #9 in 2018. This is a reflection of being #2 in ease of starting business, #4 in ease of registering property, #2 in protecting minority investors, also countries among top performance in several other key rankings.</p><p>What is I think quite a good achievement that features upgraded country recently to BB level. And so we are pretty close to the investment-grade ranking. On Open Budget Index globally, we are #5; Economic Freedom Index, #16. And Georgia always was one of the most compared to the countries in regard of success and regime and remains as most competitive. And we are -- basically, after the last tax reform when we invested profit been -- related on taxes, we can say that success and regime got even more liberal. Another positive dynamics is Georgia's continuously improving credit rating, as I have mentioned. Improving risk perception of the country reflects proven resilience of the economy towards unfavorable external developments, which, unfortunately, taking place in our neighborhood. But what is important that we are less and less dependent on those negative developments in the neighborhood and this is because of the diversified character of Georgian economy. Good news is also narrowing current account deficit. And overall, Georgia was always famous recent -- especially last 10 to 15 years by prudent monitor and fiscal stance. Georgian lari is free float in currency. We can say that Georgian lari is among the best-performing emerging countries' currencies. Last 1 year, National Bank also improved. It was buying more reserves and has increased foreign currency reserves by 18%.</p><p>Towards this constant inflow of FDI last 10 to 15 years, we see the same trend despite of the fact that big infrastructure project, British Petroleum, has completed. Still, we see the growth of FDI.</p><p>Good news is on the GDP growth. So in April, 5.1% growth was reported. So in average, from the beginning of this year, GDP grew by 4.8%. It is very much likely that by end of the year, GDP will grow by 5%.</p><p>As I mentioned, business trend environment is one of the explanations why Georgian economy remains resilient, and it also drives FDI growth -- FDI flow in Georgia. And what is important that, of course, our neighborhood is not easy. But I think Georgia was, as a country, smart enough to consider this neighborhood as more opportunity than as difficult and to benefit from this not easy environment. We, as a country, are operating in -- are located. We can say that Georgian economy is more aligned with the Central and Eastern European countries while having higher growth rates. According to IMF, Georgian economy is expected to outperform CE and neighboring countries over the next 5 years.</p><p>Overall, we can witness increasing diversification and shift towards EU as a trend. And what is important that despite more integration into EU, Georgia is very open to increase its trade with new markets, especially with Middle East and China. And that's also -- is reflected in increasing FDI from those countries. We can see that the traditional drivers of Georgian -- growth of Georgian economy, traditional industries, especially tourists, which, every year, is beating new highs, new record highs. Just recently was published a number that year-on-year basis, tourists grew by 18%. And it looks like that Georgia is becoming one of the most popular destinations. And the 10 million number for tourists per year looks like it's easy to achieve in nearest future. So also, we have seen the growth on remittances side. And overall, we can say the inflows grew by 18.7%.</p><p>We need to highlight that when inflows to GDP ratio stands at around 70% and the natural level of loan dollarization should not be 0. While dollarization is a priority and the -- we are in a process to dedollarize economy in the banking sector high share of external inflows and therefore -- actually, therefore, FX income stream always has to be taken into account. And because of the new regulations and the steps taken by the National Bank of Georgia, we have seen that dollarization level is gradually going down. You see that there is a steady growth of remittances in the tourists, and what is important trend is quite a significant growth on export side.</p><p>Because we remain as one of the most attractive investment destination, we see FDI inflow not going down but is increasing. If we take out the impact of the year, infrastructure project completed by the British Petroleum, there are new infrastructure projects coming in. We need to mention, of course, deep sea and -- we have deep sea port Anaklia project, which is in the process of active development. There is a high ratio -- meaning to say that Georgian tradition maintains one of the highest FDI to GDP ratio when compared to the peer countries. This demonstrates the preference of investors and their long-term commitments to the economy of Georgia. Important to mention that FDI inflows are invested across wide range of sectors and more than half of the foreign investments comes from EU. And also here, we need to speak about diversified character of FDI inflow. And of course, there are more popular destinations like tourism, hospitality business, energy sector, but we see more and more investments in other directions as well. In the -- I think quite long time ago, some Georgian politicians were comparing Georgia to Singapore. And it looks like that this comparison has some ground because if you look at the similarities between Singapore and Georgia, there are certain similarities, especially having large neighbors. I think it's important to mention then that Singapore was taking advantage of this, being surrounded by large neighbors. And Georgia, we see, it is trying to repeat this experience. But if you look at doing business rankings, also there's a similarity between Georgia and Singapore. And also, if you look at the role of FDI inflows and the current account deficit, there is also similarity. As you might know, in '70s and '80s, Singapore had high FDI inflows coupled with high current account deficit. If a country receives high inflows, the only way to avoid a current account deficit is to reinvest those inflows abroad. According to the Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 1970s and 1980s when Asia was rising, Singapore and South Korea had large and sustainable current account deficit -- deficits as global financiers saw that there were investment opportunities created. So Georgia -- and I was saying it during previous -- my presentations that Georgia is increasingly playing the role of the hub, regional hub in many regards: as a transit hub, and looks like the dysfunction will be enhanced by the new infrastructure projects, which are put in place; as a financial hub, because of the strong and very resilient banking industry; as educational hub, and government is committing to invest significant amount in educational system in coming years, which will more enhance and make it -- will make Georgian education system more attractive for foreign students, and we see that there is also significant increase of the foreign students coming to Georgia for education; and health care hub, and we can say that there is lot of investment going on -- going into the health care system as well; and Georgia, because of location, is logistical hub, and we'll enhance this role in the future.</p><p>Let me speak about Georgian banking industry in a few words. I think we went through this. That's again coming back to Georgia's role as a regional hub in all this respect, which I just mentioned. So Georgian banking sector, I think not many much larger countries can be proud having 2 leading backs -- banks listed in the Premium Listing, the London Stock Exchange. And not many, many banking industries navigated through so many challenges Georgian banking industry has navigated. And there was no any single bailout. We can say, therefore, that banking sector in Georgia is one of the most developed in the broader region, taking into account corporate governance, risk management, capital and liquidity levels as well as digitalization. And the Georgian banking sector is appealing industry to be an -- and generates high profitability and sustainable growth.</p><p>Of course, we need to mention the sector is conservatively regulated by National Bank of Georgia and has sound asset quality. On the asset quality side, we can say that the level of NPLs to growth loan is pretty low. It's 2.7% as of quarter 1 2018. One of the lowest level in comparison to CE and other peer countries. Prudent capital level. Together with sound asset quality, prudently regulated banking sector in Georgia results in high ratio of capital to total assets in the region, which ensures the stable and lower-risk banking environments in the country. Solid profitability. And solid profitability is emphasizing an attractiveness in Georgian banking sector. TBC Bank is delivering close totally more than 20% return on equity.</p><p>And to summarize the presentation -- as a concluding remark, let me say that while business-friendly environment and high growth rates have already been the features of Georgia, the resilience demonstrated towards the external shocks proved doing business in Georgia to be sustainable as well. This provides solid operational environment for the financial services. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Badri. Our next speaker is our CEO, Vakhtang Butskhrikidze, who will give you an overview of our strategic initiatives.</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Thank you, Zoltan. Once again, thank you for attending this event.</p><p>During my presentation, I will discuss major events over the past year, give an update on our medium-term financial guidance and present our new initiatives and our vision going forward. I'd like to begin today's presentation with a recap of our financial guidance and our performance during the last 2 years. I'm happy to say that we achieved and even outperformed all our targets that we announced after our Premium Listing in 2018 was an especially successful year. Our loan book growth reached 21.3% against our target of approximately 15%. We delivered high full year return of equity, 22.8%, against our target of 20%. Our underlying cost-to-income ratio was 37.8% against our target of below 40%. And we continue to distribute 25% of our net profit as dividends.</p><p>Now I'd like to briefly review our bank's important achievements for the last year. We further improved our outstanding digital capabilities and achieved offloading ratio of 90.6%. We continue to increase on our fee income. Our payment business is an important area of our focus. And at the end of the first quarter of 2019, 80% of all transactions we have conducted in POS, terminals and ATMs. TBC Insurance has maintained its #1 position on the retail market with 38% market share, an increase of 9 percentage points from last year. Our first fully digital bank, Space, launched in May 2018. And we already have approximately 115,000 active customers. We launched the first ecosystems in Georgia with e-commerce marketplace and real estate platform. We have achieved further progress on our international expansion plans by signing shareholder agreement with Nikoil Bank in Azerbaijan. And finally, we also -- in line with our international expansion plans, we acquired the leading payment service provider, PayMe, in Uzbekistan, now serving approximately 1.3 million customers in this market.</p><p>During the last year, we also maintained our leadership in digital channels with our best-in-class multichannel distribution platform. As you can see on this slide, we have continued to increase mobile banking penetration impressively past 2 years. We achieved particularly authentic results in mobile banking in 2018. We see the number of mobile banking transactions increasing more over than 70%. And as I have mentioned, offloading ratio continue to increase impressively. And as you see on the right-hand side of this slide, only less than 10% of the transactions we are doing in the branches.</p><p>Payment business is a strategic initiative that has key importance for our group. As an example of our achievement in that area, we had more than 60 million contactless transactions during 2018, which is around 95% of total POS transactions. And additionally, as you can see, we also introduced contactless withdrawals from ATMs, which is a novelty on the Georgian market and also in the region. And today, around 30% all the ATM transactions we are doing through -- by the contactless transactions.</p><p>As you know, about 2 years ago, we decided to enter underpenetrated insurance business in Georgia. And after 2 years of the operations, TBC Insurance has grown impressively. We continue to dominate retail market with 38 -- almost 38% market share at the end of the last year and around 40% market share at the end of the first quarter.</p><p>As you know, Space is our new full-scale digital bank. With this project, we are successfully challenging and redefining the daily banking experience. As you can see from this slide, over the past year, we have already achieved impressive growth in the number of downloads and registered customers and also -- as well as the good growth in the portfolio. Today, we have application downloads around 300,000, around 115,000 active customers and more than GEL 16 million lari portfolio.</p><p>Now I'd like to present our new vision, which is to make life easier for our customers. We plan to achieve this through 5 key strategic initiatives: core financial products, big data analytics, ecosystems, becoming an agile organization and international expansion in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. By implementing this, we plan to have 10 million users by 2022. I will describe these key strategic directions briefly in my presentation and will elaborate further on each front later today.</p><p>To achieve these challenging strategic initiatives, we need more changes and we decided to start agile transformation in November of the last year. And additionally, we believe that it is important to become agile because first, the environment is changing very fast and we have to adapt. Second, we are very fast changing and growing organization. Third, we need to be quick in responding to our customer needs. Fourth, we need to put our customer needs at the center of our work. And finally, with the agile transformation project, we want to create an exceptional work environment for our employees to increase engagement and to attract the best talent.</p><p>Now I'd like to show a brief video about how we are transferring our organization to the agile.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: As you know, we have unique position on the Georgian market. Our market share varies from 37% to 40% in all segments, and the work is around 65% of the bankable population in the country. And therefore, we have a huge amount of data. And one of our strategic initiatives to become the data-driven organization, which is -- which allow us to anticipate our customer needs and to offer tailored products and services. And last year, we already implemented this special project in the bank together with one of the utility consulting companies. And we are now planning to implement additional 23 use cases with estimated profit impact of GEL 100 million in the medium term. And we are also building capacities at the bank. Our data school of analytics has trained over 160 data analytic professionals, and we plan to train about 500 in total.</p><p>With Space, which I have already mentioned, we have ambition plans to create a fully digital banking platform as a service to support our international expansion plans. We developed Space to be transferable and replaceable. As a result, we create an important knowledge bank that will help us easily introduce Space in Azerbaijan and also in Uzbekistan before the end of 2019.</p><p>Now to -- in order to progress on our international expansion plans, we plan to increase our operations in Azerbaijan. This is an underpenetrated market with a population of about 10 million. There is a low level of digitalization in banking, and we believe that we can bring our know-how and knowledge. And we know this market through our operations through TBC Kredit for more than 10 years. As a result, we established a strategic partnership with Nikoil Bank, and we have ambition plans together with this bank. We will focus on retail, micro and SME segments and we plan to deliver over 20% return of equity in the medium term.</p><p>We are very excited about our plans to expand to the Uzbekistan market. This is also a large underpenetrated market with a population of more than 33 million and around 7% retail loans to GDP ratio. Our strategy is to create a next-generation bank for retail, micro and SME clients with the smart branches and with digital channels and our Space online banking. As I have already mentioned, we will provide further details on these markets later today.</p><p>We view payment business as part of our ecosystems and one of our strategic priorities. And our aspiration to become a regional payment provider, we plan to double our payment net revenues by 2022. And we will provide detailed presentations on the payment ecosystem during the rest of today's presentation.</p><p>As you can see on this slide, banks around the world are in the process of entering various ecosystems in order to establish long-term relationships with their customers and to add value to their brands. This is exactly what we are planning to do as well. In 2018, 2019, we already made investments in housing, marketplace ecosystems, and we are exploring opportunities in other ecosystems, too.</p><p>And I'm happy today to present these 2 ecosystems in today's presentation. Housing is part of our strategic ecosystems initiative that will support our vision of making life easier to our customers. Last year, we decided that in order to achieve our vision, it was not enough to simply provide financial services. So we decided to create ecosystems on our own or together with the strategic partners that will allow us to have more daily touch points with our customers. In January of this year, we acquired a 90% stake in a well-positioned real estate platform, which is a data-driven company providing different services for real estate stakeholders. With this acquisition, our plan to create a first housing ecosystem in the region with an exceptional user experience tradition for us as well as a diverse product range.</p><p>Now I'd like to show a new video about that.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: Another ecosystems initiative is our Vendoo marketplace. We are recreating a new e-commerce marketplace in Georgia built on innovative digital trading platform. Here, we offer a diverse product range through our partner vendors, fast delivery service and a very high customer experience. This is my last video I was showing now.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: So on this slide, I'd like to review our medium-term financial targets. We will continue to grow in line with the market and our aim to maintain our market shares. So we maintained our loan growth in the range of 10% to 15%. We've maintained our return of equity target in excess of 20%. And cost-to-income ratio guidance is below 35%. And finally, our medium-term dividend payout ratio in the range of 25% to 35%.</p><p>So this is my final slide and in closing, we aspire to expand our presence beyond Georgia and to create maximum value for our customers by integrating into their daily lives and making their lives easier. In addition, to be a customer digital financial service provider, we will be building customer-focused digital ecosystems and leveraging data science and data analytics capabilities. This is all we built and run by applying agile principles and strong focus in customer experience. Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Vakhtang.</p><p>So now it's time to dig deeper on the various initiatives that Vakhtang was just describing. The first presentation will be about building ecosystems, sort of trying to answer the questions of what, why and how. And it will be presented by 2 members of our management. And these will be our Chief Operating Officer, Tornike Gogichaishvili; followed by our CIO, Amiran Sherozia. Please.</p><p>TORNIKE GOGICHAISHVILI, DEPUTY CEO, COO &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, JSC TBC BANK: Thank you, everyone, for coming.</p><p>Today, I'll be talking about our ecosystem strategy, why it is actually in our agenda and how we're going to take advantage of it going forward. So I'll cover payment business and how we're going to play with the new perspective on the payment business in the context of the ecosystem and our new initiative on the housing sector.</p><p>But before I start, I would like set this context briefly. It is super exciting time to be alive. The environment around us is changing rapidly and, as Vakh already mentioned, we need to adapt fast. The incumbent players are becoming super competitive. They are changing the current linear business models to exponential growth models. And the recently clear boundaries among different industries are disappearing. And we see a play of examples like the eco going into the payments using the -- and leveraging on the brand and the ecosystem it has. The same attempts from the Facebook and many, many others, like telcos buying the digital content providers. So on the back office furthermost of the transformation, which is mostly driven by data and connectivity expanding the boundaries, the customers are also becoming super sophisticated. They are valuing simplicity like frictionless transactions, the control over their accounts, the transparency and so on and so forth. That's exactly why we think that ecosystem perspective is the best way to address growing consumer needs and that will enable us to come up with a holistic end-to-end customer journeys. We are actually already in the daily lives of our customers, but we need to connect more deeply to be more responsive and to be more fast in terms of the time-to-market. And also, one important aspects I really want to mention and the key differentiator perhaps that the banks and financial institutions have is a trust. Trust, especially when it comes to making a financial transaction. So that's why we believe we're going to be successful in building the ecosystems.</p><p>Now let's talk about the payments. The payment business have always been a significant part of our banking, and we're now -- not talking about something really new. But as I already mentioned, just a new perspective on it and how we're going to play with it. So according to the figures, by the end of 2018, the net revenues from the payment business contributed to 10% to our overall gross net revenues. So as you see, it's quite a significant number. In terms of the growth rates, we also have quite impressive growth rates, both in terms of the number of payments and number of volumes. As you see from the slide, we have double-digit growth rates in both cases. And in this business, TBC is a long-established market leader. Like in e-commerce and POS transaction volumes, we are 84% more than our closest competitor. We have the largest acquiring network, which, of course, brings revenues for us in terms of the fee and commissions, but also is a very important source of our liquidity. And of course, the mobile and Internet banking transactions. We are 44% more than our closest competitor. Did you know that banks are on the second place after social media in terms of the average number of touch points? It was quite surprising for us as well in data statistic. So but more importantly, the 90% of these touch points are payment-related. That's why we feel that we're -- we may be missing something, and we need to build up on an ecosystem perspective and take a full advantage of it to be more close to the customers and be responsive, as I already mentioned.</p><p>So now to give you the idea of where is the growth coming from and why we think that we will be able to grow the revenues in the multiple directions, let's discuss the 3 core pillars: the first one is the infrastructure; the second one is the market potential; and the third one is the opportunity for us to change the customer behavior.</p><p>So in terms of the payment business physical infrastructure, Georgia is at par with most of the CE countries. As you see, the infrastructure has been growing over the years. However, in terms of the average transaction frequency and the average transaction value, Georgia still falls short of its peer countries in CE. But apparently, it is also a good news because we anticipate a growth potential here as well, especially by focusing on changing our customer behavior from using the ATM cash withdrawals heavily to moving them to more sophisticated payment solutions where we could earn more revenues. And now to continue the topic on the growth potentials from the TBC perspective, let's discuss it on our case, right?</p><p>So on a comparative scale in a country with population of 3.5 million people, TBC has unique and active clients over 1 million users. It is quite significant. And on top of it, 0.5 million unregistered customers, which mostly are using our network of self-service terminals, so called kiosks, right, to make the small ticket size transactions like mobile top-ups, small loan repayments, utility payments and so on and so forth. So we see a unique opportunity to get more engaged with those -- our registered customers and offer our digital payment solutions, which are of course more handy and an opportunity for us to earn more money as well.</p><p>So in terms of the average transaction frequency and the average transaction value, TBC figures are basically way above the country average figures. Although -- and they are growing quite fast as you see the 40% growth on the year over and the 25% respectively, right? But the interesting part is that more than 50% of these transactions are ATM cash withdrawals, which are attributable to the TBC retail banking payroll-related customers. So as you see, the customers withdraw their money from the very first week as long as they get salary. So we see a huge opportunity again to switch it with behavior. And of course, this behavior is naturally changing over the time.</p><p>This is our Georgia part in terms of the opportunities, but of course we are not going to stop here, and our aspiration is to become the regional payments provider rather than just a local bank. And in that regard, we already made a first step and we acquired the payment company in Uzbekistan country, which population is 33 million people and my colleague, Giorgi Shagidze, will cover this topic in detail later on.</p><p>Yet another ecosystems that we're tapping -- sorry, let me sum up the payments. So basically, the high-level numbers and the key targets that Vakhtang already shared with you, we're going to double our net revenues from the payment business by 2022, and that will be more than GEL 200 million, with an average growth rate of 20% annually, and we decided to, as you already understood, we decided to put the payment business to our strategic priority. And in terms of the actions, this strategy translated into established dedicated business structure, dedicated business line, with the consolidation of all the management, all the talent and leadership into one vertical. They're putting the sales directed end-to-end teams into this vertical, which are going to be responsible for each of our segments like corporate, MSME and retail business. Of course, the innovation factor, which is actually very much embedded in our culture, and we believe is one of the key factors to success especially when we talk about the payment business. And in that regard, TBC has been first on the market to introduce many innovative products, like P2P payments, voice transfers, contactless cash withdrawals. And these are not just innovations, these innovations are actually bringing the money. And, of course, we have a very long pipeline. And of course, our aspiration is to become the regional payment provider.</p><p>Well, now I'm certainly done with the payment part, and let me now switch to yet another ecosystem, the other initiative is housing. So why housing platform and how it's related to our strategy? Well, basically, the logic is same, right? So we need to be closer with our customers. And the real estate marketplace is offering huge opportunities and all the services it needs associated with it to get more engaged with it -- with the users and create the end-to-end journeys, basically to pool all off-line and online assets on one platform and create multiple combinations of the business models that would add value, right? Because in an environment where the digitization and connectivity expanding -- the old ways are no more working in terms of the value creation, so the new ways are really working to create value without any barriers.</p><p>So in terms of the scale, definitely scale is there. According to some forecast, by 2025, real estate marketplace is expected to generate around $3.8 trillion in terms of the turnover globally. By that time Georgia's estimate is $10 billion, whereas the current figure is trending around $3 billion. In terms of the market, for the Georgia realty at least, the market is quite fragmented, as Vakhtang mentioned. So of course, there are other players: the real estate developers, the buyers, sellers, brokers and many others, but they are disconnected. And the customer journey is very complicated. Our business model, our value proposition is totally different. So we are placing in the middle of our proposition data, and the building blocks around the data are the services, unique services, again, for the Georgia realty and we already launched [thousand] like the certified valuation service, first time ever available for the retail customers at a very accessible price, which they can have -- get in 24 hours and then use for multiple purposes like going into bank and asking for the financing right or the mortgage or for the tax purposes and so on and so forth.</p><p>The other one is Lead Generation. So this platform is already generating leads for the financial institutions, for the banks, for the real estate companies, and we're actually selling those leads. The public services, the insurance, again, the financing, we already have connected to banks apart from the TBC. And, of course, the sale, the most important layer of this value proposition of our business model, if you like, is the -- are the participants or stakeholders of this platform, right, who actually co-create the value together with us.</p><p>So in the pursuit of these challenge, early this year, we already made an acquisition of well-positioned startup company with a very promising management team. And since then, we did a rebranding, as you can see it's a new logo of the platform, Livo. We liked it quite. We already managed to do a new platform with a new design with an exceptional UI and UX, which is running at the BP Towers, and we just recently launched this platform. And we managed to set up a totally agile organization, self-directed teams for the each of the segments, which these parts are going to cover.</p><p>And in conclusion, let me share you our key targets. So by 2021, we plan to generate around $7.5 million in terms of the revenues by not investing more than $2 million over the 2-, 3-year period. But the revenues are not really the key factor that we are going after the housing ecosystem. The key is the data, right? The key is the customer patterns and behaviors that we're going to be able to aggregate and then use our data analytic capabilities to leverage on them further. Thank you very much.</p><p>AMIRAN SHEROZIA, HEAD OF IT, JSC TBC BANK: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on this event. My name is Amiran Sherozia. I am in charge of technology at TBC. However, today, I am not here to present how outstanding technological capabilities we have at the bank, but rather I am going to tell you amazing story of TBC venturing into e-commerce and what is the idea behind, what is the vision and what strategic aspirations we have for that particular venture.</p><p>So it started back in 2017 when I was thinking about financial inclusion, about open banking, open APIs and technology capabilities which we have at the bank. And I was thinking about how we can make financial services more accessible to our customers, how to leverage on our technologies and find innovative ways of being competitive on the market.</p><p>And then I realized that the -- we had to reimagine the way of providing services to the market and act not as a traditional bank, but rather as a big tech company who are disrupting the market and to provide the platform, which would connect different players on the market, providing different services and combining those services in order to make more integrated experience and services to end customers. And I approached Vakhtang with that idea, and Vakhtang financed this project, and now we have a new brand, Vendoo, which is on the market starting from May 2019.</p><p>So what is the business model behind? So it is a marketplace. This is the asset-light approach of moving to that business, and we are acting as an intermediary between different service providers and enabling the small and medium enterprises to sell their goods on the market and then provide the services across the country, throughout whole Georgia. And this strategy nicely fits to our strategic objectives to have 10 million users by 2022 and to act as a digital player on the market, to have many touch points with customers, to get more insights of customer behavior, their needs and leverage on these insights in different ways to our ecosystems.</p><p>So before moving to that, the project, before financing, we, of course, did the analysis of the market. So the GDP of Georgia is GEL 41 billion, and the retail spending of the -- in the economy is about GEL 10 billion. And our estimate is that about GEL 200 million should be the online potential of retail spending. And this was important for us to understand that the size of the market is enough to justify investment behind it, and I'll talk about that later.</p><p>But what is also interesting is another aspect which is specific to Georgia, the market -- the online market is not well developed. And the most of the Georgian citizens, they do shopping abroad. That means that they would buy things on global platforms, on Amazons, on eBays and the other kind of players and go to -- got those goods delivered, we are different [forward this] to Georgia. This is costly. It's timely. So it takes time to get the goods delivered and it also have barriers of language for customers. And we want to change that realty and change the ratio of online shopping abroad versus shopping in Georgia. And then what is also important that the market size is growing very fast. We see that it's approximately 45% on the yearly growth rate across different segments.</p><p>Also we did an analysis of local players who are on the market. Unfortunately for the market, but fortunately for us, there are no big players present in Georgia doing the same business, and there are small niche players who don't have either technology capabilities or some capital or resources to really change the market and then provide the services which is common elsewhere. And respectively, we see potential in doing that. However, our objective is not just to focus on local market after successful launch and then getting the knowledge and experience of doing this project in Georgia. We plan to move to other markets and replicate our technology capabilities and our expertise elsewhere.</p><p>So what does it mean to be an ecosystem player on the market? So we are providing to merchants e-commerce platform, it's a technology platform for them to upload their information on their products, on their catalogs and provide also services of digital marketing and provide traffic. And we are doing this through connecting different players. So this platform is not to act as a player on the market but to facilitate and interconnect different businesses so that they can enhance each other and provide these marketplace services. So we are partnering with different delivery companies, we are partnering with digital agencies and other companies who can provide these services to small and medium enterprises and enable them to scale up their sales online.</p><p>On the other hand, also we are focusing on retail customers, and we would love to provide the best-in-class services not available in Georgia due to the specifics of the market and to provide the best customer experience, very convenient services, ability to return goods back to the sellers, which is very complicated right now because you would need to move these goods back to different countries and then also breaking the barriers of language and, basically, changing the experience and changing the -- shopping habits in the market. And our vision is to make shopping and selling easy in Georgia and then do the same in similar other markets.</p><p>Now why it's interesting from a banking perspective? Why would a bank move into such a venture? Because we see big synergies in banking, between banking and marketplace. And particularly, we see that we are going to share quite a huge number of customers on both sides, on corporate and then small enterprises as well as on retail. And we are going to leverage our financial capabilities to credit ourselves through end customers to also understand better what customer needs are, what is their behavior and also incorporate that information into us calling and into better tailoring the offerings to end customers through making products and services really tailor-made and then personalized for each and every customer.</p><p>On the merchant side, we are going to leverage on our trade finance or our ethics capabilities, also provide our POS services, also let them participate in our loyalty system, which is very successful on the market, and then we see lots of synergies on both sides of the market.</p><p>So why do we think we are going to be competitive on the market? This is because we are going to compete on price-quality ratio. That means that we are going to eliminate delivery costs of getting goods delivered from overseas. We are going to eliminate the time of delivery of goods to Georgia because with the services we have already after 1 month of launch is that we are delivering goods in same day in Tbilisi and next day across all cities, all villages in Georgia, and we are working on that to make it even faster and to move to same-day delivery across the country.</p><p>Apart from that, also we would -- the Georgian citizens would benefit from different things like product return and Georgian language support, which are barriers for many of them, unfortunately, right now. On the merchant side, we are attracting merchants and providing them the good customer base, the good traffic and then we are establishing a strong brand on the market. We are providing out of box marketing, logistics, warehousing and other services. And also we are providing some advanced analytics capabilities for them to better manage their stocks and the deliveries and pricing and so on and so forth. So we believe it's going to be demanded on the market, and we already have more than 200 merchants on the platform right now and more than 6,000 SKUs already sold on the market.</p><p>And initially, to get started, we decided to acquire a discount coupons player on the market and use that company as a platform to then build on. And we also recruited best talent on the market and none of them are from banking industry. These are people from different online industries, from logistics and other areas of expertise. And I'm very proud that we have best talent right now. We started with 25 people acquiring this company, and right now we have about 100 people working day and night to make this venture success. And it is fully agile. It is -- we are adopting lean startup approaches. We are adopting cloud technologies and capabilities to be able to be fast and scalable and to provide best-in-class services for our customers.</p><p>This is about the distribution of spending, our retail spending in Georgia. This is our estimate. And you will see that about 45% is on food and grocery, and the rest is on other categories. And our strategy is to cover all categories except for grocery. And we started this year with electronics and personal care products, which accounts for 12% of the total market we are targeting. And right now we are also adding new categories on a daily basis. We are adding more than 200 products on the market. And by the end of this year, we are going to cover all key categories, and next years, we are going to move to apparel and shoes.</p><p>So what are the KPIs for this company, and how much it's cost us to invest in this venture? So we are investing $3 million over a 2.5-year period. We expect breakeven to be in 2020, and we expect a number of sales to be about 0.5 million by the end of the term and to reach 40 million gross merchandise volume.</p><p>And for next steps, this year, we are planning to add new categories, the gardening, home, toys, et cetera. And by the end of this year, also launching mobile application, which is very important for customers to shop because the behavior is that most of people, they would search products via mobile and then do the transaction on laptops and computers. And next year, we are also launching some innovation application, innovative applications, and also we would decide whether to move to other countries and in which countries to target and how to replicate our success in other places.</p><p>This is all about this ecosystem. Thank you very much.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, gentlemen. The next presenter is Nikoloz Kurdiani, Head of our MSME Banking, and he will talk about our full digital bank space.</p><p>NIKOLOZ KURDIANI, DEPUTY CEO OF MSME BANKING, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Hello, everybody. Thanks for coming and listening to this very interesting presentation. I'm happy to present an update on Space, which is one of those projects which positions TBC as one of the best innovator and technology companies in our region. We presented Space last year as an idea basically, and now I will show you a bit more after 1 year of its operations, almost 1 year. I have a special slide on age.</p><p>So the first question is what is Space? And basically, the next slide will be about why Space is, in our opinion, successful and well positioned. It's a fully cloud-based solution. Everything we've developed is basically on cloud, on Amazon Web Services. We created Space so that it supports our international expansion and basically helps us in entering new markets. It had to be very easy to integrate because, basically, how we operate in Georgia, as you may know, is we integrated ourselves with TBC core banking system. So if we enter a new market, we also have to integrate ourselves easily into other core banking solutions or other partner companies. It is a fully in-house solution and very flexible. What I call flexible is that it is modular and fully API-based. I have a special slide on the architecture. And one of the core requirements, basically, was time-to-market, and I will show you later on what we achieved in that regard.</p><p>Basically, the next question is why we think basically -- why do we need Space and why we created Space? And the main thing is that we wanted to create a challenger for ourselves. Basically, we, in Georgia, as you know, already are one of the biggest players, and we have the leading position in retail market. And we just wanted to challenge the processes and customer journeys which we have, and maybe to come up with another alternative way of doing the same but easier or maybe more simpler. And so we are basically competing with ourselves in this regard. Also what we wanted to do, as we are a big institution and with lots of -- I cannot call it legacy because we are, altogether, almost 30 years old, not that old. But legacy systems, we wanted to alternate the IT architecture to see something which may be operating with a different logic and to create a platform for international expansion.</p><p>On this slide, yes, I mean this slide basically shows very simply the architecture logic. What we used from TBC Group, TBC Bank, basically, was the core banking, but to its minimum extent. Basically, we just took the general ledger functional, the account holding functional and reporting to the National Bank, and all the rest is built around in the middleware. So all the products, their core functional, core features are in the middleware. All the third-party solutions are connected to that middleware. So whatever we want to change and change it quickly because the customers require the changes quickly, we would do this in the middleware. So we will not touch the core banking solution, which is a monolith. So changing the core banking solution, as you may have heard already, is quite difficult. This is what exactly is called the legacy systems, and nobody wants to touch them basically. So that's why in Space, we just keep very minimum from the core and all the rest is in the layers around. So basically, everything is autonomous and modular and fully based on APIs.</p><p>Yes, moving on. There are 3 main things, which in our opinion makes Space different or unique in our market. And as we're expanding to the neighboring markets also on those, it's the quick time-to-market, and I will show you what I mean in that a bit later on.</p><p>UX and UI, so this is very important. I mean in reality, we know many different products, which basically sell themselves because they are better designed or they have a better customer journey. I won't mention famous names and brands, but we all know what I'm talking about. And instant service delivery. Instant, the word instant becomes very important nowadays because people do not want to spend more time on various processes. It's not only about banking, right? In everything, people would want things to be quick right away, instant, and this is also applied massively to banking and we know many examples in U.K. or in other markets where this thing is becoming very, very important.</p><p>I will show you now 2 very small demos, very quick ones. The first one is how we do the payment, a P2P transfer; and the second one is about loan. And this is -- we just recorded it very simply on the screen, and this is a reality, how quickly one would do those. Yes, this is a payment. Choosing the card from which we want to transfer, choosing the card to which we want to transfer, taking the amount, checking list, and that's it. This is how quickly you transfer the money basically from any cards to any card. And this is the confirmation SMS, basically, we received that the transaction was done.</p><p>And this is how we take a loan. Loan amount; repayment date; payment amount, so that it would calculate the maturity afterwards; checking into the revenue service, so that we estimate the salary; we receive the unique code, the allowance to check; terms, the contract basically; card we want to transfer the loan to. It can be also a non-Space or non-TBC card. We could directly transfer to our competitors' cards; and that's it, the loan is disbursed. So everything is done instantly. And this is exactly what I say, basically, when I say instant because the customer should not be spending time on getting the loan. The loan amount is up to GEL 25,000 at this point, and which is something about $9,000. And yes, I'll show you the figures afterwards.</p><p>This is the slide about the age. Space is 8 months old. So what I call 8 months old is from the moment we closed the beta. We said that now we are not a beta application anymore. And basically, this is the time line. So in February 2017, we had the idea. In July, we approved -- in June, we approved it. In January, we had the prototype in 2018. And in March, we had an app testing. We called it Friends and Family. Beta was launched in May and in September, early October, we closed it. So afterwards, basically, this is where (inaudible) and these are the results.</p><p>So ever since the moment of the launch, basically, we had 397,000 downloads, so the app downloads. We have, for today, I just checked, it's almost 130,000 registered customers, so this slides represents an earlier date. We have 15,000 daily active customers. We have 64,000 issued cards, 572,000 transactions performed ever since, 9,000 borrowers and the loan portfolio is of -- I mean these days, is a bit more than GEL 20 million already.</p><p>So I would say the results are quite impressive for 8 months, for a younger baby basically. And the next steps -- the only purpose of this slide is to show this. The next steps are Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. So what we -- Giorgi will be telling you more about the Uzbekistani project, where we use Space as a banking -- as a service platform. In Azerbaijan, we want to enter with Space the way we entered Georgia basically with Space, using Nikoil as the core banking solution provider.</p><p>Thanks a lot. This was the update.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thanks, Niko. So after our digital initiatives, we are now turning towards our international plans. First up is Azerbaijan. So I'd like to invite the CEO of Nikoil Bank, Nikoloz Shurgaia.</p><p>NIKOLOZ N. SHURGAIA, CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD, NIKOIL INVESTMENT COMMERCIAL BANK OJSC: So hello, everybody. I'm Nikoloz Shurgaia. I thank Mamuka for the presentation earlier. A few more words is I'm a Georgian and British banker, International. I worked in -- I lived and worked in 5 countries already: here in London; my home, Georgia; Russia; Belarus and for the last 7 years in Azerbaijan. And Azerbaijan has attracted me with its fascinating opportunities, and has never failed to keep me fascinated. I'm here to tell you about Azerbaijan as the country, which I love; about Nikoil Bank, partner of TBC; and our joint plans to expand in Azerbaijan.</p><p>This slide is somewhat loaded with data. I will not bore you with the specs. Three key points. First is we are small but fast-growing. We take governance, management, good practices very seriously, and we have high ambitions. We've been hiring 30, 40 people every month. And sorry -- 30, 40 people every month, and this resulted in over 50% of our staff working with us less than a year, so this is a very young and dynamic energetic team. Very good graduates, I'm proud to see them, meet them every month and be part of the introduction program and see how good talent is coming. I'm thinking as a younger banker of myself, representing minority, less than 10% of people who are over 45 years old. So this is a very highly energetic bank and happy to drive forward and actually, we gel together very well.</p><p>And we are very much like the country where we operate. Azerbaijan is a young country. It has been I think, 1 million population every decade. So it has reached last year, 10 million. And the economy is solid, $45 billion GDP, 3.4% growth, and a lot of good macroeconomic indicators, huge reserves in the oil fund and so on. And the country had gone through a crisis in 2015-2017, which was a very good, very healthy wakeup call. So the country -- the leadership, political leadership, has started a lot of very strong initiative to drive growth. The country is already on 25th place in ease of doing business, and it's advancing fast. The country introduced a new tax system, reduced significantly the rates applicable to salaries and improved tremendously the administration.</p><p>Recently returned significant amount of taxes paid earlier and just paid back. This was inconceivable 5, 6 years ago. We see very good improvements in the judiciary, many new judges appointed, reshuffled. Their pay has increased so there is a very strong moral upper ground to keep things clean. Then we see a lot of very competent, young people coming, going to the West, returning, and many competent technocrats taking positions in state-owned enterprises and in the cabinet, and they are driving further reforms.</p><p>We are very fortunate to be in the environment, which is -- which has low credit penetration. Loans to GDP ratio is 16%. And by any dimension result, Azerbaijan has actually deliveries even though never has reached huge levels throughout the crisis years. So we have a fantastic opportunity to grow credit. And the economy needs it and household needs it and expect it from the banking sector.</p><p>There are 30 banks in the country. We have identified this -- broken down this into 3 groups. First is 3 larger banks, which are between 11% to 16% market share. Then we've identified 5 peer banks to us which are closest competitors, all have -- all but 1 have foreign capital. And 22 other banks. These 22 are varying lots, not to be neglected. But these 5 are the closest competitors at the moment. They have bigger customer base, they started earlier, digital initiatives and so on, better brands. But we are, by far, not intimidated. We are full of energy and enthusiasm and we feel that we have so many strong initiatives that we will surpass very soon. Our ambition, I set quite high, is today the largest privately owned bank in the country with foreign capital. This is approximately being fourth-largest, and we want to be the most profitable.</p><p>What drives us? This is the key. As I said, we take governance and good management very seriously. We want to build digital ecosystems very much like TBC, and this TBC's partnership is huge, help and inspiration. Our vision is to be the brand of choice of Azerbaijani people who aspire better -- who are looking for better banking and services. And what our values are: put the customer first; serve with a heart; find solutions; keep it simple; and work with a smile. And the distinguishing factors are, we are focusing on micro SME and people of Azerbaijan. Three factors which will distinguish us are: firstly, good governance and the inspired team; important is -- second is technology, where we are applying most modern technologies; and third is best-in-class customer experience, which we build using the best international practice.</p><p>What are our preferred sales channels? Digital, of course. However, digital is, at the moment, not a huge earner. We started relatively late. We invest a lot now and we will be catching up, I'm very confident. However, at the moment, key is the branch network. We are keen not to expand bricks-and-mortar investments to shut it down later. So our strategy is to keep our branches rather small size, 12 branches across the country, 8 of them in Baku. But we are expanding partners networks, one of them is TBC Capital, which we take as our own, and we are one single. However, that's a very much lower-cost expansion because TBC can open small branches without cash desks, 3, 4 people per branch located in very smart locations, convenient locations. And we are selling convenience to our customers.</p><p>And second pillar, we just started making launch, not only via TBC -- but actually, we had experience with another partner, already 200 points of sales experience, points of sales with Fintrend, their local technology company. They are in retail areas. Now TBC Kredit expansion, and we have lined out to very good solid partners with whom we would go beyond 1,000 points of sale.</p><p>The governance. Every layer of the bank's governance is very efficient. We are proud to be supported and very strongly supported by Mr. Alekperov, President of Lukoil, as the key shareholder of the bank. Our Supervisory Board has 3 members: Marina Kulishova, present in this room. And I'm happy to work with her, probably the best boss in my career, very inspiring, empowering, with strong character and able to find solutions with her knowledge of the market, with her contacts when it is most needed; Nik Enukidze, you know him, all of you or most of you, and Nik is a seasoned banker. We have known each other for a long time, and I'm happy to collaborate with him, and it has been -- brought a lot of solid e-tail banking experience to our Board. And Ivan Romanovskiy, who is a very smart business person and personal adviser to Mr. Alekperov.</p><p>Apart from the Board, then comes management board, of which I will tell you a bit later. And in addition to the Management Board and the traditional committees which we see in similar banks, we have established a new body, governing body, which is Steering Committee. It's composed of Nikoil Bank Board members and Vakhtang and Nika, I'm really grateful to you, gentlemen, for bringing big thinking, a lot of positive energy and many smart ideas. I do appreciate this, and my team appreciates this. This is a very, very good collaboration of hearts and minds.</p><p>This is the team. 8 people -- 9, I'm sorry, 8 apart from me, and very diverse. Although this is all male but we have Marina as head, a female, and the bank has 36% plus female employees, and there is more kind of diversity. 4 of this strong executives are Georgian, 4 Azerbaijani. I'm somewhere in between. I have really 7 years in Azerbaijan and I brought a lot, so I'm, with my heart Georgian, but I take everything good from the countries I live, and this is a great combination. Some of the people have worked with me for 6 years in the bank I managed previously: Farkhad, Arif; Fuad is the only one who remembers from the old management, and he has brought with him continuity and he has changed role to adjust to the bank from a CFO and Chief Digital Officer to now Chief Head of Retail; and 4 new people, which have made impact from the very beginning, I very much appreciate; and Avtandil is the last. He was deputy to Amiran. And I feel now we have a very solid digital person to guide; and David, another digital -- we have divided digital into 2 areas. So one is customer experience and the other, internal digital applications. So both areas, this kind of dream people to work with.</p><p>Our core business is relatively simple. It's taking deposits, making loans. But we have very smart -- several very smart, for the market, new products. Loans, we distinguish ourselves with convenience. So loans, which -- not Space yet, but loans, which we make under 15 minutes and up to 50,000 monetary hit. And we sell it from our network and from partner networks. We have several other interesting features. One is a very popular savings product connected to a business card. Also we are developing partner merchant networks to lay foundations for the future, more digital, wider initiatives. There are several strong tools, which will be unveiled very soon, and my heart is full of excitement with this.</p><p>First is our new brand. We've lived with Nikoil Bank happily, but we'll have a very, very customer-friendly and with very international connotation brand ready to be launched this month. Its attributes have been approved just yesterday, our final attributes. But we'll test it in the market. And so I'm full of anticipation. It has been developed by British, very prominent creative agency, Winkreative. And then we have a very modern for Azerbaijan, miles ahead, new branch network -- new branch design, and we will open first branch in September, it's -- but we started already renovation. And then our ability to underwrite loans very efficiently via customer networks. So -- and many other, I would not go in new headquarters and many, many initiatives.</p><p>TBC has been very helpful in this. I mentioned Vakhtang and Nika, but many others, thank you all for your assistance. Firstly, it was strategy, new strategy formation and then making this team together and adding new very solid team members and a lot of help on the operating level. It's a good inspiration for our people to visit Tbilisi and learn from the colleagues, and also we very much welcome TBC team coming to Azerbaijan. And we collaborate very well. It's a more kind of really partnership from heart. I strongly appreciate this.</p><p>Key financials. I'm very happy and proud to come to profitability, finally, after 2.5 years of restructuring and fighting with the legacy. And the last quarter numbers are very good. We are still operating -- operationally loss-making. We could become profitable operationally sooner, but we decided to grow faster. This is our preference to acquire profit us, and this will come in the first -- the profitability will come in the first half of the next year. Deposits have not been growing, but it was intentional. We've had much capital to utilize. The loans are growing very fast, loan disbursements. And net interest margin is also improving.</p><p>Our medium-term targets are: our net loan book is $150 million. So we want to increase it 10x over the next 2.5 years to hit $1.4 billion. Our equity, $36 million and we want to come as high as $200 million. And the return on equity, we will be, this year, in small single-digit, but we want to come to 20% plus very soon.</p><p>I do appreciate your attention, and thank you. I feel that I'm very much in the right place, right time. The economy is growing very well. I've done 4 bank turnarounds earlier. And it was always set to counterpart with my behavior, and this is the great opportunity to bring it to the next level of development. It's a huge new territory for me, and it's a great excitement to be here in this country with these teams and partners. So I hope this small story was not boring. And I will be here to answer your questions. Marina is also here. And we would very much welcome you to Baku to visit us and learn more about us. Thank you very much.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Nikoloz. Last presentation before the break, it's Giorgi with the Uzbek story.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE, CFO, DEPUTY CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Good afternoon, everyone. Again, thank you very much for coming and joining us today. I'll speak about financials right after the break. But now I'm going to discuss Uzbekistan. And it's an amazing story. We have, I think, 18 slides. I'll try to show this story. It's not working. Anyway, so I'll try here.</p><p>The first is some facts about Uzbekistan. This is the most populous country in Central Asia. The number of population is about 33 million. This is very rich with the natural resources. It's in the top places in gold, in copper, in natural gas and in cotton as well.</p><p>Some more data. The GDP is about $41 billion. GDP per capital is about $1,300. International reserves, $28 billion. Uzbekistan was recently rated by Fitch as BB-, and about 2 months ago, they issued the first government Sovereign Bond, which we hear was about 8x oversubscribed.</p><p>Why Uzbekistan is interesting for us, and then we are trying to explain it here. The first is its obviously very large and underpenetrated market. I have a slide giving this in more details. But the penetration of retail segment is 7%, with the population again being 33 million and growing by around 500,000 per year.</p><p>The second one is similarities with Georgia. Obviously, we share some similar past in -- during the Soviet, plus there are mainly reforms right now being implemented in Uzbekistan that resembles that of Georgia, and plus both countries are basically painting -- are being painted in the China's One Belt One Road initiative.</p><p>The next is right time from the reform perspective. I mean there was leadership change. There are many momentum, there are many reforms. Two of them that I could highlight is the, one, tax reform; and the other one is unpegging the currency rate.</p><p>Some more data from Uzbekistan and they will be important when I start discussing the strategy and approach. The first is the penetration of the smartphones. This is 15%. Then we put it in the context of the several other countries. The card penetration is 24%, so quite -- not low, and -- plus Internet penetration, 52%. So this is important when we speak about the strategy.</p><p>On this slide, I wanted to show some data on the projections and the performance of the economy. Now the first is how the country has grown so far. And then we are comparing it to the CIS countries and to Georgia. And then you can see that the growth rate has been at least highest -- at least the same with Giorgia, but mostly higher. The going-forward, and this is IMF projection, we see that Uzbekistan -- IMF's view about the Uzbekistan growth, that it will outperform CIS countries and even Georgia. Public debt to GDP is around 25%. In terms of average GDP growth over the 2019-2024 period, again, this is still, again, IMF focused, it will be 5.8%, right above Georgia.</p><p>Now there are some other facts that our macro team identified, which are very interesting. The 2/3 of Uzbekistan exports are in commodities such as gold and natural gas, cotton and copper. Now the interesting fact here is that these commodities are not very highly correlated to one another, which means that the growth will be stable and consistent as we saw in the past. Now we are seeing, in addition to that, we are seeing that more higher value-added goods such as chemicals, cars, fruit and vegetable products and, more recently, textiles, to be basically a big thing in the Uzbekistan economy.</p><p>Now with regards of what we are -- the loan -- sorry, the banking sector, and the sector is pretty much owned -- 85% of the sector is the government banks -- government-owned banks still or state-owned banks. I'll speak on the next slide. But loan to GDP is 50%. Now that includes the government-owned bank and the state-owned banks and loans to the state-owned companies. But if we think about the mortgage loans to GDP, it is 4.2%, way low across the peer countries. And nonmortgage loans to GDP, and that would apply to retail, it is 3.1%. So very, very low. Now here, we can see that the retail loan to GDP is about 7.3%.</p><p>In terms of banking sector itself, we have again state-owned banks, which are the largest. They have about 86% in the assets and similar number in the loans. And these are the so-called commercial banks, so not state-owned banks, they have about, respectively, 15%. We're seeing some foreign ownership, it's ownership in the Kapital. We saw two, Ziraat Bank Uzbekistan from Turkey, Halyk Bank just got the full license for the operation.</p><p>Now what we are going to do in Uzbekistan is quite unique and I'll try to discuss it here. It will be digital bank with smart branches. It will be next-generation bank and it will be based on Space. So we will be using Space as a platform, obviously we will have the core banking and all the local -- to meet all the local requirements, but the front end will be Space and it will have smarter branches. Our targeted shareholder structure is that 51% will belong to TBC. We have local partner, currently it is UzOman Fund, and we have achieved agreement on the main terms with the fund, and 40% we target to offer IFIs, EBRD and IFC have expressed interest and let's see how it goes.</p><p>In terms of further detail about our greenfield digital bank, we will invest, in the first stage, it will be $20 million, $30 million and then we expect our partner shareholders to match this investment with a similar amount. This is the target loan book and this is in the medium term after the establishment. Obviously, we'll start with consumer. We'll copy what we have in Space in Georgia, fine tune for the Uzbek reality and we'll start with consumer, then it will be mortgages, and finally it will be SME. Over time, SME share will even further increase.</p><p>Now in the context or within the strategy what we have in Uzbekistan, again establishing greenfield digital bank, we moved on and we acquired PayMe. This is payment ecosystem on payment platform in Uzbekistan, the best in the country, and I would say in the region, with 1.3 million customers profitable and growing. The PayMe is the ecosystem that connects consumers, merchants and banks, providing payment solutions, such as utility payments, top-ups, the e-commerce acquirer -- acting as an acquirer and innovates and goes on. And then most people I meet within Uzbekistan, they kind of were saying that they do have PayMe and then they are everyday users of PayMe.</p><p>Again, financial numbers with PayMe is very important. This is startup, but this is the startup with already good financial performance. The revenue grew by 21% in quarter 1, this is quarter-over-quarter number. Net profit grew by 73% in quarter 1 and number of customers it is 1.3 million, it's already 1.4 million, by the way now, and it's grew by 14% in quarter-over-quarter.</p><p>One of the advantages or competencies that we acquired with the PayMe acquisition is that we aligned with the management of PayMe and then they will be staying with us, sharing the long-term growth and long-term strategy. And then these are the people who established the business. They are currently 59% owners of PayMe and they have long-term commitment. We are right now developing the...</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: 49.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: 49 -- sorry, 49% obviously, and we are right now developing the new strategy with the management. We will have many innovations, many things that we will take from Georgia obviously many things from the world. Some innovations might include money transfers, cards, wallets, loyalty cards, instant checkouts or ticketing solutions and many more, but this is again profitable growing company.</p><p>Now back to our initiative in the bank, we are expecting to receive license, banking license, which is obviously subject to many procedural things and plus approvals and confirmations from the respective authorities. But just before we receive the license, we have not been losing the time and we launched 3 work streams and then we are working on these 3 work streams. The first is deployment of Space and this is important because it takes lots of time to make and ensure that Space is up and running, is connected to the local core banking, is connected with the local infrastructure and et cetera. So we started this, we are moving on and this is being done. And our target is that in September this year, Space will be operationally ready.</p><p>The second work stream is branch. And then as I said, this is smart branch, we would call it next-generation digital branch. It is not expensive, it's actually even cheap. It's in a small place, equipped with self-service and assisted service terminals, more like an Apple store rather than traditional banking branch. This is the real branch that we have actually in Uzbekistan already ready to operate. And then the idea here is that the user experience and design of applications, which will be running on those self-service and assisted service terminals will be exactly the same as it will be running on the mobile, Internet, iPad or you name it. So the purpose of the branch is that among basically explaining the customers about the products and selling the products, to walk the customer through the designs, so next time customer want something same, it will do by its own -- or by himself or herself using just the gadget.</p><p>And then the third one is obviously assembling the team and it's very important, this is very time-consuming exercise and we've started it. We are lucky we have 2 senior level support: one from Vano Baliashvili. Vano has been with the bank for many, many years, with TBC for many, many years as Chief Operating Officer. So he is helping us to set up the operation; another one, Archil Dzodzuashvili, so he has played as chief -- he has working experience as a Chief Risk Officer in Kaspi Bank in Kazakhstan, which is the retail bank. We have 2 TBC team members, Rostom and Nika, that agreed with us to move to Uzbekistan and the rest of the team is being collected locally. We have Chief Commercial Officer, who we already recruited, Chief Legal Officer, Head of HR and Chief Accountant. So that would be the team that -- who shares the values and the ambition with us to change the banking system pretty much in Uzbekistan.</p><p>So this is it about Uzbekistan. After the Q&amp;A now, we will have the break. To conclude my presentation, over time we want our Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan businesses to reach about 30% of TBC Group.</p><p>So I think we'll do Q&amp;A of the first session and...</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Yes. So I guess, it probably makes sense to ask questions about what has been heard in the last 2 hours. So please feel free. Some hands up down there. All right, please?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROBERT MURPHY, HEAD OF INVESTMENT TRUSTS, EDISON INVESTMENT RESEARCH LIMITED: Rob Murphy, Edison. Could you talk about the underwriting process for lending in the new Uzbek and Azerbaijani regions? Sorry, sorry. Could you talk about the loan underwriting process and how that will work in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan?</p><p>NIKOLOZ N. SHURGAIA: So with respect to Azerbaijan, we have a new -- we have paid attention to underwriting early on and we have since late 2018 a new Chief Risk Officer, previously one of the senior risk officers and then later retail managers at TBC, David Tediashvili, and he is a great contributor to this. So we have been geared to create this opportunity to underwrite very fast our own loans and loans which we make via partner networks. We have been working for a partner for already over a year. So this has been very well tested. We have a young, but well-trained team, expanding it fast. And we are able to finish the process from application to disbursement, in -- under 15 minutes. I have to admit that under 15 minutes is a target, firstly, not always reached, but then on the other side, we have an ambition to do it much faster. We are now working, we have the Steering Committee, one of the goals is to bring it to 5, 7 minutes and people are very ambitious and happy to work on this. And this is very, very important because we do not want to invest in bricks and mortar, and also we want to switch to data-enabled digital banking very soon. So this is just a stepping stone to that direction.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: I mean in Uzbekistan, underwriting process will leverage from TBC's knowledge, again the consultant that we have from the experience with Kaspi Bank. Obviously, it will be scoring based, there is a local credit info. But I guess, the one point is very important, because of the very low penetration, if you act fast and if you move on fast, you get the best customers, then best customers will be best credit customers as well.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: All right. Anthony?</p><p>ANTHONY DA-COSTA, ANALYST, PEEL HUNT LLP, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Anthony Da-Costa, Peel Hunt. The first question is on the Uzbekistan's smart branches. How many are you sort of looking to have, and will you be adopting this approach in Azerbaijan with smart branches?</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: I mean for the first stage, we'll have something between 25 and 50, it depends how fast we can generate the interest, but I guess, the point on the smart branches are they are very cheap and then you need about 1.5 months from locating the location to move on and start operations. So there is no cash there. You just ship the equipment. You saw that this design is quite simple. So I mean we are not afraid with these branches. You can make mistakes, you can open the branch. If you find out that this was mistakenly opened, you just relocate it in there. In Azerbaijan, I think...</p><p>NIKOLOZ N. SHURGAIA: In Azerbaijan, we have recruited the same London-based team to help us design our branches. We have already a sizable operation, so we are just changing our existing branches. We have 12 own branches at Nikoil. We are not going to increase it significantly. However, this year we will open 13 new TBC Kredit branches. First one has opened and started making loans last week, and well, 30 more will come -- 29 more will come during this year, very, very fast. And it's a very good efficient operation. I very much look forward to opening our new changed own branch in September, which will be very big stepping stone for unveiling the new brand.</p><p>ANTHONY DA-COSTA: Is the branding Space in both countries, also in Nikoil?</p><p>NIKOLOZ N. SHURGAIA: In Azerbaijan, we have invested in our own digital bank, which will start in September. However, Space will run in parallel and these are gateway as very much like TBC. TBC has -- I am a user, I love it, TBC's mobile bank and I live in Azerbaijan. And I think I do not want to say the names, but I have British banks as well, and I think TBC is better as a user. And in Azerbaijan, Space will be geared towards younger customer segments, but we have also our own.</p><p>NIKOLOZ KURDIANI: I have a comment about branding. So in Uzbekistan, we would apply for Space banking-as-a-service platform, where the brand will be TBC. Basically, TBC would white label Space. In Azerbaijan, we would apply the model which we operate in Georgia, where Space is an independent player with its own branding. So in Georgia, Space will be just linked to TBC as a core banking provider, but branding wise and customer-facing-wise will be independent based on Space. In Uzbekistan, it's TBC brand based on platform, which is provided by Space, so white label.</p><p>ANTHONY DA-COSTA: And then in terms of the housing, sphere or there was a term you used -- yes, ecosystem, you talked about sort of this revenue target, I don't have the slides on me, where is that revenue coming from exactly?</p><p>TORNIKE GOGICHAISHVILI: Good question. So during my presentation, I mentioned that we have already launched the services. So one of the unique services we are currently offering is the valuation service, so the certified valuation. And we are offering that service not only to the private individuals, but to the financial institutions and to real estate developers and so on and so forth. The other source, basically the source of the revenues are the services that are going to be available on this ecosystem, the lead generation, which is very popular now and not only the banks, but again real estate developers are buying, and many others like the public services and insurance, the financing and et cetera. So basically the services that are going to be offered on the sites are going to generate the revenue, particularly for the ecosystem. Vakhtang?</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: Just to end on this application, so this application is open. What I mean by that is that you can find the mortgages not only for TBC Bank, but also from other banks. Tornike mentioned the insurance. So you can find the insurance products for the -- on the application not from the TBC Insurance, but also -- so we think that all the applications and all the ecosystems which will be offered from our side, it has to be open ended, it has to be done for the other banks or the other corporates. So this is an open system we are building.</p><p>ANTHONY DA-COSTA: Will you charge the other banks a fee for going through?</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: For the ecosystem, we charge.</p><p>ANTHONY DA-COSTA: And then the final question is on Vendoo. You spoke about 10 million users. I was trying to work up, where these users come from? Because -- I mean obviously Georgia has 3.7 million of population.</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: No, no, no. 10 million users, I meant in my presentation totally by 2022. I mean the users in Georgia, I meant users in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan as a bank -- users of the banking products, but also users of the ecosystems everywhere and all the systems, not only the banking users.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: All right. Andrew?</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY, HEAD OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, SBERBANK CIB INVESTMENT RESEARCH: I am Andrew Keeley from Sberbank. I suppose Badri and Giorgi, I suppose, several of you in fact spoke about basically Georgia as a very fast economic growth, regional hub for the plans for the kind of country. But at the same time, obviously your business over the next few years, you are increasingly looking to -- the growth is going to be coming from Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you see the growth opportunities, particularly I suppose for lending within Georgia over the next few years? And I guess, particularly given it seems like increasing regulatory pressure and concern about quite high penetration there? And I have another question after.</p><p>VAKHTANG BUTSKHRIKIDZE: Yes. So as I -- as we mentioned in our presentation, our medium-term target for the loan growth is 10% to 15%. But segment by segment, we are forecasting different growth in Georgia. You know you're right that from the beginning of this year, we have regulations on the retail side and probably this year will be less growth. We are forecasting in the range of, I think, within the 12 to 24 months, the growth will be in the range of 10%. But in other segments, especially in the micro and SME business, we are forecasting much higher growth in the range of 15% to 20%, 25%, and the corporate business also we believe that it's a high growth opportunities. But on the other hand, we are expanding for our investment banking, and George will make a presentation in the second part of this day and you will see what kind of opportunities we see there. On the one hand, it decreases our growth on the corporate side, on the loan side, but on the other hand, we are expanding our businesses in the investment -- as investment bank.</p><p>BADRI JAPARIDZE: Just to add that, of course, our core business remains in Georgia, and we will grow there and we will diversify our services. And therefore, when we are talking about expansion outside of Georgia, this is not at expense of the development in Georgia. Within Georgia, we are developing and we will continue. But we took a chance to develop in Azerbaijan and in Uzbekistan because of several reasons. In Azerbaijan, we found strong, reliable partner, and we believe that with the digital platform, with limited exposure, we can tap the opportunities in Azerbaijan together with our partner. And in Uzbekistan because country has opened up and so underpenetrated, with our technologies, with our expertise we -- the same approach with limited exposure, asset-light approach, we can tap also the opportunity in Uzbekistan. But again, these are the complementary to the developments within Georgia. This is my answer.</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY: And obviously, you've got a lot of going on in terms of your ecosystem development in payments and housing and e-commerce. And I guess, this should feed into pretty strong fee income growth. If you could just get some thoughts about -- obviously, fee income has been a very strong driver of your revenues over the last few years. How you see the fee income kind of potential going forward? And maybe as well just whether you have any kind of comments on how you see your revenue or profitability split between kind of core -- kind of banking business and kind of these new kind of nonbanking segments?</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Yes. I mean you are right that will support the fee income generation. Even though they are -- from the financials perspective for now, they are very small and then the investment we have been making with them has been quite limited. Therefore, our fee income growth for the medium term stays -- our guidance stays 20%-plus, and over time obviously it will increase the fee contribution, given the margins decrease. But what's very important is that it increases customer loyalty, customer stickiness. We have customer data, customer relationship. And of course, in the longer term, this will be different, we will see higher fee income and again higher opportunities for growth. In the medium term, we are not changing the guidance.</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY: Very fine. Very quick question. You talked about 10 million customers in 2022, what do you have currently?</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Users? We have 2.5 million...</p><p>NIKOLOZ KURDIANI: Plus 1.3 million.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Plus 1.3 million in Uzbekistan.</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY: 3.8 million basically.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: We are catching up with the counting. But yes, so we are roughly 4 million.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Any more questions before the break. Mikhail?</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV, EQUITIES\u00c2\u00a0ANALYST, VTB CAPITAL, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mikhail Shlemov, VTB Capital. As you have been trying to allocate more and more capital into the new businesses, and especially the targets which you are giving there for long-term by 2022, how you are thinking about those businesses going forward, should they be staying as part of big TBC group, so it will be becoming, let's say, part of regional franchise with also advanced digital capabilities or you would be open to the idea of actually splitting out those businesses, and for example, make them a separate possibly listed companies?</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: We will clearly control those businesses and -- but we will be working with the partners to ensure that we fine tune the offers with the local needs. We don't have plans to list these businesses separately. In theory, you would never exclude that big market such as Uzbekistan, and the big exposure there can be separately listed and floating, in the context that TBC maintains 51%.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Okay. Any last question before the break? All right. Let's break for 20 minutes. That's coffee, tea and drinks outside.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: All right, welcome back. I think we'll start the second half. I think Giorgi, our CFO, is back on stage with the financials.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Thank you. Thank you, again. Welcome back. I'll start now the financial presentation. This would be about the quarter 1. Also we'll bring some numbers from the 2018. Let me start with highlighting our financial performance. Firstly, we had very strong growth in loan book, 22.9%. We will have some impact on the growth from new regulation, I'll discuss it afterwards, but just before we get there, our loan growth has been about 23%. We had net profit growth about 36.7%, reaching GEL 133 million in quarter 1. Return on equity, significant increase by 2.8 percentage points year-on-year reaching 23.8%. Net fee and commission income continues to grow up to 20%, reaching about GEL 42 million, cost to income further improvement about 40 basis points and all these basically resulted into the improvement -- further improvement in earnings per share. For the quarter, it is roughly 39% increase.</p><p>Now if I start with the growth and some more numbers, this is about loan book. You can see that year-on-year our growth in the loan book was 22.9%. Again, this growth was mainly reached by the growth in SME and corporate book. We did not have high growth rate in retail, mainly due to the new regulation, which restricts the growth to certain customers above certain thresholds of payment-to-income and loan-to-value. The growth in deposit portfolio was more or less consistent, if we speak, year-on-year and achieved 20.4%. In terms of quarter-over-quarter, we saw retail deposit decrease related to -- partially related to seasonality and partially related to new regulation as well.</p><p>Profitability, it is on this slide. The profit for the year -- for the quarter grew by 37 -- 36.7%, reaching again GEL 133 million. The profit for the quarter, quarter-over-quarter grew by 2.5%, but this is very seasonal. So in fact, the quarterly growth of the profit would not indicate anything. Return on equity, quarter 1 return on equity, quarter 1 2019 was 23.8%, quarter 1 2018 was 21%, again 2.8 percentage point improvement. Here too quarter-over-quarter number would not give much, given the seasonality.</p><p>Net interest margin, actually it continues -- net interest margin in quarter 1 decreased by about 60 basis point quarter-over-quarter. Now about 50 basis point from this decrease was related to new regulation, again this regulation limits the growth or actually restricts the growth about certain thresholds of payment-to-income and loan-to-value ratios and that decreased yields on such retail customers plus decreases the portion of consumer loans into the retail portfolio or total portfolio. That said, it has a good impact on cost of risk, which improvement in cost of risk mainly offsets the effect or nearly offsets the effect plus we are not revising our profitability guidance. As Vakhtang said, we target 20%-plus and we feel comfortable there.</p><p>Yields on loans and securities cost of deposits, you can see on this slide. I mean again the yields on loans, the decline in yields on loans is due to the same regulation. We saw slight increase in cost of deposit. This was more related to de-dollarization of deposits and more dollar deposits, which is obviously good news.</p><p>Fee and commission income, this is on this slide, again, continues to grow 20% -- up to 20% year-on-year. Quarter-over-quarter is very seasonal. In quarter 4, we do have high fee and commission income. Year-on-year, 20% growth is pretty much across the board except settlement transaction, which still grew. We see good growth in guarantees and letter of credit. We see good growth in card operation and overall across all operations.</p><p>Noninterest income grew by 18.5%, more or less consistent with the fee and commission income. The largest growth here is related to gains from FX operations. This is called in the accounting as gains from FX operations. In reality, this is the profit that we generate from the transaction of FX.</p><p>Asset quality continues to be very stable and strong. Our NPLs are broadly stable. We saw about 20 basis point increase. Little bit there is in the consumer loans, a denominator effect, again, related to the current regulation. Other than that, this is a very small fluctuation. Our cost of risk is stable. Cost of risk for the quarter was 1.4%. Again, in parallel of upgrading our NIM guidance, we are upgrade -- we have upgraded cost of risk guidance. Now we are seeing between 1.3% and 1.6%, but given the fact that main hit we are -- from the new regulation we are getting in this year, we expect the cost of risk to be quite close to the bottom end of the range.</p><p>The coverage ratio continues to be very strong. Coverage in cash is about 100%. Coverage in cash plus collateral is about 211%. Top 10 borrowers, they are at 9.6%, just very marginal increase year-on-year and decrease from the 31st December.</p><p>Operating expenses and overall the efficiency are given here. We are seeing 12.8% increase in cost for quarter 1 2019 versus quarter 1 2018. Again, year-on-year -- quarter-over-quarter, there is a huge decrease in cost, but this cost is also seasonal. Even though it is decreased, this would not imply much other than the fact that it is seasonal here too.</p><p>Cost to income, very good result. I would say there is a 40 basis point further decrease in cost to income if we speak about year-on-year performance. Again, cost to income decrease quarter-over-quarter is nice, but not relevant. It is seasonal.</p><p>Liquidity and capital base. In terms of liquidity ratios, we continue to operate on very high liquidity numbers. I mean in fact, the average liquidity numbers have been much higher than the numbers that are shown at the end of the reporting period. In fact, about 10 basis point from the decreasing NIM is related to higher than usual liquidity. Our liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter end was at 117%. Our net funding -- net stable funding ratio was 124%. We did check it couple of times, this is not mistake. It happens to be 124% across all the reporting period.</p><p>Capital, we have good buffer or comfortable buffer on top of the minimum capital requirement. Our minimum requirement for Tier 1 is 11.9%, we were at 13.8%. Most of you remember that there is a minimum capital adequacy ratio increasing requirement per NBG that increases year-on-year, but given the fact that we do accrue capital each year and we have good buffer, we will meet this requirement through internal sources. We might explore diversification going forward though.</p><p>Most of you might have heard that we did mandate UBS, J.P. Morgan and Renaissance Capital along with TBC Capital for potential bond issuance, potential euro bond issuance. They will be -- they are arranging the meetings with respective investors. If -- and then the size -- it will be U.S. denominated bond, REG S and 144 A, the size will be index inclusive and subject to market condition and the pricing, we might issue bonds. So that's one more initiative that we can share.</p><p>To summarize, our profitability drivers continue to be solid net interest margin, increasing net fee and commission income, prudent risk management and again improving cost efficiency, with the strong balance sheet of sustainable loan book growth as 10%, 15%, sound asset quality, strong liquidity and capital buffers. So I will be happy to answer your questions after the session is over.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: I'd like to invite our Chief Economist, Otar Nadaraia. Otar, over to you.</p><p>OTAR NADARAIA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Thank you. Thank you, Zoltan. So macro overview. I will briefly discuss Georgian economy and the exchange rate and also the credit growth predominantly from sustainability perspective. So as you probably know that 2018 was probably the year of proving the resilience because despite unfavorable developments in the region, also really tied fiscal policy domestically, the 4.7% growth in 2018 was really an achievement. Maybe a good question is, what would happen with exchange rate if the deficit -- if there was not really surplus fiscal, but deficit? But again the answer is that also NBG is buying reserves and was buying reserves also in 2018, and I will come back to reserves, but of course that means that inflows were sufficient even for higher growth.</p><p>As Deputy Chairman mentioned, our credit rating continues to improve. Also it may be argued that while looking at Georgian eurobonds and comparing with risk-free yields, so probably risk perception I would argue is improving even more as compared to what is it reflected in the credit rating.</p><p>I think very valuable information for all of us that in the very short-term -- if we think of U.S. dollar GEL and U.S. dollar euro, in very short-term GEL, in very short term when it's 1 day, 1 week or 1 month, GEL is more stable with dollar rather than euro. But if you go for 1 year, 2 years and medium to long-term, GEL is more stable with euro rather than dollar for many reasons, including higher inflows from EU, et cetera, et cetera. Those are described -- discussed in more details in our recently published TBC economic review, if you had a chance to look at it. Furthermore, what is also important, it's not only about exchange rate, but if you think of growth, the growth also is stable in euro rather than dollar. Of course, growth is mostly stable in GEL in Georgia, but then it's more stable in euro. The second chart shows euro dollar exchange rate and the GDP growth in Georgia. And you see that whenever euro is stronger, also growth is stronger in Georgia.</p><p>So briefly about our exposure to oil prices. As you probably know, it may be argued that Georgia's exposure is reasonably balanced from direct exposure, of course, we are petroleum importers, but we also receive inflows in form of exports, remittances, FDIs and tourism inflows from oil exporting countries. And of course, in case of inflows, the impact is not that proportional in case of lower oil prices as compared with oil imports, where you should expect more proportional impact on imports. At the moment, however, we believe that probably Georgia is benefiting probably more with relatively lower oil prices, why because unlike 2014, '15, '16, at the moment it appears that our oil exporting economic partners are better preferred -- prepared for oil's ups and downs because they have significant buffers in their budgets, so that they don't spend all when oil price is high.</p><p>Okay. So current account deficit. As Deputy Chairman mentioned, often current account deficit may reflect strengths and opportunity rather than weakness. Of course, it's always dangerous when you have higher consumption, higher inflation over the trend GDP growth, very high and unsustainable credit growth and you have wider and wider current account deficit, and in this case you might expect the ending of cycle in very dangerous way, and certainly this is not the case for Georgia. Even when you exclude the impact of South Caucasus Pipeline project, which had very large import component, even excluding that, current account deficit is improving. Also current account deficit adjusted -- as you can see from the right chart, adjusted for reinvested earnings, stood at 6%, so if you exclude also in 2018 imports related to South Caucasus Pipeline project. So projects are underlying -- what you might call underlying current account deficit is somewhere below -- even below 6%.</p><p>So next chart on external debt. It may be argued that Georgia's external debt has reasonably low-risk profile. Of course, if country is attractive, it's not about FDI only, but it's also debt financing. By the way, often debt is linked to LTIs when it's intercompany debt, especially in countries where you don't have so-called same capitalization rule, it's a taxation rule. Many companies prefer to lend to their subsidiaries rather than invest in equity. And as you can see, the FDI-related debt is quite high. Also the next chart is breakdown of long-term debt of nonfinancial corporates, and most of it -- or 45% is again intercompany debt, also around 30% is, what you can call, trade credit. So you can judge that overall it's -- the risk profile is reasonably low.</p><p>So reserves -- international reserves. As I said, NBG is building reserves. And by the way, NBG is building reserves in a countercyclical way. So as you can see from first chart, the green one is change in inflows as percent of GDP. The blue one is GDP growth and -- the light blue one, and the dark blue one is changing reserves as percent of GDP, so net buying. And as you can see whenever inflows growth is not that strong, NBG sometimes sells reserves or sometimes is not buying reserves, but whenever inflows are strong, NBG continues to build up reserves. At the moment, if you think of so-called ARA metric, so the adequacy of the reserves is something like close to 100%. If you think of short-term targets, so according to our estimates, NBG central bank already exceeds the short-term target by around USD 200 million, which is quite comfortable buffer. And by the way, NBG made a statement that in the short-term, they bought much more reserves and it is necessary and this also provides additional room for exchange rate to appreciate. We're going to discuss exchange rate also later.</p><p>So very briefly on fiscal. As you know, fiscal is very prudent in Georgia. In general, the fiscal burden is low, but furthermore the current spending is low. So current spending to GDP is only 23.2%. And according to the budget, the current spending share will be reasonably stable or even declining a bit, while capital spending is up. Also on cost of debt, so most of Georgia's debt is concessional from donor financing and is long-term, and weighted average cost of debt is only 2%. I think on new debt, they borrowed from one of the IFIs. I think they are paying 0.8%, even that. And overall debt level, the next chart provides information on FX adjusted debt to GDP and actual one. And as you can see, the FX adjusted so to exclude the depreciation effect, the debt to GDP level is even declining a bit.</p><p>So growth projections, I think it's really consensus that close or maybe above 5% growth rate for Georgia is so-called trend growth rate. As for 2019, probably it will depend on credit growth. So if credit growth is something like maybe 12%, we projected 4.7% for 2019; and if credit growth is close to 15%, so growth would be close to 5.4%. So if you think of first 4 months, I have to say that the growth is a bit higher than we were projecting around 2 months ago.</p><p>Some more details on our projections, so -- and you can see also this in TBC economic review in one of the insights. So if you project inflows, if you project credit growth and if you project fiscal, so you have quite good estimates for overall GDP growth, historical and also going forward.</p><p>So real effective exchange rate. So this is daily estimates of real effective exchange rate. The deviation from the period average, so if you update this up to today, still it looks more undervalued rather than overvalued exchange rate. And by the way, this exchange rate has very strong and pretty stable relationship with inflation. It's very difficult to say exact number, but on average 3% change in effective exchange rate, may lead to around 1% higher inflation in very short term. And also NBG is paying more attention to exchange rate. You can see also historically, that's the red cycle -- red cycles are tightening of policy rates -- those often coincide with weaker exchange rate and vice versa. Going forward, also we believe that together with being bullish on GEL, we believe that exchange rate is likely to be less volatile, again for 2 reasons, first is that probably seasonal pattern is -- will be less because of market perception. Some of the market participants are -- have started to buy GEL in winter times and sell in summer times. And also I think more important, I think NBG is willing to smooth some, what one would call -- what one may call, some unnecessary volatility.</p><p>So why real effective exchange rate and why not nominal effective exchange rate? As you know, maybe also in many textbooks, when we look at very short-term, people always look at nominal effective exchange rate rather than real effective exchange rate because real effective is probably more long-term, it has more long-term dynamics. But kindly note that in some of Georgia's economic partners, inflation is quite volatile often, like Turkey, this is example of Turkey. So Turkish lira has weakened a lot in nominal terms, but not really in real terms because inflation, both CPI and also PPI inflation has been very high in Turkey. So what we would suggest and what we would really argue even in short-term, it makes sense to look at real effective exchange rate rather than nominal effective using various techniques, whether you want to look -- whether it is above or below medium-term average, et cetera, et cetera, okay?</p><p>So now on long-term. So thanks to high GDP growth and also high productivity growth, our real effective exchange rate has long-term appreciating trend. And coupled with lower and lower inflation target, we believe that in medium- to long-term, it will be more reflected in nominal appreciation rather than appreciation via prices. So in other words, if real appreciation trend will continue, and probably that's the case, historical if inflation target was 6%, then it became 5%, then 4% and then 3%, meaning that there is more room for nominal appreciation. So to compare, to think of euro and dollar, of course, this is not exact thing, you can't say exactly, but if you have, let's say, productivity growth differential with [euro] area of 2% per year and your inflation differential is 1%, so 2% there and 1% in Georgia, your average long-term appreciation, nominal appreciation would be something like 1% per year.</p><p>I mentioned productivity, of course, productivity is very difficult to measure. But historically productivity was very high in Georgia. So quality of growth was high and is high, so it's not about overall growth only, but the quality is high, measured as contribution of productivity. Going forward, we believe that for many reasons, productivity should be -- maybe not as high as it used to be historically, but should stay high for many reasons, again, one reason is that in Georgia, you have private sector-led growth rather than government sector-led growth with many -- unfortunately, in many cases losing efficiencies, et cetera. Also if you look at employment, I think, one of the problems in Georgia is very high share of self employees. But I think at the same time, it's an opportunity because the share of hired employees is increasing as you can see from the second chart and also more jobs are getting -- are created not by government, but rather by the private sector.</p><p>In our projection, what we call a bit more than random walk, the exchange rate projection is very difficult to project, especially in the very short-term. But assuming reasonable stability of exchange rates and economic partners against dollar, and first of all, euro, also assuming inflation close to 3%, I mean this year should be somewhat higher, maybe 4.5% -- maybe 4%, 4.5%, including one-offs because if you exclude excise tax on tobacco, so inflation is pretty close to central bank's target. Also probably reasonable stability of commodity prices, some of them go up, some of them go down, so we project something like 2.67 as a period average for 2019 and also it appears to be the same for the end of 2019. So if euro strengthens, I would say my personal view, based on many assumptions, when euro strengthens, again based on medium-term logic, difficult to say exactly, but normally -- let's say, if euro strengthens against dollar by 10%, so you should expect GEL to strengthen against dollar maybe by 7%, maybe 8%, but I would say maybe 7%.</p><p>So if -- so in this projection in 2020, besides GEL having the appreciation in trend, in 2020 also you have assumption on stronger euro and consequently, much stronger GEL against dollar. So now on credit growth. So when people talk about credit growth sustainability, of course, there are many measures. But one used by Basel committee, also Central Banks, also IMF, is so called credit-to-GDP gap, so credit to GDP deviation from this trend. If you look at Georgia, so first one is credit-to-GDP gap at current exchange rate and second one is at constant exchange rate, so excluding exchange rate depreciation effect. This includes, by the way, bank credit, also microfinance organizations and also domestically issued corporate bonds.</p><p>So in Georgia's case like in many other emerging market cases was partially dollarized economy and banking systems and also with high level of inflows as the Deputy Chairman mentioned, because when you have 70% of GDP as inflow, so your target should not be at -- is not 100% local currency portfolio, yes? So you should have something like maybe in Georgian case something like 30%, what you can call natural level of dollarization. So it's now new fancy term introduced by IMF. So in our context, it's always better to look at credit-to-GDP gap at constant exchange rate, rather than current one. And I'll try very briefly to explain why. So first, when deviation from trend is, let's say, dangerous and leads to unsustainable growth, this credit growth often, if not always, maybe even always, it often coincides with asset price bubbles, yes? The high growth in consumption in small and open economies, growth in current account deficit and of course, again, above trend growth in GDP, and of course, all this can happen on the constant exchange rate under what you can call the real growth of credit. So real here means not inflation adjusted but just exchange rate adjusted and cannot happen under current exchange rate. Furthermore, from sustainability perspective, especially in the small and open economies, so you have unsustainable GDP and credit growth often with very high levels of inflows and often, exchange rate depreciates. And in that case, basically, credit-to-GDP gap at current exchange rate may even mask the unsustainable credit growth because if exchange rate appreciates at current one, you have lower growth as compared to what it is in reality.</p><p>So again to sum up, based on this very popular indicator, as the gap at constant exchange rate is certainly more important and more informative, and as you can see, in Georgia's case, the gap is close to 0. If you're following our publications, if you're subscribed to our website, the new one for Q1 at constant exchange turned even a bit negative, a bit negative, as a gap. It's not included here, just was published a few days ago. Also whenever you have unsustainable credit growth, one of the indicator is asset price bubbles. And asset price bubbles in Georgian constant is probably fair to say the housing, housing bubble. And it's good question whether we have bubble or not. And frankly, there are even no signs of bubble. If you look at quite standard assessment tools like real growth of house price in local currency inflation adjusted, so it's quite stable and flat. If you look at -- if you look like -- if you look at measures like price-to-rent ratio, so as you know, during bubbles, the price-to-rent ratio tend to increase because you have higher growth in prices rather than yields. Also many compare the housing yield with conventional savings, probably conventional and most popular comparable saving in Georgia probably is U.S. dollar deposit rate, which is around -- which is much lower at the moment as compared to housing yield, so housing yield is something like 8% to 8.5%. Also might be useful to look at GDP per capita and also house price across Central and Eastern European countries. And as you can see, we are somewhere below trend. So in long term, the housing price, sustainable housing price increases something like 2%, 3% in real term. Plus inflation in GEL, it should be like 5%, 6% and in long term, it's pretty same in dollars and euros.</p><p>So again, no signs of housing bubble. As you know, when you look at -- when you Google like unsustainable credit growth or banking distress, so it often -- you often see housing, which is rather than banking, which because house price bubble is very important indicator. So similar trend is for household debt. This is again at current exchange rate and at constant exchange rate. Unfortunately, we were unable to exclude loans to individual entrepreneurs from here because we don't have sufficient long-term data. But in terms of trend, this is still informative maybe not in terms of level because in terms of level, the household debt is much lower in Georgia. So when you exclude loans to individual entrepreneurs and also when you exclude credit to nonresidents, at the moment, there are -- I think that more than 10% of mortgage debt is debt to nonresident. So household debt to household income is quite stable in 2018. So you already have the impact of regulations. By the way, for simplicity, many compare household debt to GDP or credit to GDP across countries, but of course, from analytical perspective, it's better to compare household debt with household income. In Georgia's case, the share of household disposable income -- as a share of GDP, the household disposable income is higher as compared to the other countries. And there are several reasons like lower taxation and also remittances, remittances which are part of household income but not the GDP. On the next chart, you can see the household debt service to household income so what households pay on principal and interest during 1 year on a debt service. And there, you can see historically, despite high increase -- and by the way, that chart includes exchange rate effect also and that one also includes nonresidents and also individual entrepreneurs. Because unfortunately, we don't have so far system-wide data to look at system-wide all those indicators -- at this indicator. So if you exclude the individual entrepreneurs and also if you exclude nonresidents or further if you adjust for FX effects, so the debt service ratio is maybe even declining. Of course here, you should not exclude the FX effect because in case of debt service, certainly the current exchange rate certainly matters.</p><p>Okay. Just to compare with some countries -- by the way, I find it very difficult to compare penetration because not often, penetration is strongly linked to this GDP per capita level. And you can see household debt to household income like in Singapore is 2.5, so 250%. In Denmark and Northern Europe, it's very high. And by the way, European Systemic Risk Board -- they are talking about some vulnerabilities in northern Europe, chattering always about combination of high credit growth and the housing bubble and asset price bubbles.</p><p>One interesting comparison should be with Czech Republic. So again, household debt to household income, if you look at mortgage debt, still Georgia has much lower debt. Nonmortgage debt is a bit higher, excluding -- even excluding loans to individual entrepreneurs. However again, difficult to judge because normally in relatively lower-income countries and lower-income groups within countries, you have more nonmortgage debt rather than mortgage debt. Also unlike Georgia, like also in my view, penetration is difficult to compare. But unlike Georgia, you have -- in many countries, you have quite large share of unregulated markets like real estate developers issuing their own, call it, quality internal installments, which is basically -- which is not -- what is not reflected in bank lending, et cetera, et cetera. So all those should be -- yes, all those should be taken into account. So again, on business, business lending also when looking at penetrations, we have to look at bond market, again, FDI-related debt, intercompany lending, et cetera. And the last slide, as you probably know, the loan quality in very small loan segment has been an issue in Georgia. So some even were referring to overindebtedness. However, I'll note that in bank sector, in banking sectors, the quality of loan portfolio was stable. So this is quality of loan portfolio measured as number of loans. So even when you look at number of loans, the quality of loans in banking sector in retail was stable. And you can see this jump as a -- as a green -- sorry, as a green line, which was predominantly almost fully closed by sub-prime lending in nonbank sector and, of course, recently introduced 50% cap of effective interest rate already addresses this problem because this type of lending is not more -- not anymore sustainable. And I'll also note that most of those problem loans were very small loans like around half of them were less than $200 equivalent.</p><p>So I guess, this was the last slide.

No disclaimer. Okay. So with that, thank you very much.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Otar. Thank you very much there. I'm sure there will be many questions at the end on the macro. So the next presenter is David Chkonia who will talk about risk management.</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA, DEPUTY CEO, CHIEF RISK OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, JSC TBC BANK: Hello, everyone, and welcome to risk management. Thank you for sticking around those of you that stayed, and I'll try to make it quick, hit the highlights and then I'll be looking forward to your questions after this session. So I would like to talk -- first, I would like to talk about our risk management framework and approach like we've done before. And I think this is important because if you get this right and you have this right, then you can sort of build and expand into different directions then you can build on it. And as you can see, we're building a lot currently. And in the second part, I'll talk about the portfolio structure, hit the highlights of the performance again and look at some benchmarking also.</p><p>So just to recap, we focused a lot on our -- on the philosophy of risk management in TBC, which is to have a strong independent control function but at the same time have a business-minded and oriented function that works with business units with various counterparts across the organization to find solutions to problems or cases, whether it's structuring transactions or designing new processes and products. And then the agile organization contacts, which is where we have transitioned, as you have heard, we are significantly increasing the engagement of risk with the agile teams.</p><p>Our framework for risk management has most of the components -- all of the components that we think we need to identify and manage risk across the organization. I like to highlight the risk culture here as something that is entrenched throughout the organization and that really shapes how employees of the group make risk-based decisions. Management and managers obviously have a key role in promoting and communicating risk culture throughout the organization. And we have a reward system that incentivizes people to take risk decisions in line with the risk appetite of the bank.</p><p>Risk is part of the governance structure at all levels of the group. So the Board is involved in risk management on a regular and a quarterly basis as well as on ad hoc basis for various topics. It signs off on large exposure as in the corporate clients, on related party transactions. It approves risk appetite and various other sort of principle risk management methodologies and approaches. At the management Board level, we talk about risk more often on a regular basis. The key here is to ensure that risk objectives and expectations are integrated into bank -- aligned with bank strategy and integrated into overall business planning of the group. And there is a centralized risk management function that reports to the CRO and creates sort of a clearly defined path of accountability and communication for risk. One of the principal sort of governance tools that we have is our risk appetite. Some of you are familiar with this. We sort of assign our targets to various key parameters that we measure and monitor at the bank. There's some high-level parameters and then this cascades down to sort of segment and product level as well. And this is reviewed on a regular basis at the Board level, at the management Board level. Here, you can see an example of our NPL ratio being comfortably within our target zone. There are a number of things that we did -- development that we did in risk in the past year. We -- 2018 was the first full year of IFRS 9 reporting, as you know, and the provision level sort of came out as expected, together with our external auditors who worked on it. We did validation and backtesting of our models, and all came out within the target sort of thresholds that we had. I would just add, importantly, that we set up over the last couple of years big infrastructure or IT data models to cover for this. And it has proven to be stable and fairly robust over this last year, and that was very important from the operational perspective.</p><p>Something that we spent most of our time on in the last 12 months is implementing the new methodologies and technically implementing the regulations, the new lending regulations. And what I mean is -- and not just obvious is to be in compliance with regulation but then designing, redesigning the credit process so that we are efficient in how we sort of comply with certain requirements. In particular, income verification requirements and we'll talk a little bit more about this, and this took a lot of direct work with the regulator as well. Last year, we set out on an ambitious capital optimization program and have saved a significant amount of RWA, which you can see sort of our RWA-to-loans density ratio has come down several percentage points, and it has impacted capital adequacy by about close to 100 basis points, which is particularly helpful and impactful in the new capital -- regulatory capital framework where we see capital requirement increase every year over a 5-year period.</p><p>We invested quite a bit in the retail sort of collection infrastructure and environment last year. We invested in more sophisticated and smart communication and telephony systems and that has enabled us to increase efficiency of our operators by 40%. And then that sort of directly drove recoveries because we had capacity to have broader reach to -- with our borrowers and our customers at sort of segmented more granularly, which we also do based on statistical analysis, et cetera. And over the coming period, our focus is going to be to sort of significantly redefine the credit cycle in some of our key products. So as you know, in the consumer products, we have a highly automated process. The majority -- a big majority of our consumer products are approved and instantaneously decision is provided to customers -- to borrowers on their applications. This has now slightly changed because of the regulation and operational component of income verification has been added. But we're trying to sort of maintain that process there. But we're working on creating an instantaneous sort of decision in principal process, what we call straight-through processing for the majority of mortgage applications that we receive. And in fact, last week was when we started to launch this process already in their mortgages in customers that receive instant decisions, subject to certain operational checks again to be aligned with the regulation. But they should significantly -- that's something relatively new on the Georgian market and should increase -- have a good impact with our customers. And at the end of the year or closer to the end of the year, we are trying to do the same with small ticket business loans in SME as well -- in MSME as well.</p><p>I want to mention a few things about regulation obviously which after a lot of discussion and debate came January 1 of this year. It covers loans to individuals and to summarize key aspects of it are PTI and LTV caps, which are a lot more conservative for foreign currency loans, shorter -- fixed terms are defined for secured and unsecured loans. And there is a requirement to do income verification of borrowers. Obviously, this is pretty straightforward in cases where there is official income. But for all other cases, for self-employed population and we've just heard that there is a big portion of it in Georgia, it is more challenging. And then also to worth mentioning here that in September of last year, there was new law that required that all loans under GEL 200,000 equivalent be issued in lari. So that threshold has increased to promote larization. I think what's really important here also is that this regulation now covers all lenders in the country, including nonbanks and the microfinance organizations so that -- which is really good because the discrepancy that Otar just showed us in terms of performance, that's what the regulator wanted to address. Now in terms of impact, on the next few slides in terms of portfolio structure and performance, we'll come back to this and talk about the impact. But in terms of disbursements, initially, there was quite significant impact obviously in the banking sector and in January before banks started to adjust to the new reality and figure out ways and work with the regulator, come up with solutions on how to continue disbursing where disbursement was good to do and the regulator also agreed with it. But having said that, there is obviously a population of borrower segments and product types that have become unbankable under this -- under the new regulation.</p><p>So one principal change is that -- is related to portfolio structure. Giorgi mentioned earlier that the share of the consumer products has decreased now in our portfolio, in our retail portfolio and the share of mortgages has increased. Consumer products are higher NIM, higher cost of risk products and they are decreased in the weight of the portfolio means that overall NIM has adjusted downwards and cost of risk has also decreased by about 30 basis points, we estimate. We'll talk about this portfolio structure impact across other slides as well. But this is our overall portfolio structure. You will see that the retail portfolio is now 44% of our total portfolio. And this is impact of regulation in 2018 when some preliminary regulation started as well has come down. There is a small one-off resegmentation effect, but we are at 44% now. And we're expecting that this level will stay this year and going forward. And then obviously, our corporate business is now about a third of the portfolio in MSME. This is broadly in line with our business strategy and objective. And we think this is a pretty well-diversified portfolio. Looking at industry sectors, you will see that energy and utilities is still the biggest sector in our portfolio at 8% of it. But as I've noted before, the segment is made up of sort of 3 distinct subsectors from risk perspective. So there is utilities, which is a regulated business. You have retail, petroleum products, trading and then you have renewable hydropower plants, which is a big important sector in Georgia and TBC is one of the leaders in this sector. Hospitality and leisure has become a bigger -- taken bigger share in the portfolio. And again, this is in line with the growth and importance that the sector has taken in the Georgian economy especially in the last 12 to 18 months. On the retail side, you will see that mortgages is now more than half. It's actually about 60% of the portfolio -- of the retail portfolio and has increased since 1 year ago.</p><p>So portfolio concentration is -- we look at the right-hand chart here. The top 10 borrowers at about 10%, which is where our sort of target is and our comfort level lies. It has increased in 2018 because of some successful new corporate client acquisitions that we did during the year. As a result of that and from that, we've looked at being more active in syndicating some of these loans and have had success especially in Q1. Some of our big corporate clients also did successful capital markets transactions both on local markets and on international markets, and we have used some of these proceeds to repay local bank exposure but very good validation of the strength of the corporate client base that TBC has.</p><p>The next one is on -- yes, so this is on collateralization. And you know that we have strongly collateralized portfolio. 72% now is secured with cash, gold, real estate. And it's really -- we leverage this in recovery work that we do with certain clients obviously. Our unsecured portfolio is 11%. 1 year ago, this was 17%. So this has come down. And again, it's resulting from the change in the portfolio structure and the consumer products, reducing the share of the portfolio.</p><p>Yes. So this is obviously something that we look at closely, the foreign currency share of the portfolio total is 60%. It hasn't really come down in Q1 and/or 2018. And regulations in the portfolio structure had -- has had impact on this as well. Because if we look at it segment by segment, we'll see that corporate has decreased, business borrowers have decreased. But in retail, it has actually increased, and it's increased because mortgages now represent a bigger share of the total portfolio, and mortgages at this point is a more dollarized portfolio than consumer.</p><p>Now having said that, we look at disbursements in quarter 1 in mortgages, and a significantly bigger portion of mortgages is now being disbursed in Georgian lari than what it was 1 year ago. So about 50% now versus 20% 1 year ago. So over time, we expect to see that mortgage portfolio will start to sort of dedollarize, so to say, and that will sort of drive overall dedollarization in the portfolio.</p><p>So very quickly on this because we mentioned earlier, we had stable performance. Again, 2018 in terms of NPL were 3.1%, which is historically lowest in recent years and 3.3% in Q1, cost of risk at 1.4% on an FX-adjusted basis, lower than 1.7% in the quarter in the prior period. The portfolio structure, Giorgi talked about this. We talked about it that new regulations had impact on this, had positive impact on it from the portfolio structure perspective. And it even offset some of the sort of negative impact that we saw from certain borrower segments becoming more risky because they lost access to finance because of new regulations so -- but the overall portfolio effects sort of had a bigger impact on this. Now this was what we started to see immediately. This is sort of short-term impact in Q1 more in the medium term because the regulations, overall, they set out a more conservative lending parameters and lending framework to individuals. We think that in the medium-term, overall riskiness of the retail portfolio will decrease with these regulations.</p><p>And finally, I'll talk about TBC versus market. This is always interesting to look at. On the left-hand side, you will see portion of the portfolio that's 90 days overdue. And for TBC, it's 1.2% as of Q1. And for the market excluding TBC, it's 4.2%. So that's about a 3 to 4x difference in terms of the ratio. And on the right-hand side, you can look at NBG NPLs. NBG has a standardized NPL definition, and so you can compare different bank's figures without having to understand their individual NPL methodology, so this is fairly consistent and apples-to-apples comparison. And you can see that the gap -- the difference in Q1 was about 50% between TBC and the market. We look at -- you can dive into these figures at segment level as well. And we look at that, we see that each segment has a positive gap in TBC versus the market. But in particular, the biggest gap comes from the corporate segment. So the overall quality of the corporate portfolio is significantly better from this metric than market, excluding TBC. So this is the last slide, and I'll be around to take your questions. Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: All right. The next few presentations, we will discuss our 3 main banking divisions. We'll start with retail. So I'll ask Nino Masurashvili, Head of Retail Banking to come to stage. Corporate...</p><p>NINO MASURASHVILI, DEPUTY CEO OF RETAIL BANKING &amp; MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, JSC TBC BANK: Corporate?</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Is it? Corporate.</p><p>NINO MASURASHVILI: (foreign language)</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: So a lot of change in plans. We start with Corporate, George Tkhelidze?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible) Good joke, right?</p><p>NINO MASURASHVILI: To make a little bit fun. Okay. So thank you, Zoltan. So if you can still listen, I will be talking about the retail segment. You know that we're #1 in the market, serving 2.3 million customers covering almost all bankable population in Georgia. We're very proud with our 42% digital penetration amongst our active customers. TBC retail segment contributes to the total retail -- total portfolio in loans by 44%, while in deposit by 54%. The transactions are heavily offloading. We already talked about that. And now the ratio by the end of the first quarter is 92%.</p><p>We are market leaders with around 39% both in loans and deposits followed by the Bank of Georgia and then with the large cap by the other players.</p><p>Retail loans have increased by 15% compared to the last year's same period, while deposits have increased by 17%. This year, we have a shrinkage of portfolios mainly because of regulation and also seasonality effect. Share of the mortgage loans, as David already mentioned, has increased this year because according to the new regulation, most of the consumer loans are regulated. In deposit, we have -- for term deposits, they have 54%, while the others are savings account -- there was no major changes here.</p><p>Now how are we differentiated? So we're focusing on 3 main pillars, which is best customer experience, you know about it; our multichannel with strong focus on digital; and advanced analytical capabilities.</p><p>Now let's start with our customer experience. So according to our annual survey, 50 out of 100 people say that TBC is the best service company in Georgia. And now how we are bringing those results? The most -- biggest contributor is our multichannel. Since 92% of all transactions are performed digitally, our customers enjoy great user experience. Our application has 4.9 star rating on Google Play, which is amongst the best in the world and globally. Another one is problem-solving, which is very important for our customers, and here you can see that 97% of all complaints are resolved within 1 day, 24 hours. Our branches for those customers, who are still coming to our modern branches, we also developed superior customer experience and 88% of all customers wait in line in less than 5 minutes. And finally -- this is a very important one. According to our engagement survey, which is annual, 90% of all employees say that they think that TBC is a very customer-centric organization.</p><p>As Vakhtang already mentioned, this year, we have started our agile transformation program. And the main strategy here is to become more dynamic, flexible and customer-centric organization. We have differentiated 2 distinctive segments, which is mass retail customers and affluent customers. Here, you see the criteria. According to which, we serve 2.3 million mass customers and 45,000 affluent customers. The product holding is very different. In mass, we have 3.6. While in affluent, we have twice as much, 8.5. And we have created 2 different leagues, which is tribes -- we call it leagues, which is mass customers and affluent ones. The share of these 2 segments in a loan portfolio is roughly the same, 50 to 50, while in deposits, affluent customers have 64% share, while the retail has 36%. And now these 2 distinctive tribes are focusing on achieving the targets.</p><p>Now let's start with the mass retail tribe. Here, the important -- what happened here is that we very much changed our structure from the product-centric structure -- we had previously product-centric department to the customer-centric. And according to that, we're differentiated under the mass retail, 3 main sub-segments, which is youth and young professionals; family and elders; and Georgian diaspora. And on the following slide, I would talk about the mission and targets of each of them.</p><p>Now let's start with the young and young professional squad. This segment and this subsegment is very important for us because we need to make sure that our company has sustainable, growing customer base. And the aspiration for us here is to become a love mark for this segment. Now here, on one hand, we focus on the partnership with major universities and schools and also on educational workshops in [Frankfurt,] and on the other hand on lifestyle. And we're sponsoring different music festivals and events. And our dedicated squad are creating the special value proposition for this segment using the targeted products and offerings. The main communication channel with this segment is certainly digital. Especially, our chatbot, what we call T-Bot, is very popular among the youngsters. The number of clients is increasing rapidly. Now we're selling 0.5 million of -- in this subsegment, and now our aspiration here is to increase our market share from 20% to 50% in 3 years' period.</p><p>Now another squad, another subsegment, which is families and elderly. This is like a core of our mass retail segment since 78% of all customers fit in this subsegment. We are very strong in payroll market with 41% market share. And the number of clients here is also increasing, reaching already 1.8 million customers. Here, our main focus is to transform from customer single view to family view; and this squad here also preparing different and special value proposition to better serve the families' saving and service and buying needs.</p><p>And finally, third squad in our mass retail tribe. This is the Georgian diaspora. You know that population of Georgia is right now 3.7 million, but another 1.5 million lives abroad. And they are mainly located 80% in 5 different countries. And our aspiration is here to accommodate them with the banking services. And the main products here are payments and the fast transfer, certainly, then savings and mortgage solutions because the main reason these people are living abroad is to purchase a house at their home country.</p><p>Our another tribe is affluent tribe, which already I mentioned. So here, we have 3 different squads. This is the affluent banking, wealthy individuals, newly launched affluent digital banking, and lifestyle. Lifestyle squad serves all the 3 because the lifestyle offering is a very important part in the value proposition for the affluent customers.</p><p>How are we differentiated here? So in our sales strategy, we are saying that our universal banker serves our customers' banking and financial needs. And to effectively do so we're leveraging our data. And through our data, we are gathering personalized product and the lifestyle offering for our clients. Then we are very keen on providing superior customer experience. And here for this reason, we have established dedicated quality assurance group. And this group, on a monthly basis, through our monthly research, are checking the NPS of our customers. And if there is some deviation, they are initiating the changes in our service processes. And if there is some weaker service, then they are doing service recovery. And lifestyle. We have built this year -- from the last year very strong value proposition in our affluent. And here, our aspiration is to become a #1 lifestyle brand focusing on self-development, expertise, art, culture, events and good cause. I will talk about later in a few minutes.</p><p>Now a few figures. In the first quarter, we're serving 43,000 customers, and annual growth in the number of customers were up 40%. The NPS is very high, 73%. Our customers are very digital in affluent, and digital penetration is 82% compared with 40% in mass segment. Both in retail -- in mass -- in affluent loans and deposit, there is a strong growth in the loan portfolio and deposit portfolio. And the figures are 42% and 29%. And in the loans, it's especially the mortgage loans.</p><p>In our wealth management segment, here, it's important to say that last year, we have started to offering some investment products through our TBC Capital, and George will talk about that more later.</p><p>And I would like to talk a little bit more about our new initiative, which is absolutely a whole digital offering to our affluent customers. This project was launched 2 months ago and it was the second project of our data and analytical teams together with the business. We have identified 14,000 new customers, which we're targeting to onboard by the end of the year. In 2 months, we already onboarded up to 4,000 customers, which is 25% of our annual target. Very good result was in the conversion rate and it has increased from 7% to 25%, and it shows that value propositions that we already have created is very well fitting our customers' needs. So just to say, it is absolutely fully digital, end-to-end process without a banker, but the affluent customers can benefit with all benefits other affluent customers have. And in case they have some complaints and they need a human help, then in a call center, we have a special, dedicated team for serving those customers.</p><p>In lifestyle, we are doing really a lot of things, which is art, CSR, music support. This kind of activity is very relevant to our affluent customers, but I would like to emphasize a new initiative which we have started to do this year and this is the educational platform. We have started to do twice a week, 100 people workshop, gathering where the local and international speakers from different fields come and share their experience. It became very popular. Already 2,500 customers attended those events during this year. And we are receiving very positive feedback from our customers. We're targeting to continue this initiative by the end of the year. We target to cover around 15,000 such clients.</p><p>And finally, before I will end the -- my presentation on the customer experience, I would like to show you the results of our loyalty system, which we started some 2 years ago. Right away, we have 250 partners and there is a very big demand for new partners to join this platform. We already have done, this year, 500 campaigns for our 1.5 million cardholders. And here, it's very important to mention that 50% of all points that are executed on customers are paid by our partners. So this is the first data monetization project that we have done in TBC Bank. It is really huge in money amount. And here on this slide, you can see how our card -- credit card holders have changed the payment behaviors. The transaction in POS terminals on a credit card has increased by 20% from 54% to 70%. This is a really huge change.</p><p>Now a few words about our second pillar, digital. We are talking about that quite a lot. We have started our digital journey in 2012 and introducing new products and innovative products and offerings since that. We have also very heavily invested in digital education of our clients and employees as well. And as a result, digital penetration is rapidly growing. And here, it's important to show the mobile-only presentation and -- which is already 20%. It means that 20% of all customers never use other channel rather than mobile. Digital transaction is increasing also very rapidly. And if you look -- if we look on branch transactions there, we already have a decrease.</p><p>As already mentioned, 92% of all transactions are offloaded, which is absolutely good result because it gives us the freedom to focus in our branches on sales activity.</p><p>Digital sales are also increasing. Right away, we already have 45% and the main share is from the deposit openings. And here, we are focusing to adding new products and services for our customers to purchase into the Internet and mobile. For example, right now, we do not have a mortgage loan in Internet and mobile bank. So we are going to add in an Internet bank, first of all.</p><p>And finally, our third pillar, which is advanced analytical capabilities. We're absolutely sure that in order to maintain our -- further strength in our leading position, it is absolutely important to focus on the client. It is in our strategy. And leveraging data analytics is the fastest way to become really customer-centric organization.</p><p>We have very good precondition to quickly move in these directions, which are we have more than 1,000 variables on our 2.3 million customers, which include demographics, product holding, spending, channel usage and many, many more. We enjoy a very high trust amongst our customers. Our strong multichannel gives us 8 different communication channels with our customers. And finally but most important one, we have a very strong team who has 5-year experience in modeling.</p><p>Our aspiration is to become #1 data-driven company. And in order to do so we are building on 2 main elements, which is, first of all, in the whole organization, people should understand why they need data. And in order to achieve that, we started from this year extensive internal trainings to show the people how to use data, why they use -- should use it, and how it will help the business to achieve their targets and goals; and best talent on the market. So we are looking for them doing different activities to -- in order to attract them. And we have an aspiration to execute, in 3 years' period, 23 use cases, which will generate extra GEL 100 million profit per year.</p><p>Next. So the scope of the data -- the scope of this data analytics program that we're covering all part of the bank, which is the segments, retail, SME, corporate, risk part, insurance, operation, and later on, we will move on ecosystem. And we will be impacting the all part of profitability, which is revenues, cost optimization, churn, sales maximization, et cetera.</p><p>What we have done already? So the first use case, we have already completed last year. This is a consumer lending focusing on the price and the limit optimization. So it is already done. I will show the results later. Then 2 new use cases, which is affluent value proposition, digital value proposition, which I already talked; and MSME subscription-based services, which Niko will talk later. It is already in progress, up and running and already generated very good results. And next 2, which is next product to buy in retail, and also deposit pricing. It is in its MVP phase and it will shortly start to piloting.</p><p>Now the result of our first use case, which was the consumer lending. Here, you see that all main parameters have overachieved and it is very promising results. And after the piloting, when we scaled up, we have maintained 200% profit increase, which is absolutely good.</p><p>In order to maintain, which we have already achieved, we have started our school of analytics. Vakhtang already talked about it. And here, our aspiration is to first train, well-train our core people in headquarters. This is 500 people and also train everyone into branches because it is very important for them to understand why they should use whatever is coming from the headquarters.</p><p>We have designed a special material, especially for our analytical team. And in a 3-year period, we believe that it will be a very, very strong team, not only in Georgia but also in the region and probably beyond.</p><p>So just to finalize and repeat once again, so we are focusing on 3 -- 4 main pillars, which is superior customer experience, innovating product offerings, multichannel and analytical capabilities. Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Next, our Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, George, please. Hopefully, it works.</p><p>GEORGE TKHELIDZE, DEPUTY CEO OF CORPORATE &amp; INVESTMENT BANKING AND MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT BOARD, JSC TBC BANK: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I checked the clock, it's still afternoon, not evening yet, and I'm (inaudible). And I know it's becoming more and more challenging to present to you, but please stick with us. We have very good wine tasting just after 2 sessions. So -- and in plus, we have great results in corporate and investment banking. And this is once in a year opportunity to share with you our achievements, so I'll try to be brief. The presentation will be structured in like 3, 4 main areas. One -- in the first section, I'll just talk briefly about the corporate and investment banking at glance, who we are. And then I will move to corporate banking performance, shifting to investment banking, then summarize our presentation and talk a little bit about the going forward statements and aspirations that we have.</p><p>So who we are? We are the #1 corporate and investment bank in Georgia, and we are leading the positions across all corporate and investment banking products. So market share ranges from 37% to 55% across various product lines, and I'll talk about it during the presentation.</p><p>If you look at CIB from TBC Banking Group perspective, then we hold 33% of total group loan book, 36% of deposits and 94% of trade and guarantees portfolio.</p><p>As a team, we're 120 people out of 7,500, but this is a very strong team, and we're especially proud of the execution capabilities that the team has. And we are managing 2,700 relationships, corporate clients across 17 sectors of Georgian economy.</p><p>That's very briefly. Now I will move to corporate banking performance and start with credit portfolio. We had strong growth over the past 12 to 15 months. The growth was 29% in 2018 and 35% on a quarter-on-quarter basis in Q1. Especially, I would like to highlight the growth in mid-corporate and regional banking because this was the area for our focus, which we were presenting last year on the Capital Market Day. You see that the mid-corporate segment grew by 36% in 2018 and 36% -- sorry, 69% in 2019 Q1. Especially, we strengthened our positions in regions and in mid-corporate segment, which enables us to build more diversified portfolio. And you shared that starting from 2018, share of mid-corporate segment increased from 28% to 35%. We had strong growth in large corporate segment as well. This translated into further strengthening of our market position, and our market share stands at 37%.</p><p>If we move now on our portfolio -- sorry. Sorry. Okay. Yes. I'll move to the portfolio diversification across sectors. David already mentioned and talked about our positioning in the sectors. The corporate loan book is spread across 17 sectors. And importantly, we had double-digit growth almost in every sector of Georgian economy, and this translated into diversification and also increased positions and strengthened positions in each sector of Georgian economy.</p><p>Strong business growth also translated into stronger deposits gathering capabilities, and we see that we had 34% growth in deposits, both in 2018 and in Q1. And we also gained further market share on the market positioning, which increased from 38% to 41%. One important aspect also I would like to highlight is the structure of our deposit book. We focused more on the local currency gathering, and share of local funding increased from 50% to 58% in Q1 2018 -- '19, sorry.</p><p>I would like also to touch on the guarantees and documentary business. In 2016, when we were presenting this business, we highlighted that after the acquisition of Bank Republic, we strengthened position in the guarantees and documentary business. We doubled the portfolio that time to close to GEL 700 million, and we acquired also a very strong team in this product line. The good thing is that we also almost doubled our portfolio. After the acquisition of Bank Republic, the loan book grew from GEL 700 million to GEL 1.3 billion as of Q1. The market share has been strengthened. Now we hold 47% in this product line. And importantly, we have a very strong recognition from various partners like Global Finance, named as the Best Trade Finance Bank in Georgia; and our IFI partners, ADB and EBRD named as the most active and leading partners in Georgia in this product line.</p><p>Last slide in corporate banking sector, I would like to -- no, this is pre-last slide. I'll be very brief. Just strong business growth translated into strong interest and noninterest income generation. So we had a strong double-digit growth across all product lines in treasury, operation, trade finance income or net interest income lines.</p><p>And important component of CIB in TBC Bank's perspective is that we are active and strong cross-sell generation vehicle for the bank. Strong business growth is linked to the generation of 2 main product lines that are linked to the corporate clients. Payments business, you see that we have 118% and 115% compounded annual growth rate. This has been reflected both in number of transaction and also in the turnover. If we look at the payroll, we have compounded annual growth rate of 47% and 49% in payroll accounts and the payroll account fund. So this is, again, another strong growth and contribution to the group from the CIB.</p><p>I'll conclude corporate banking, and now I would like to move to investment banking overview. This is an important aspect of our business. We are developing investment banking through our wholly owned subsidiary, TBC Capital, third year in a row. We invested in the team, and I think we already have great results. I'll touch upon selected key product line. One is the syndications.</p><p>So in syndications, we executed 23 deals with 10 Georgian and regional banks. This amounts to GEL 357 million. This number is very important because I mentioned, corporate bank grew by GEL 700 million last year, right? This was 40% of the market. And originally, we originated more than GEL 1 billion of transactions. We just shared this amount with the Georgian market. So we contributed to the market by GEL 1 billion. This is one important thing, and there's a recognition by the clients that we are really large deal origination powerhouse. But 2 other important benefits that we bring with this syndication is additional income lines both for interest income and fee income and also management of the concentrations because we are working mostly with the large clients, and this is opportunity for us also to share this portfolio with the Georgian banks, with IFIs and with regional partners.</p><p>Next important product line which, again, we mentioned and highlighted last year is debt capital markets. Georgian debt capital markets has a really great period currently. Last year, DCM -- corporate DCM grew from GEL 284 million to GEL 824 million. This is 190% growth. And TBC Capital originated GEL 305 million on the market, which is 55% of total transactions.</p><p>On the next slide, we have highlighted 11 transactions that has been executed by TBC Capital team. These are spread across various industries: telecom, financial services, residential, real estate, food production, drinks production, distribution, you name it. So -- and we have also importantly very strong pipeline this year. I'm sure that next year, we will be presenting much more deals with -- and larger pipeline, both local currency and foreign currency DCM transactions.</p><p>And another important area and focus area for us in TBC Capital and investment banking is industry research. This is a great tool for us as a bank and for our corporate clients to gain deep insights about the sector, trends, get insights about the benchmarks, both locally and with the regional peers. And TBC Capital Group, which has been assembled year ago, already initiated 3 sector research. This was fixed income, fast-moving consumer goods and residential real estate. These research reports have been published and presented to the markets through the various industry events, and we are very proud that findings from this research reports are often highlighted by the industry specialists, media and state representatives during the various discussions. This year, we have target to cover minimum 50% of all key sectors of Georgian economy and initiate the additional 6 to 7 research reports and share it with the clients. And this is, again, free of charge for our customers and market.</p><p>This is basically about corporate and investment banking. Probably nobody will tell you after the presentation that we will stop somewhere. We are continuing to grow, and I think we are focusing on 3 pillars. One is the -- being the #1 partner bank for Georgian corporate. This is very important, especially considering our scale. And I think managing the relationship and executing the transactions and staying closer to the clients is extremely important because market is very competitive. We would like to continue being the leader in the capital market development aspects and to support the stock exchange development, both on a DCM and ECM side. And we are trying to be the market innovator, and I think we are doing it well. We just continue it through the various product offerings, focusing especially in second half of 2019 and 2020 on all lending products and solutions for our corporate clients. This is it. Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, George. So after talking about retail and corporate, now we talk about MSME Banking. So welcome back, Nik Kurdiani.</p><p>NIKOLOZ KURDIANI: I'm not sure about the mic. Mic #1. All right. So moving on to MSME, I will try to be brief because it's almost not anymore afternoon, as George said. So I'll try...</p><p>GEORGE TKHELIDZE: (inaudible)</p><p>NIKOLOZ KURDIANI: Yes, exactly. That's (inaudible). Yes. And George gave me 2 challenges, one is the afternoon topic and the second one is the super performance he and (inaudible) Nino also had. So I will show you what we did in MSME. Basically, we are also the #1 player on the market. We hold 44% of the market share. This figure is something we are very proud of and we are trying to tell you every year. 63% of all newly created businesses in Georgia would open a current account with TBC. Transaction offloading, as Nino also spent some time on it, we have 92%. So 92% of all transactions which the businesses would do with TBC are being done online or in remote channels. Transaction growth, so the activity of the customers is steadily growing 25% -- 21% over several years. And the net promoter score, so the happiness of customers, so banking with us, so to say, is 77%, which is quite high as well.</p><p>Now moving on. Yes, this is just quick slide on the market share in Georgia. It's very difficult to really estimate the market shares because it's not reported, being the national bank reporting separately. So what we do is we compare ourselves with key players on the MSME market, and this is the market share we hold, 44%.</p><p>In terms of the loan portfolio and deposit portfolio, we had a very significant growth. If you take year-on-year performance, for the first quarter, we almost grew 30%. Deposits grew 7%. It is less definitely than the loan portfolio, but there, we have the strategy of not paying interest on the accounts. So basically, the whole portfolio of deposits we have is just interest with current accounts, and it's growing with the same pace as the customer base is growing in their activity. So customer activation directly impacts the deposit base growth.</p><p>If we move on, on the NPS slide. As I said, NPS is a simple question where the customer is being asked would he or she recommend the TBC Bank and its operations in business banking to friends. And here, we have 2 basically parameters. We look always, it's borrowers and TBC only or BOG only, peer bank only, as we have on the slide, customers. And in both, we have a very positive gap, and the gap is improving. So it is very important as we said in various presentations throughout the day. Customer experience is the central pillar for the bank, for the bank's value proposition. And in all segments, we basically measure it. We even measure the customer experience, the NPS, internally within our employees because -- it's called ENPS because it directly translates how well we serve our customers. So this is just the summary of the gaps with our main competitor.</p><p>The next one is something which normally would not be part of this type of presentations, but I think it's very important, and we put lots of emphasis on it. It's the top of mind. So how well the brand is positioned basically, and the brand in this case is the business banking brand of TBC. And we call it TBC for Business. And the first part is where the customer would be asked, which is the bank which comes to your mind which serves in the best way in businesses. And it is basically -- these are the gaps. So 43% in 2018, 43% of all customers asked who would say TBC is the one. And the second one is something we work on so that the perception in customers' minds is built this way. It is the best business supporting bank, and there also 27% of all businesses mentioned that it is TBC Bank. So we are leading the position there as well on the market.</p><p>Moving on. Yes, this is a slide which I bring every year to this day. It shows that in 2018, in Georgia, we had 253,000 registered businesses. And the share of the businesses which bank with us is 43%, and we increase it every year. So just to imagine that in the country, there are 253,000 businesses operating, and out of which 43% are our customers. And this figure is also massive.</p><p>The next slide is of the same structure. However, it represents the 63% I mentioned on the first slide. And you see the position. So there were 25,000 new businesses in 2018, out of which 63% started banking with us.</p><p>Yes. This is the customer growth figure and then with respect to their activity. So we have -- at the moment, we have 130,000 business customers. And the next chart basically shows the transactional activity of these customers, and this is steadily growing with 25% -- 21% and it reached 9.5 million in last year, which shows that, I mean we spend lots of our time and energy on activating the customer base because this directly translates into the deposit base, as I mentioned, or into the fee and commission income because the transactions are generating the fees.</p><p>Sorry. No. Too much multimedia. Yes. Offloading. Basically, this is just to show the trend of offloading. In offloading, what we do basically is -- it's not that we don't want the customers to interact with the bank, or if they interact with the bank, they would do it only online. We just want to make the experience better. So we find the ways how to save their time, make the process hassle-less or seamless and at the same time, interact with them quite a lot. So the interaction is measured by the number of transactions, as I showed you on the previous slide. And these transactions mostly are done in remote channels. So 92% are done in remote channels, and only 8% are remaining within the bank, within the branch. And these are mostly those ones which need a paper. But here, we are also working and I'll show you on the next slide some things which we do so that they don't come to the bank just for the sake of the paper signage. And then this 92% will increase further. So we hope that this trend will be continued, and we'll reach the target 95% in the next years.</p><p>This is just a quick summary of digitalization exercise. The 83% is the figure of all customers who are from the whole base who are using the Internet banking, and 33% is the mobile-only basically customers. And 17% is something I mentioned on the previous slide is the number of digitally onboarded customers. So 17% of all customers which we got into the bank as customers basically onboarded without even touching the branch. So they did not sign anything. They didn't come to the bank. They basically did it fully digitally, and this is done very quickly. I will show you on the next slide the measurement of it in minutes, and 92% is the same figure as the offloading figure. So we are massively investing our time into fully digital onboarding, into Internet and mobile banking solutions for businesses and dedicated call center processes for customers, which they can do in remote way.</p><p>This is previously and now. Basically, previously, the customer would come to the branch, would spend something like 40 minutes on opening the account, doing the onboarding procedure. Average -- on average, one product would -- the basic products, right, the card or the current account or the Internet banking or mobile banking solution, would take 15 minutes each. And then it would take 24 hours to activate these accounts. And today, after some changes and projects we did, it takes 3 to 5 minutes to do everything. So we improved massively the time spent with the customers and with the onboarding procedure because how can you imagine a happy customer when he spends half of his day onboarding, right? I mean the start should be the most happy point. So this is something in that direction.</p><p>This is very interesting in my opinion, and this is something which came from Nino's exercise with data analytics and data science. Basically, one of the use cases we had for SMEs was to understand if we can implement this subscription model with the businesses. So we know all these big names, right? This is why I used it just to remind you on your most probably subscriptions with Netflix or Amazon Prime or Spotify, right? One would pay a one -- I don't know, fee per month or per year and then would get a certain package for free or with certain benefits. This is exactly what we did. Basically, we identified the customers which transact with the bank most actively. We understood what type of package they would need, and now we are actively onboarding them into this subscription service. Basically, we launched B Com. B Com is kind of a club where people would buy a subscription and join the club. In this subscription, they would have a certain product set which would come for free, for instance, ATM withdrawal for free and some other transfers like several transfers for free per month and per period. And this is like B Fix. It is for generic use. Then we have our agro-specific subscription and then for premium customers. And this is all based on heavily on data analytics. We already have -- we launched a couple of weeks ago. We already have something around 1,000 customers onboarded. And I mean we will massively push on it because we do believe that the customers should not be spending their energy and time on understanding how much fees they pay or when they pay them, which fee it was and so on and so on. They should just pay one fee, and that's it. The model is quite innovative because there are not many examples within Eastern Europe which would bring SME and business customers to subscription base because in banking, basically, we still charge basically different fees, right? All these neobanks and Space type of banks, right, they would do the subscription. But the traditional retail banking and the business banking model would still differentiate per fees. And we think that this trial will give us better consumer experience and more trust with the customers.</p><p>Yes. Just a quick summary on this. This is our traditional business support, nonfinancial services. We do a lot in this regard because we believe that being the best business supporter is something which positions us very well with the customers. With business education, we already have almost 15,000 trained businesses, trained 1,300 startups. We perform this business award, which is kind of Oscars, for best businesses in Georgia, and we already had 1,500 participants. And in the education -- no, it's a mistake, it should be startup program. We have already 24,000 startups participating in our startup program. And we granted loan to 490, which is the amount of GEL 102 million loan portfolio, and these are different things. We finance, for instance -- as the tourism industry grows, we finance hotels, we finance smaller companies and many others. We have special dedicated programs for this.</p><p>This is something interesting we launched last year. And last year, I just mentioned it, and here, we already have results. The purpose here was to understand if there are any technology solutions for businesses in Georgia. And if there are not many, somehow to promote it, basically to create a platform, a classified platform where customers' businesses could compare different solutions, would it be accounting, invoicing or others, payroll or expense management solutions and compare them with each other and choose the one and then approach the provider and basically contract. So basically, we already have 53 vendors and then 60 tools, and we definitely saw the increase of the platform in terms of numbers because we basically promote this platform within our 130,000 customer base so that they go on the platform and choose the best service for their use. And this, again, serves a better experience for the customers and more digitalization in their businesses.</p><p>One of the last slides. Yes, this is quite a heavy, heavy, heavy visual. However, what I wanted to show here is -- this was also presented last year is the ecosystem view we have for our customers. So in the middle, we have the customer. Around the first layer is the segments we serve, right, agro business, micro startups, mature businesses. Then the next layer is the channels we use to serve the customers, then are the products basically -- no, the service model basically how we serve them, relationship management or the call center or digital self-service and so on. And the last layer is exactly the ecosystem layer where we would think about different solutions, how to basically surround the customer with those solutions and make him maximally happy with us so that the stickiness will grow, the loyalty will grow and the churn will decrease.</p><p>And in this regard, we are doing some exercises. For this year -- and this is just a quick summary of the whole presentation, where basically the whole accent this year in 2019, and of course, this will flow over to the next years, is to make sure that we are properly positioned. And everything I told you, properly positioned means that we are now trying to create a web platform where we will have everything on the same platform for the customer. Just a good example would be in Google, right? On the Google page, you have on the right side the click, and you have all the solutions of Google, right, Google Docs, Google PowerPoint and all the stuff. So something like this. So we want all our solutions to be on one portal so the customer can go there and onboard on any of them and find it easy to onboard.</p><p>Distribution channel mix. So what we are improving and renewing and reshuffling is the Internet mobile banking, and we are working now on the business financial management tool basically, which will help the customers to analyze their expense structure better. The next one is the processes where we invest a lot of time in web sales. So we target to build a web sales engine where we will be selling online with the online lending pages, which is not the practice now in the country, but we will pilot it this year. Now lending automation, David also was mentioning this, we target to be very fast in lending, to improve the reaction time to cash and to build special document flow and process flow systems for this. And the front-end optimization. Front-end optimization basically is directly hitting this 3 to 5 minutes onboarding process and all the same type of things. Why? Because if the process which the operator or the banking employee runs through the computer is heavy, then how can we imagine him or her serving the customer easily, right? Because we have to have the same UX and UI on the both ends, on the customer end and on the banking end.</p><p>And the last one is exactly from the ecosystem slide. We are currently working on the accounting and invoicing solutions where we would facilitate the interaction of our customers with these solutions. Basically, we will build an accounting platform and an invoicing platform. Just a figure for invoicing, we -- by analyzing, we understood that 50% of our customers would invoice each other within TBC basically. But now they are doing it from outer sources, right? So the invoice would go out, per e-mail, per whatever Excel simple format, and then it will land again into the TBC accounts. What we want, we want to connect the network, and this is exactly called the network effects, right? If we create value within the network, the customers will stick to the network, and they will churn less.</p><p>This is in natural the strategy and the key points for MSME. And of course, on the questions and answers, I'll be happy to answer. Thank you.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Thank you, Niko. So last but not least, we will now talk about our relatively young but dynamically developing insurance business. So I hand it over to Paata Gadzadze.</p><p>PAATA GADZADZE, CEO OF TBC INSURANCE, TBC BANK GROUP PLC: Good evening, sir, and ladies and gentlemen. I'll do my best to be shorter and to take care about your time, and then we take care -- I'll do my best to make life easier to our investors as well, not only our customers.</p><p>So very brief about the performance of last year and some indications about the current situation in insurance business. As you see, the penetration of total insurance market is -- the insurance activities in the GDP is still very low, and it's promising because it's growing very rapidly. And the dynamic is shown here is that the portion of health and nonhealth is -- the health insurance is more or less the same. But in absolute amount, the property and casualty in nonhealth insurance is quite -- has increased quite rapidly.</p><p>As for the breakdown by products, health is -- remains around 40%. Motor Casco is about 24%, and the next one is property. And in life and property -- in life and personal accident, mostly the biggest driver is still banking sector and its credit-linked related products.</p><p>Totally, in Georgia, there are 17 insurance companies. Last year, personally, I remember that I promised to become the #1 insurance companies. And usually, TBC keeps its words and promise, and I'll tell you that out of these 17 companies, the TBC became the biggest growing company and really marketing maker in retail insurers. And we will see it in the next slides, this -- how we are keeping these promises.</p><p>So here we are. Market share in retail, we are almost 38%, and in total market share, we are second biggest maintaining 20%. Still we have challenges in business and corporate and SME part. But we should underline here that TBC Insurance is not at all focused on state- and government-related insurance. And therefore, we don't have here the biggest market share, and we have a very conservative approach on corporate side. And still we will maintain -- I mean our strategy is more focused on nonstate insurance part.</p><p>Here, we have updated version. It's even more market share in almost 40% of quarter 1 in retail and around 22% in total market share. So even within quarter base, it's changed quite rapidly.</p><p>Here, we've shown the second -- I mean our main competitor who has more than 35 -- 32 years history in insurance activity in Georgia. And we are quite young, like 2.5 years ago, we established our new brand insurance. And so you can see here the gap, how the gap decreased in -- between us and how the gap increased in retail market with our peer competitor.</p><p>As for our TBC Insurance breakdown by products and channels, thanks to Nino and she's very -- quite a good -- I mean the engagement in starting the designing the very comprehensive Bancassurance platform. And thanks to all these efforts, we maintained a very good platform, IT and including the staff -- that includes staff training and so on. Still we have a 48% in Bancassurance, the true Bancassurance, which is not at all related to the mandatory sales, but it's only Bancassurance. We will see how the mandatory credit-related portion is decreasing year-by-year and even quarter-by-quarter. So still we have a -- and the retail portion is 1 quarter, and the business, including corporate and SME, is 1 quarter.</p><p>As for the products, here, the domination is -- has motor. Life and personal accident is increasing, and even noncredit related also is increasing portion. Here is the composition.</p><p>This slide shows the performance for last year, so you can see the premium for last 2.5 years and quarter-by-quarter. And in both, I mentioned, in growing -- how we are growing our business, and in profitability as well is quite significant. And we are proud that we keep all these financial targets and risk targets also. And keeping these targets and maintaining the highest profitability is pretty much impressive.</p><p>Here, we can see that which channels are used for each direction of products. I would say that TBC Insurance, leveraging all these IT technologies and the competence in digitalization, we are the leaders in insurance market. All others are mostly using all the traditional approaches in both side, in risk scoring and in sales. And TBC is -- right now is doing a lot -- investing a lot in technologies, and we are very proud that the second bot, B Bot, we call it, sells almost 100% of small-ticket insurance like including travel insurance, I mean where we are -- where we don't pay any commission, which is not a usual case in -- not only in our case but in -- globally. So it's very simplified procedures, and all the digitalization is on place here.</p><p>And here, I would mention that the last slide was very impressive that -- oop, sorry. Too much again. Offloading ratio. For last year, we managed to reach 43% of all policies sold, offloading ratio, mostly in Casco and small-ticket insurance. Mostly this is Casco, personal insurance and travel insurance. So it's very high even to the local -- even to the Western standards, especially in insurance.</p><p>These are our midterm targets. Still we have biggest ambitions to maintain in total market share, not only in retail but in total market share, more than 30% and then keeping combined ratio less than 80%. Offloading, even more than 50%. And for sure, as we are the service company as the TBC has a strategic focus on NPS, more than 65%.</p><p>And the last -- the second part and the last slides are focused on health insurance. Year -- a month ago, we launched health insurance focused only on private, high, well-paid individuals, not in retail but it's B2B. Again, our target is to make -- to create a 5-star health insurance companies. We are focused on this 5 -- I mentioned that the #1 market share on premium segment in sizable -- I mean by numbers of insured this year, 50,000 more. Best customer experience, innovation in services, including those digitalization, of course, in claims service, which is very important in health insurance as well. And keeping also the financial effectiveness and -- targets of financial effectiveness, including loss ratios and combined ratios. Thank you so much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Now the wine tasting.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Not just yet. Not just yet. All right. This is the last presentation. We'd like to open the floor again for questions. Yes, Mikha in the back there.</p><p>MIKHAIL SHLEMOV: I wanted to ask about the consumer lending regulations, especially the part which was related to the income verification. I think it was said in the risk management part that some part of the bankable -- previous bankable population was left out of in euros. Perhaps if you could provide an estimate of what part of the population you think is coming from bankable. This is the first part.</p><p>And the second part is relating actually to the micro segment where I would assume the majority of borrowers are also similar individual persons. However, I guess -- and whatever, you are now also obliged to make an income verification in the segment as well. And depending on answer, on whatever you have seen basically, immigration of the clients between the consumer -- between the retail lending and the micro lending.</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA: So on the first question, there are a number of -- there are some customer groups that are -- will just be unable to prove -- to provide verification. There will be customer groups -- there will be product types as well that will not be able to be done and be underwritten, and so we have changed sort of some of the products in the bank as well. But those types of products just will not be -- will not work under new regulation. So it's things like this that's on the fringes.</p><p>And then I would say that on micro -- in micro, actually, we have been doing sort of verification of income of borrowers. So in fact, the regulator has used the approaches that banks have in micro as the potential role model for how things can be done on the retail side as well.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Andrew? Andreas (inaudible)?</p><p>ANDREAS MARKOU, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER &amp; CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Andreas from Berenberg. One question for David to start off. So to -- but maybe we can go to Giorgi. Okay. So to what extent can you use the big data you will be collecting from the ecosystems to improve your scoring models? How much do you think you can actually improve your cost of risk through this extra data? And then 2 questions for Giorgi. First one, what is the potential impact of the bond issuance on your margins? And second, on regulation, so we've seen a lot of regulation in Georgia this year. What is left to come?</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA: I think definitely, we'll be -- we want to use and we will be using data. Let's start collecting the data. Let's start to look at what kind of data we collect. We're definitely going to be using it. And then maybe next time around, we'll have something more specific on the impact from the financial side of that thing.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Yes. On the margins, I think we need to say kind of -- initially -- the first quarter when we held the bonds and in the medium-term impact, initially it's going to be 10, 20 basis points. And then over time, it's -- the impact will diminish. It won't be very material. And obviously we see lots of benefits there from the perspective of diversifying our funding source and improving the -- net stable funding ratio, which is good, but still.</p><p>With regards to the second part, I mean I think the other regulation we are hearing which will happen is about the net stable funding ratio introduction. We did do internal assessment, and based on the assessment, we don't see any material impact on TBC. Also we are hearing -- and this is also reasonable to expect that over time, when we see how the regulation impacted the book, we might see fine-tuning, especially specific areas such as, I don't know, mortgages. There are 60,000 mortgages in the country. And we might see fine-tuning and improvement within certain groups.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Okay. Next question, gentleman in the middle.</p><p>OWEN CALLAN, HEAD OF FINANCIALS RESEARCH &amp; BANKING ANALYST, INVESTEC BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Owen Callan from Investec. I know earlier you spoke about Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan specifically as markets you're entering by the retail bank mainly both from the Insurance division or the CIB division. Is there plans to go outside Georgia as well over maybe medium term into those countries or other countries neighboring Georgia? And then a second question is on regulation. I was wondering, is there any sort of -- obviously, U.S. and European banks would -- EU banks would be stress tested and part of stress testing cycle. Is there a similar kind of cycle that the Georgian authorities have? And just maybe if you could explain that to us or if there is anything like that.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Maybe I can answer on Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan. I think our target in both countries of Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan is, firstly, digital as much asset light as possible. And secondly, our target customer base is retail and SME. So we are not or we will not be targeting the corporate customers. And that's regarding on both.</p><p>Within the financial offering and, again, digital offering, you never exclude insurance offering across those countries. And in fact, a lot of ecosystems that we discussed today are scalable, and it's very easy that these ecosystems should deploy on -- across other countries. And for sure, as we progress, we see more offering across these countries.</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA: On stress testing, so our regulator, the National Bank of Georgia, has an annual sort of comprehensive stress testing program of banks. It's been -- there had been 2 years, 2 iterations of the stress tests, so last year and the year before. And it's a holistic stress test that all banks have to do and submit to the regulators. So that would be the equivalent. And the stress test going forward will also be linked the new capital setting -- capital framework that we have in there. There's a specific stress test buffer in the framework. Yes.</p><p>I just wanted to add one thing on the data question as well, actually. Just one sort of example, sound bite. Even though right now our scorecards are working with 1,300 data points in our spending data, credit history data, et cetera, et cetera. But we always look -- so for example, just now there's a process ongoing in Space where we have potentially -- are thinking that the number of taps that a customer is doing on the phone could potentially be predictive of certain types of behaviors. So we're testing that type of data right now to see if it can be a useful addition to the analysis. So it always -- it's an ongoing process all the time. And so we'll see what we get. I imagine we're going to be getting a wealth of data from ecosystems. Yes.</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Maybe a little remark on stress test. Firstly, we are very well capitalized, I mean in terms of equity-to-asset ratio. So we are about 15% as the banking sector. And secondly, there was a statement that reminded me by NBG just stating that the -- after the stress test result, NBG sees that the system is worth lending the stress tests that they defined. And usually, they do define quite conservative stress tests and approaches.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Andrew? Andrew, yes.</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY: Yes. Just a brief follow-up on the PTI. We basically saw retail lending contracting for you guys quite strongly and I think for the sector as a whole. I mean is there a risk of a real kind of slowdown, kind of credit crunch in retail lending because of the introduction of PTI? And do you think kind of having had this for a little while now, that the threshold the National Bank has kind of got it right? Or really, the thresholds are too strict and that there is this risk of a major slowdown basically?</p><p>NINO MASURASHVILI: So since we already have 200,000 thresholds and all consumer loans mainly are withdrawn in general. So PTI for consumer lending, it is not right way like it's major preventer. The main thing here is income verification because just imagine, when we're issuing, let's say 1,000 credit card or 1,000 POS loan in -- out of the branches, and it's becoming really very difficult to go and to check and verify the income by the physical, which was previously done by the preapproving loan lending and this (inaudible), et cetera. So we think that at some point, I guess that the NBG will be ready in the future because there is such a type of talk that they will be using some income verification models, et cetera. So we are like adopting -- the banks, all the banks on the market adopting to find a different method of verification to income compared to what we had today. But PTI, in general, it is quite normal and it is not that we can prevent. In the USD dollar, where we are dispersing the mortgage loan, then PTI is really preventing the mortgage lending in dollars term. But for consumer loans, it is not a big preventer.</p><p>ANDREW KEELEY: Okay. And this is -- unplugs our space (inaudible) for quick loan approval. Was that including income verification?</p><p>GIORGI SHAGIDZE: Yes.</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA: Yes.</p><p>NINO MASURASHVILI: It's payable.</p><p>DAVID CHKONIA: It is the same thing we just use the process, which is fully automated.</p><p>PAATA GADZADZE: If I may to add on credit crunch, so I think the appetite of Central Bank is pretty similar, pretty same word to what's described as the guidelines, so up to 15% credit growth. And again, NBG stated several times that they stand ready to amend regulations if they see credit slowing more than what was expected. Also you see same statements from IMF. They continue to say that the dynamics should be monitored carefully, et cetera. And as Giorgi mentioned, there was already first message on mortgages. The last statement was not only that they are monitoring, but they are monitoring specifically also mortgage segment. So I would say the probability of credit crunch is very low.</p><p>ZOLTAN SZALAI: Any more questions? Okay. Well, then this is I guess the end of the formal part of the afternoon. So now we can proceed to Georgian winetasting. And again, we thank you very much for coming.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

TD Ameritrade's bottom line came in at 44 cents a share, above Wall Street estimates for 41 cents a share, despite lower trading commissions. The company was boosted by new account growth and asset-based revenue -- total revenue rose 11% from the prior year to $931 million, eclipsing forecasts for $899.5 million.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TheStreet talked with TD Ameritrade CEO Tim Hockey about the quarter and overall trading environment.\u00a0What follows is a condensed and edited version of our conversation.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Question: The Scottrade acquisition closes soon - do you anticipate a need to get even larger?</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> The closing is still on track: We said Sept. 30, and we're hoping to advance that by a month or so. We literally only have the Federal Reserve and the Canadian bank regulator left to opine. In terms of additional M&amp;A, we've got pretty enormous scale post Scottrade, over $1 trillion in assets and over 10 million in client accounts. Scale used to be an incredibly important thing in any business, but my general philosophy is that scale past a certain size tends to be less important than it used to be: A) because it drives you to be slower just because you're a larger firm and speed is very important, and B) because smaller players can now almost mimic scale at a very early stage in their development.</p><p>The examples everybody likes to talk about are Airbnb having more hotel rooms and actually not having a hotel at all and Uber being [one of the world's largest car companies] yet they don't actually have any cars. These are companies that have [amassed] global scale very quickly. To me, speed in the last number of years has become more important than sheer scale once you get past a certain size, and we've passed that size.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: We are seeing such a strong appetite by investors for top tech names. How much is interest in tech stocks fueling Ameritrade?</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> Clearly, the traditional FANG (Facebook  , Apple  , Netflix  and Google  ) stocks are the ones that drive retail. We had a broader retail engagement, and retail clients, as you know, tend to trade those things that they know. They trade the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/14232962/1/netflix-s-blowout-quarter-just-pushed-reed-hastings-net-worth-past-2-billion.html\">brands that they know</url> -- they trade Netflix  , they trade Amazon  , Nvidia  was a big trader this particular quarter.</p><p>These are all brands, consumer brands that, notably, our millennial and active traders like to talk about because they know them.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Your average trades per day surged to about 510,000 despite trading declines at some of the big Wall Street firms amid lower volatility. How did you pull that off?</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A:</emphasis> It's a bit of a conundrum. If you look at how the numbers were mathematically generated, there was an uptick in net new accounts generated this [fiscal] year, and literally, in the first three quarters, we did more than we did in all of last year. That then led to a total of about 6% growth in the actual number of accounts, and on average, those accounts traded a little more than they did last year. It was the combination of those three trailing factors that we were up 10% year-over-year.</p><p>With a 30% reduction in [online stock and ETF trade commissions, from $9.99 to $6.95 in March], the impact was offset by larger account numbers times more trades, which means that it literally was only a one-cent year-over-year impact on commission revenue.</p><p>I wouldn't have thought lower pricing would drive more trading because we didn't think the pricing sensitivity of retail clients at these low levels was such that a lower price drives more activity, but there might be a factor in that.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brian Sozzi contributed to this story.</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url> .

That said, the DOJ inquiry seems to focus more on behavior than on dealmaking, as David Hatch pointed out to us this AM. The DOJ says it's reviewing \"practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\" That's not to say the trustbusters won't challenge deals they fear will stifle innovation. What does that, however, is subject to dispute, as David has explained. DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim himself has belittled some aggressive thinking on this question as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14941958/index.dl|\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/14941958/index.dl|</url>\"hipster\" antitrust.\" Meanwhile, the FTC announced       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html|a\">https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html|a</url> settlement with Facebook over charges of mishandling user data that will see the company pay a $5B fine.

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>. One       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-26/coronavirus-tracing-app-fascinating-test/12181404\">senior journalist</url> described the app as a \"test\" for Australians.  Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls.

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's their personal information, of course, so they can do with it whatever they like, but it makes it more difficult for them to assure those sources who wish to remain anonymous that they are doing everything they can to keep their communications confidential -- unless they avoid using their phones for any interaction with sources, which is the best-practice method.  Phones, after all, are just a surveillance device that you can use for phone calls. Indeed a phone with bluetooth on and the screen permanently unlocked -- which the COVID-19 app needs to function effectively -- is a spy or a hacker's wet dream.  Some in the media have gone further. They have compared people with privacy concerns to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-a-covid-tracing-app-convert-barnaby-you-brought-me-to-my-senses-20200424-p54n0v.html\">terrorists</url>, to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6152259538001\">anti-vaxxers</url>, or called them       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/meek-in-a-crisis-rush-to-download-reveals-true-australian-character-20200427-p54nnt.html\">\"Twitter cranks and contrarians\"</url>.

Even those deeply concerned about the threat of government surveillance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/i-m-more-worried-about-mark-zuckerberg-than-this-government-and-its-tracing-app-20200428-p54nu6.html\">have argued</url> that big tech companies are worse than any government app. Many outlets have reported with an air of triumph about the rapid take-up of the app, although there's been less of that in the past 24 hours as the initial surge has faded.  The view of app advocates in the media is, perhaps, understandable: they want to play their part in getting Australia through this unprecedented -- at least in the lifetime of anyone under 100 -- crisis. They're working for \"Team Australia\" because \"we're all in this together\". A little cheerleading for the government, if it helps improve uptake of the app, is worth it -- after all \"the life you save could be your own\", etc.  Journalists are being pandemic patriots rather than crisis curmudgeons.  One problem with this is that it essentially destroys the media's argument against further extensions of government powers of surveillance and control in relation to national security matters. There is very little difference between public health and national security: in both cases the media must take the government's word about the nature of the public threat, and in both cases governments claim the right to infringe basic freedoms and hide from scrutiny (remember the refusal to release modelling because it might frighten people?) on the basis of public interest.  Next time the government wants to give itself new powers to collect information, or surveil the population, or undermine cybersecurity, the mainstream media cannot object. Haven't they led the way in urging the population to surrender some privacy for the public benefit against an insidious threat the government wants to protect us against?  Indeed, hasn't the media compared privacy advocates to terrorists -- a practice normally reserved for politicians who like to argue anyone resistant to the loss of basic freedoms is on the side of terrorists or pedophiles -- and suggested they're as delusional as anti-vaxxers? Aren't the tech giants much much worse anyway?  The next extension of surveillance powers so the government can better track down journalists' sources will be a test for the media: whose side are they really on?  The broader problem is that it's not the media's role to be pandemic patriots. It is the job of the media to hold the powerful -- and particularly governments -- to account. At a time when governments are handing themselves truly extraordinary powers of coercion and withdrawing basic freedoms from the population, this is more the case than at any time in recent decades.   When it proposes to place a surveillance app on the phone of -- it hopes -- the entire population, the case for vigorous interrogation of its proposal is especially strong.  Some ABC journalists, to their credit, have done their job.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-24/amazon-to-provide-cloud-services-for-coronavirus-tracing-app/12176682\">Linton Besser and Dylan Welch</url> have exposed the fact that data from the app was within reach of US security agencies courtesy of far-reaching US laws that presume to override those of other countries.   In doing so they also exposed the distressing fact that Australian politicians and bureaucrats knew much less about US laws\u00a0 and their extraterritorial intent than journalists did.  This has been something of an exception at the ABC which has enthusiastically adopted a \"Team Australia\" approach to its coverage, including senior journalists criticising Australians for failing to rigidly adhere to the often absurdly draconian lockdown laws imposed by state governments.  It's not merely the nature of the powers governments are arrogating during the crisis that necessitates journalists being watchdogs rather than cheerleaders.   The media itself, enduring an existential crisis that is smashing its beleaguered business model, faces a future in which it will be more dependent on government favours -- via grants programs and regulatory relief -- than at any time in its history.  The Australian commercial media's future may very well depend on continued government support. This will be a dangerous time for accountability. Will media outlets balk at standing up for press freedom or challenging failed policy or corruption if they perceive it might endanger their success in the next grant round?  The times call for public interest journalism and vigorous watchdogs, not \"Team Australia\" and cheerleader journalists. And that call will only grow stronger as media revenue crumbles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

''And the time's come due for regulation, for structural solutions and for a general cultural rethinking of how to ensure that these platforms are working for us rather than us working for the platforms.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The challenges include increasing concerns about how private data is collected and used; the spreading of false information that could influence the 2020 election, by both foreign and domestic actors on social media; and whether behemoths like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be split up.</p><p>  ''I definitely think we need market regulation,'' said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo. ''I think it's the only way to correct systemic market failures.''</p><p>  But addressing the myriad issues is not a one-time affair. ''I'm worried Congress is thinking that we're going to pass one privacy bill and be done for 20 years,'' he added.</p><p>  And one tool will not resolve all the different and complex issues, said Noah Phillips, commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. First, ''we need to ask what is the harm that we're solving and how does the remedy address that harm?''</p><p>  If the question is competition, he said, then that's what antitrust laws are for. Privacy, on the other hand, will require other approaches. And therein, he and others have said, lies the crux of the dilemma.</p><p>  For there to be any change in how the big technology companies are operating, most agreed that there must be a confluence of several factors: a strong congressional mandate, leadership to address long-term needs, more resources for agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and a public willingness to lose some of the ease and convenience people now get through companies like Amazon.</p><p>  Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit and the only head of a social media company in the room, said: ''When it comes to regulation it's the detail that matters. I don't want to see regulation that's knee-jerk or comes from a position of fear.''</p><p>  But he acknowledged, ''The state of our political discourse is as toxic as it's ever been in my lifetime.''</p><p>  Mr. Huffman said Reddit was not following Twitter's lead in banning political ads -- something Facebook has refused to do. He said he believes such an action favors incumbents, but Reddit is considering enabling comments on all political ads. Currently, those who buy the ads can decide whether or not they are open to comments.</p><p>  Such discussion reflects ''a healthy debate about how we treat political ads in this country,'' Mr. Huffman said. ''While I don't agree with their decisions, I also don't really agree with the status quo.''</p><p>  Some said, though, that the workers inside companies can make a bigger difference than government officials coming in from the outside.</p><p>  ''I've seen more regulation go bad in technology than produce good,'' said Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist and the head of Craig Newmark Foundations. ''I've been working with line workers, grunts, my fellow nerds in these tech companies who are now actively working to try to get their management to do the right thing, and that's beginning to bear fruit.''</p><p>  For Kate Crawford, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, which aims to understand the social implications of artificial intelligence, it isn't a matter of choosing between government intervention or worker and public action, but advocating for both.</p><p>  ''The question isn't whether regulation works or do we need it,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''I think we absolutely need it, but the question we have to ask is 'Is it going to be enough?'''</p><p>  She said collective action by workers at companies like Google, investigations by the news media and institutions like hers were all shining a light on the workings of the major technology companies as never before.</p><p>  On the question of whether the big tech companies should be broken up -- as Elizabeth Warren has advocated in her presidential campaign -- Mr. Hughes said it was now clear that a majority of Americans want that.</p><p>  ''In a time when Republicans and Democrats can't really agree on anything, there seems to be a pretty wide bipartisan consensus that we should be paying more attention to this,'' he said. ''Now the question is, where does that go, and how does that develop over the next year?''</p><p>  But Ms. Crawford warned that breaking technology companies into smaller entities would not necessarily solve the problem.</p><p>  ''If we move from 10 major players to 100 but don't question the underlying business model, is that really going to address this very complex set of problems?'' she asked. ''Why are we not talking about, essentially, the sort of rapacious excavation of everybody's biometric information, location data, the use of everything that is available to train A.I. systems? Why are we not looking at labor practices in terms of contract work forces?''</p><p>  Or as Alexa von Tobel, the founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, noted, ''You can be a really small company with incredible A.I. and quantum computing and owning data of enough people and be very, very dangerous.''</p><p>  While the challenges can seem overwhelming -- and at times the conversation steered toward the apocalyptic -- Mr. Hughes, for one, was optimistic.</p><p>  ''We can get regulation right. We do it with airlines. We do it with pharmaceuticals. We do it with the F.C.C.,'' he said.

Sweet!</p><p>RPA is widely thought of as the simplest form of AI and is used by most of the world's mid to large corporations in functions ranging from office management to the rote tasks of the back office.</p><p>The next phase, ML, introduces some judgement based on adaptation learned over time. Isn't it freaky how much Alexa knows about you? Full-blown AI is the ultimate step, and makes decisions based on ML, deep learning and other secret sauce, and is poised to make the biggest shift once widely adopted.</p><p>The three main RPA providers are Automation Anywhere, UI Path and Blue Prism. The first two offer free trials of their software. I recommend starting basic: Solve for something that needs to be done each month at a certain time, like bank reconciliations or something on the revenue cycle, such as invoicing or A/R.</p><p>There is an investment decision to be made, so be strategic and don't do a moonshot on your first integration. The ROI will come over time.</p><p>Prediction: AI will change the landscape of the profession-from audit to tax to accounting. The finance function of 2030 will be composed of a finance chief who has realtime information available to make decisions, and who relies on a small, but very competent, AI trained finance staff' that, in turn, are able to operate in real time. Accountants will become more like finance product managers.</p><p>Opportunities: In the short term, consider developing an RPA to maximize efficiencies at your own firm or help a client identify ways they can adopt RPA. In the long term, start understanding how you can leverage ML and AI. Caveat: Consider the country or domicile where data is routed through; some might rout through another country, which might subject you to the privacy requirements of that jurisdiction.</p><p>No. 2: Date Privacy</p><p>Countries and jurisdictions will continue their push for governance over data collected by the technology platforms. Examples include Europe's 2018 landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California's 2020 CCPA (California Consumer Protection Act). That's right, thanks to GDPR we now see the \"click accept\" box on every website. Just recently, Facebook delayed the launch of its dating app in Europe, which was planned for release before Valentine's Day. The reason? Ireland's privacy regulator, The Irish Data Protection Commission, raised concerns of the dating app's compliance with GDPR.</p><p>Under GDPR, companies must perform a data process impact assessment before launching a product in Europe. In Facebook's case, there apparently was not enough time between the notification to the Irish Data Protection Commission and the app's go-live date.</p><p>Ireland is tasked with greater privacy governance than other European countries since Dublin is the European corporate home to many technology companies, such as Facebook and Alphabet, the parent of Google. Many have domiciled their intellectual property in Ireland by way of a corporate inversion, due to the favorable Irish tax climate.</p><p>Prediction: In our geopolitical climate, where American technology companies make up a significant component of global equity markets and whose reach is borderless, we should expect to see more countries enforce privacy action and seek ways to boost their revenues via taxation and fees.</p><p>In 2030, countries will be even more keen to maintain their tax base via enforcement. There will be a decade-long game of tug-of-war between big tech and the governments.</p><p>Opportunities: Consulting opportunities include advisory as the privacy concerns relate to the finance function, and includes clients operating purely within the United States (given the emergence of states' own privacy rules, which may be stricter than the federal government) and with your international clients.</p><p>Most of the larger firms have these practice areas in place, but for smaller firms, there are some clear opportunities. As laws continue to change, so do the opportunities. If a client approaches you and asks how the CCPA might affect them, understanding and explaining the fundamentals and specific applicability conveys thought leadership. Our clients do look to us as their adviser in many areas, and these discussions come up.</p><p>Consider partnering with a privacy consultancy to understand scope and costs to comply (and to refer clients to), which will also help you understand potential costs related to legal and compliance and other contingencies that arise when dealing with new privacy rules.</p><p>One last thought: Opt for cyber coverage on your liability policy. It is cheap and worth it. Data breach requirements vary by state, so if you have clients in 50 states, then you potentially have 50 different notification requirements you need to comply with.</p><p>Of course, I have no way of predicting the future. But let's talk in 2030 and compare notes. \u0429</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CALCPA-2384149324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CALCPAMarch 2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJF-YTS1-DY0W-42MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317511</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright March 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright March 2020 California Society of Certified Public Accountants Mar/Apr 2020</copyright><publicationName>California CPA</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 15304035</issn><volume>Vol. 88</volume><issueNumber>No. 8</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Data integrity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Automation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Artificial intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>General Data Protection Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robotics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000155</classCode><className>BACK OFFICE OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM5X</classCode><className>EU DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X57</classCode><className>CONSUMER LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJBNDY2Rjc3Mzk4NDI3NUJDOTlCQTRCNzE2M0IwRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU</classCode><className>Consumer Protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00096KT</classCode><className>BILLING &amp;

Thiel had brought Safra Catz, the co-CEO of Oracle, along to discuss a $10 billion Department of Defense contract to build the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, a cloud computing platform that will eventually run much of the Pentagon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital infrastructure--from data storage to image analytics to the translation of intercepted phone calls. According to\u00c2\u00a0Bloomberg News, Catz objected to the DOD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to award the entire JEDI contract to a single organization, rather than parceling it out to multiple contractors. Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM were all bidding, but Amazon, Catz said, with its massive cloud services business, had an unfair advantage. (Trump, in a rare display of restraint, reportedly said he wanted to ensure a fair competition but went no further.)</p><p>JEDI plays a significant part in the Pentagon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy to ensure that its war-waging capabilities keep pace with technological change, and Amazon is probably best positioned to build it. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web services division (AWS), officially founded in 2006, grew out of a project hatched by two of its employees, Benjamin Black and Chris Pinkham, to use Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing resources to provide technical infrastructure to anyone who might want it--whether a retailer selling their wares through Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platform or someone starting a new company. The initial product, called EC2, helped Amazon launch an entirely new industry, broadly called cloud computing but encompassing a range of services, including data storage, analytics, machine learning, and other tools. While Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaunted retail business frequently lost money over the last decade, AWS has been one of its most reliably profitable divisions, bringing in $5.4 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2018.</p><p>Microsoft, Google, and others eventually started their own cloud computing divisions. But as the competition over JEDI shows, the desire to challenge AWS has led major technology firms into the national security complex, with promises to analyze imagery for drone strikes and to run communications links for soldiers fighting in the Middle East and North Africa. As these companies move into military work, their claims about the benevolent role that technology can play in modern society--already damaged by scandals ranging from Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor exploitation to Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral mismanagement--are running squarely up against the realities of their profit motive.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>In truth, government and the technology industry have always been partners. Some companies, like IBM, have relationships with the military that extend back to World War II. The development of the early internet owes much to resources provided by the Pentagon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced research division, an agency founded in 1958 to counter Soviet expansion into space. Later, during the Cold War, microchips developed by industry pioneers like Fairchild Semiconductor found their way into ballistic missiles. Even Stanford University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise as an engineering and entrepreneurial powerhouse depended heavily on millions of dollars in government funding for high-tech research (a relationship that became controversial during the Vietnam War).</p><p>More recently, Edward Snowden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2013 leaks revealed the tech industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicity in the National Security Agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global surveillance operation. Major companies had complied with--and profited from--government demands for unwarranted data collection. In one telling detail made public by Snowden, Americans learned that even as the NSA was making secret deals with Yahoo and other companies to access customer information, the intelligence community was hacking into those same companies and collecting personal data.</p><p>With the exception of a few notable court challenges to government subpoenas, the Snowden leaks did little to change the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close relationship with the military. Silicon Valley executives like Eric Schmidt still sit on Pentagon advisory boards, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeff Bezos entertains strategically important heads of state like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Despite Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ritual shaming before a congressional committee this past spring, the quasi-governmental reach of these companies remains self-evident.</p><p>Take Palantir, perhaps this era\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paradigmatic tech company, if not also its most controversial. Established in 2004 by Peter Thiel--Trump dinner companion, PayPal co-founder, Facebook board member, and slayer of Gawker Media--Palantir organizes and parses vast amounts of data for corporate and government clients, particularly in the defense and intelligence communities. Considered one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable privately held startups, Palantir was initially funded partly by In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s venture capital arm. This government pedigree has ensured that its products are as popular in Washington as they are in Kabul, where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to track the locations of improvised explosive devices.</p><p>Palantir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lucrative government contracting business is perhaps more overt than some of the other tech giants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from an outlier. Amazon, whose AWS division provides the digital infrastructure for everything from NASA to Netflix, is already the official cloud-computing provider of the CIA. Even before it began competing for JEDI, the company provided similar services to the Defense Department and other government agencies as a subcontractor. Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating systems power millions of DOD devices; in 2016, it earned a $927 million information technology and consulting contract from the department, and in May it announced a deal to provide its Azure Government cloud service to the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Google has dipped into government contracting, too, though not without internal resistance. This spring, more than 3,000 Google employees signed a letter of protest, and roughly a dozen resigned, in response to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in Project Maven, which provides image analysis technology used in drone strikes to the Air Force. (Google announced in June that it would not renew the contract.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon has attracted a great deal of scrutiny for its enduring march toward retail monopoly, but in reality, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future now rests as much in securing the top-secret data of CIA activities as it does in delivering groceries--a spectacular broadening of its reach, which ought to bring up questions about whether Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share buys it the same leverage in the federal government as it does in the retail economy.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>It should perhaps come as no surprise that the government, for its part, would seek out the data and expertise of Big Tech. (Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter held regular meetings with Silicon Valley VIPs while serving in the Obama administration.) Only the large firms have the capacity to build and manage the secure databases and sophisticated computer networks that governmental bureaucracies need to operate. And these companies, in collecting so much user data, present a tempting opportunity for intelligence agencies looking to expand the scope of their mass surveillance; the NSA and others want the same data these companies collect in the normal course of business. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the technology companies are obliged to respond to the call for government cooperation, nor do they necessarily need to rush willingly into the defense industry.</p><p>Much has changed since the first ties between the government and technology companies were forged during World War II. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech giants have immense influence over everything from social media to restaurant reviews, autonomous vehicles to health care. They are some of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable, and often most admired, companies, with interests deeply intertwined with the global economy. And while contracts like JEDI may comprise a growing share of their profits, the government probably needs tech firms more than they need the government. Because the DOD and others rely so heavily on their tools, they could, in theory, resist invasive data requests. They have the power, and the ethical obligation, to decide what kind of companies they want to be and, increasingly, to help decide what sort of country the United States should be.</p><p>That, ultimately, is why the fight to win the JEDI contract represents something larger than the profit margins and stock prices of Silicon Valley firms: It is a crossroads at which tech companies will be forced to choose whether they can feasibly continue to preach the values of liberal-minded innovation and independence from big government while serving as its well-paid and compliant partners. It may be unrealistic to expect large, profit-seeking corporations--the Everything Store exists to create loyal consumers, after all--to decline work that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s both wildly remunerative and earns them outsize influence with the very entities that wield the power to regulate them. But it is fair to expect that these companies would act with the ethical standards they so proudly claim to uphold. In recent years, monopolistic tech giants have reaped fantastic gains in efficiency and cost savings, often at the expense of individual privacy and labor rights. To add \u00e2\u20ac\u0153war profiteer\u00e2\u20ac to that list would only further diminish an industry that, with equal parts na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9 and swagger, has so often failed at trying to do good.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>JACOB SILVERMAN\u00c2\u00a0is the author of\u00c2\u00a0Terms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a9 2018, The New Republic</p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u201a</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWRPB-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWRPB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKD-VMW1-JBRW-C005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154997</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New Republic, LLC</copyright><publicationName>The New Republic</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 1, 2018 - August 1, 2018</dateText><date day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"/></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We need these leaders to educatepolicymakers about the difference they can make to accelerate and protect the latest innovations, whether those come from well-established companies or entrepreneurs and startups.</p><p>Thats why last week we brought more than 30 tech entrepreneurs to Capitol Hill for #CTATechWeek. Small business owners and tech CEOs from across the country spoke with members of Congress and their staffs about modernizing our immigration laws, cracking down on abusive patent trolls and approving the Trans Pacific Partnership.</p><p>In addition to these face-to-face meetings with policymakers, we use Consumer Technology Association (CTA) startup member Phone2Actions civic engagement platform year-round to ensure the government doesnt stop the next big tech innovation from ever happening. Phone2Action allows our member companies and tech advocates to connect to policymakers via email, phone and social media. By coordinating outreach across our platforms, were able to amplify advocates voices and have a greater effect on issues that matter on the state and the federal level.</p><p>Just last summer, our members urged California Governor Jerry Brown to veto a bill that threatened to inhibit drone innovation. The campaign garnered about 1,400 emails to Gov. Brown, and the bill was vetoed two weeks later. We have also influenced ridesharing laws in Virginia, Illinois and Nevada and stood up against Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hoods online censorship of Google search terms.</p><p>Over a nine-day span in 2015, we used Phone2Actions platform to rally a diverse coalition of businesses, industry associations and tech enthusiasts across the country to help end a work slowdown at the nations West Coast ports.

The multibillionaire chief executive of Epic Games has opened a multi-front war on the tribute that app developers are forced to pay to reach smartphone users.On the first front, Epic offered app users a less expensive way to pay for in-game weapons in its mega-popular game Fortnite, incurring the wrath of the giants who siphon money from these transactions. According[1] to the Wall Street Journal, 'Apple and Google pulled 'Fortnite' from their app stores Thursday after Mr. Sweeney's Epic rolled out a new way of making in-game purchases thatcircumvents the 30% cut[2]the tech giants take from digital transactions within apps\u2014a percentage established in Apple's case more than a decade ago and some developers have called to reduce for years.'On the second front, Epic Games quickly filed a lawsuit against Apple, calling the smartphone/tablet manufacturer 'the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation.' </p><p>Epic even illustrated it position in the conflict with a terrific parody[3] of Apple's famous 1984 commercial, where, in 2020 Apple is now the IBM Big Brother dominant oppressor.It doesn't help that Apple has truly become the IBM or Microsoft-style market presence Steve Jobs used to love fighting - a financial giant, making most of its money by leveraging long-established dominant market positions. In 2020, rather than inventing new insanely great products, Apple makes billions draining 30% of the revenue from developers operating through its app store.Apple requires that all apps for its phone customers be purchased through its Apple App Store, a policy decried by the U.S. Supreme Court[4] as a violation of anti-trust laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's 'Services revenue\u2014which includes the App Store, plus Apple Music and AppleCare, among other businesses\u2014jumped 15% to $13.16 billion last quarter.'Google yanked Epic's app from the Android stores as well. Epic reacted by immediately filing suit against Google, claiming the search company is'using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize.'Sweeney is uniquely situated to fight these industry leaders as his games have massive consumer followings, Epic has several important income streams like the Unreal Engine for developing games, and the company is closely held and so less vulnerable to public and shareholder pressures.The other front in this war will be fought in new retail business models. Epic games opened its own digital computer game store in 2018, collecting 12% of sales revenue from developers. Currently this store deals primarily in console-based games, competing with online game markets Steam and itch.io[5]. Don't be surprised if Epic makes a move to smartphone apps as well, breaking the current duopoly, opening up a new revenue stream for Epic, and providing access to new markets at a lower price for game developers. Sweeney may need help from courts or Congress to achieve this goal.Epic Games has already forced important sandbox-busting changes in the gaming industry, leveraging its leading Fortnite game to force big game console manufacturers like Sony to open its formerly locked platform to cross device play. As Polygon wrote[6] about this battle, 'Sony has given in, becauseFortniteis now dominant. You can play it on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS devices or on certain Android devices. And anyone can either play against the community on their device, or join the huge pool of players in cross-platform play. OnlyMinecraftrivals it in terms of games that have become part of the gaming monoculture.'With increasing calls for regulation of big tech and with Congress grilling the tech giant CEOs, Sweeney may have found the perfect time to play the anti-trust card against his rivals. All of Sweeney''s time playing strategy games may pay off if this war turns against Apple and Google.[View source[7].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-fortnites-founder-tim-sweeney-is-fighting-apple-google-11597447722\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-fortnites-founder-tim-sweeney-is-fighting-apple-google-11597447722</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-creator-aims-to-bypass-apple-google-fees-11597333613\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-creator-aims-to-bypass-apple-google-fees-11597333613</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-allows-antitrust-suit-against-apple-to-proceed-11557757089\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-allows-antitrust-suit-against-apple-to-proceed-11557757089</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__itch.io&amp;#38;d=DwMFaQ&amp;#38;c=L5E2d05je37i-dadkViuXA&amp;#38;r=UHeQQRzMW99vYypKbKl_Ffjcr8yrK-S859KioZ_cuG4&amp;#38;m=Zac5NjiTHwc3QpTTHYXNHo_-orAA8qcYp1zp2Qht8JQ&amp;#38;s=lDc3yjX81wNFh3KJK4CkqWXbQz8U-spJrpns-SwlhPM&amp;#38;e=\">https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__itch.io&amp;#38;d=DwMFaQ&amp;#38;c=L5E2d05je37i-dadkViuXA&amp;#38;r=UHeQQRzMW99vYypKbKl_Ffjcr8yrK-S859KioZ_cuG4&amp;#38;m=Zac5NjiTHwc3QpTTHYXNHo_-orAA8qcYp1zp2Qht8JQ&amp;#38;s=lDc3yjX81wNFh3KJK4CkqWXbQz8U-spJrpns-SwlhPM&amp;#38;e=</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/26/17905770/fortnite-cross-play-ps4-nintendo-switch-xbox\">https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/26/17905770/fortnite-cross-play-ps4-nintendo-switch-xbox</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://heydatadata.com/2020/08/18/tech-anti-trust-fight-is-more-than-a-game/\">https://heydatadata.com/2020/08/18/tech-anti-trust-fight-is-more-than-a-game/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411159781145973225876100029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-8PG1-JCMN-Y3NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>4:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Claypoole[1] Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP[2] HeyDataData[3] Tim Sweeney, the Colossus of Cary, is fighting even bigger foes - Apple and Google. The multibillionaire chief executive of Epic Games has opened a multi-front war on the tribute that app developers are forced to pay to reach smartphone users.On the first front, Epic offered app users a less expensive way to pay for in-game weapons in its mega-popular game Fortnite, incurring the wrath of the giants who siphon money from these transactions. According[4]to the Wall Street Journal, 'Apple and Google pulled 'Fortnite' from their app stores Thursday after Mr. Sweeney's Epic rolled out a new way of making in-game purchases thatcircumvent the 30% cut[5]the tech giants take from digital transactions within apps\u2014a percentage established in Apple's case more than a decade ago and some developers have called to reduce for years.'On the second front, Epic Games quickly filed a lawsuit against Apple, calling the smartphone/tablet manufacturer 'the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation.' </p><p>Epic even illustrated it position in the conflict with aterrific parody[6]of Apple's famous 1984 commercial, where, in 2020 Apple is now the IBM Big Brother dominant oppressor.It doesn't help that Apple has truly become the IBM or Microsoft-style market presence Steve Jobs used to love fighting - a financial giant, making most of its money by leveraging long-established dominant market positions. In 2020, rather than inventing new insanely great products, Apple makes billions draining 30% of the revenue from developers operating through its app store.Apple requires that all apps for its phone customers be purchased through its Apple App Store, a policy decried by theU.S. Supreme Court[7]as a violation of anti-trust laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's 'Services revenue\u2014which includes the App Store, plus Apple Music and AppleCare, among other businesses\u2014jumped 15% to $13.16 billion last quarter.'Google yanked Epic's app from the Android stores as well. Epic reacted by immediately filing suit against Google, claiming the search company is'using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize.'Sweeney is uniquely situated to fight these industry leaders as his games have massive consumer followings, Epic has several important income streams like the Unreal Engine for developing games, and the company is closely held and so less vulnerable to public and shareholder pressures.The other front in this war will be fought in new retail business models. Epic Games opened its own digital computer game store in 2018, collecting 12% of sales revenue from developers. Currently, this store deals primarily in console-based games, competing with online game markets Steam anditch.io[8]. Don't be surprised if Epic makes a move to smartphone apps as well, breaking the current duopoly, opening up a new revenue stream for Epic, and providing access to new markets at a lower price for game developers. Sweeney may need help from courts or Congress to achieve this goal.Epic Games has already forced important sandbox-busting changes in the gaming industry, leveraging its leading Fortnite game to force big game console manufacturers like Sony to open its formerly locked platform to cross-device play. AsPolygon wrote[9]about this battle, 'Sony has given in, becauseFortniteis now dominant. You can play it on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS devices, or on certain Android devices. And anyone can either play against the community on their device, or join the huge pool of players in cross-platform play. OnlyMinecraftrivals it in terms of games that have become part of the gaming monoculture.'With increasing calls for regulation of big tech and with Congress grilling the tech giant CEOs, Sweeney may have found the perfect time to play the anti-trust card against his rivals. All of Sweeney''s time playing strategy games may pay off if this war turns against Apple and Google.Copyright  2020 Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP All Rights Reserved.
