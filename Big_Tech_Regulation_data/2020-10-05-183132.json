(Victoria Graham,Bloomberg Law[1]). These companies have exhibited a penchant for buying startup companies whose technology could potentially compete against their own or using 'platform privilege' to crush competitors who refuse to be bought. This article identifies examples of the anti-competitive behavior in question, discusses the current legislative efforts being pursued to regulate Big Tech and explores economic arguments that support stronger regulation.A recent blog post covered Facebook's decision to acquire CTRL-Labs, a startup that had developed neuro-invasive technology that allows users to control a computer with their thoughts, in the face of potential regulatory backlash from the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'). (Ryan Cole,Race to the Bottom[2]). But Facebook is not the only member of Big Tech that has been acquiring potential competition at a rapid pace. Over the last 30 years, the 5 noted above members of Big Tech have made nearly 750 acquisitions. (CB Insights[3]). Google's purchase of Waze Navigation App for $996 million in 2013 (Waze directly competes with Google's own navigation app), and Amazon's acquisition of Zappos for $1.2 billion in 2009 (Amazon and Zappos were direct competitors in the emerging online shoe sales market) both represented acquisitions directed at stifling nascent competition.Id.Big Tech's means for stifling competition are not limited to acquisitions. </p><p>These 5 companies have shown they are able to identify potential competition through reams of data, copy the startup's software/idea and then use their other platforms to crush the competing nascent tech company. (The Economist[4]). One example is the app SnapChat, which turned down a $3 billion acquisition bid by Facebook in 2013. (John Shinal,CNBC[5]). After Snap's decision to go public, Facebook replicated its central idea with Instagram Stories and essentially rendered Snap's original tech less attractive to consumers.Id. In essence, these Big Tech firms have \"platform privilege\" that allows them the ability to prioritize their own assets and crush competition, even if the competition can create a superior product. (Sally Hubbard,CNN[6]).In terms of governmental regulation, the most prominent law against anticompetitive acquisitions is Section 7 of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 (Federal Trade Commission[7]). Introduced shortly after the Supreme Court's decision to break up Standard Oil, the Clayton Act was passed due to worries that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 lacked the 'judicial teeth' necessary to prevent harm to consumers from monopolies and subdued competition. (Robert Longley,ThoughtCo.[8]) The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions where the effect of such transaction would substantially 'lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.' (15 U.S.C.  18[9]). The Department of Justice ('DOJ') has had a difficult time preventing tech acquisitions under the laws of the Clayton Act because current precedent requires harm to consumers. (Jan Wolfe,Reuters[10]). Courts usually look at whether prices are increasing or innovation is slowing as indicators of consumer harm.Id. The nature of these tech companies though is that most of their services are free (since they make the bulk of their money from advertising), which makes it difficult to prove harm to a consumer.Id.The call to reign in the market power of Big Tech from politicians is gaining steam from both sides of the aisle. Leading Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), has also expressed her dissatisfaction with the anticompetitive behaviors of Big Tech. (Matt Stevens,New York Times[11]). Her current position calls for increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquisitions and even the possibility of unwinding some previous deals that include Facebook's acquisition of Instagram or WhatsApp.Id. Republican President Donald Trump has commented also on the situation, stating that 'something is going on in terms of monopoly,' and it's 'a bad situation.' (Jake Kanter,Business Insider[12]).Besides the pressures from the executive and judicial branches, the legislative branch has also introduced a bill that will impose severe penalties on Big Tech companies that exhibit anticompetitive behavior. (Toria Rainey,BU Today[13]). The Monopolization Deterrence Act ('MDA') was introduced by Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) on July 23, 2019. (Congress[14]). The bill would give the DOJ and the FTC authority to impose civil penalties of up to 15% of an offender's total US revenue for the previous year or 30% of its revenue generated over the period in which the anticompetitive behavior occurred, whichever is greater. (Makena Kelly,The Verge[15]). Klobuchar is optimistic the MDA will give US antitrust authorities the power they need to properly regulate the anticompetitive behavior exhibited by Big Tech.Id.Recent economic studies also support the idea that Big Tech's behavior has a negative effect on the market. A study by the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business found that acquisitions of startups can be 'very damaging' to competition within the market. (Luigi Zingales et al.,Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms[16]). The paper argues that in 'a concentrated market structure, this potential competition from very small entrants may be the most important source of competition faced by the incumbent firm.'Id. An economic report from the University of Toronto entitled, 'Antitrust Limits on Startup Acquisitions' found that some limited antitrust restrictions on startup acquisitions by dominant tech firms would be socially beneficial by improving competition, maintaining stronger innovation incentives over time, and leading to greater efficiency concerning how capital is invested. (Kevin Bryan et al.,Antitrust Limits on Startup Acquisitions[17]).The extent to which the executive branch will play a role in the regulation of Big Tech's anticompetitive behavior is still uncertain. While President Trump has made public comments about the companies' monopolistic tendencies, very little action has come out of his administration. It is unlikely the current presidential administration will take any steps based on Trump's fixation with supporting capital markets and the high percentage of institutional investors who hold Big Tech stocks. It will be interesting to see if a potential changing of the guard in the 2020 Presidential and Senate elections will result in greater political pressure on Big Tech. If not, the DOJ and FTC will have their work cut out for them attempting to regulate Big Tech's acquisition of nascent startups with the current legislative landscape and judicial precedent.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh's decision in Apple v. Pepper turned on an arcane bit of antitrust law, and it provided the first small hope that the antitrust establishment may finally turn against Big Tech. But the odds remain formidable.</p><p><br/>The story begins during an almost unimaginably remote time in the American past-when the internet had not yet been invented, and antitrust law was still taken seriously. It was 1968, and the Supreme Court<url normalizedValue=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/481/\">faced a dispute</url> between Hanover Shoe, a manufacturer, and the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, from which it had leased equipment. Hanover Shoe sought damages on the grounds that United Shoe had used its monopolistic power to overcharge for the machinery.<br/>United Shoe argued that Hanover Shoe had not been injured, because it had been able to pass on the overcharge to its own customers in the form of higher shoe prices. Those customers-that is, ordinary people who buy shoes-possessed the claim against the monopolist, not the intermediary who merely passed on the monopoly price. The Court would have none of it. The ultimate buyers-who might have spent a few extra dollars for their shoes-would not be able to afford a lawsuit. The \"direct purchaser\" from the manufacturer can bring an antitrust claim even if it does not suffer any damages, the Court ruled. Otherwise, monopolists would be protected from lawsuits.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/what-2020-democratic-candidates-miss-about-antitrust/586135/?utm_source=feed\">John Newman: What Democratic contenders are missing in the race to revive antitrust</url>]<br/>However, just nine years later, the Supreme Court converted this pro-antitrust holding into an anti-antitrust rule.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/431/720.html\">Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois</url> involved similar facts. Several manufacturers who allegedly fixed prices sold their goods to an intermediary, who sold them to customers. In Hanover Shoe, the intermediary sued the manufacturer. In Illinois Brick, the customer sued the manufacturers, skipping the intermediary. The customer argued that because the monopoly overcharge was passed on to purchasers, it was entitled to damages.<br/>But this time, the Court ruled for the monopolists. It explained that since Hanover Shoe assigned the antitrust claim to the direct purchaser from the monopolist, there was nothing left to give the customers of the purchaser. If the customers were allowed to sue, liability might be duplicated. The Court dismissed the obvious counterargument-that damages should be shared between the customers and the intermediary according to the extent of harm. Economic theory tells us that the overcharge may sometimes be absorbed by the intermediary, sometimes passed on to customers, and sometimes shared, but that's hard to define in practice.<br/>Commentators pointed out that this holding made little sense. Usually the customers, not the intermediary, absorb the monopoly overcharge. The new doctrine gave the remedy to the parties least likely to be harmed and withheld it from those most likely to be harmed. And the Court turned out to have been wrong in Hanover Shoe about incentives to sue. Lawyers can organize customers to bring class-action lawsuits. Intermediaries, on the other hand, are usually terrified of monopolist suppliers, and if not, the monopolists can bribe them not to sue by giving them a share of the monopoly profits extracted from consumers.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How to fight Amazon (before you turn 29)</url>]<br/>But the Supreme Court had moved to the right by 1977, and its rightward trend would continue for years to come. The Illinois Brick rule appealed both to the neoliberalism of the time, which disapproved of antitrust liability, and to the fetish for bright-line rules found among many conservative jurists. Bright-line rules, they argued, make law more predictable by limiting the discretion of government officials, including judges-and diminishing the impact of their liberal biases.<br/>It took the tech revolution to make the flaw in this thinking so obvious, the Court could no longer ignore it.<br/>Apple argued that its App Store customers could not sue it because of Illinois Brick. How could this be? The customers handed over money to Apple in return for access to its apps; this seemed like the direct customer relationship that Illinois Brick had blessed. But Apple argued that Apple's real customers were the developers, who bought from Apple access to the App Store platform by paying a 30 percent commission based on the price of the app. The customers bought their apps from the developers, not from Apple. Since they were not \"direct purchasers\" from Apple, they could not sue Apple-only the developers could. (Of course, the developers-whose businesses are dependent on the access to consumers that the App Store provides-had not sued Apple, and have so far shown no inclination to do so.)<br/>The argument was not crazy; a similar argument was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1097030.html\">accepted</url> by a court of appeals 20 years ago. The problem here, as I argued along with other antitrust scholars in an amicus brief filed in the case, was the operation of the Illinois Brick rule, a rule already poorly suited to the brick-and-mortar world that works even less well in the virtual world. A tech giant such as Apple can easily structure its distribution chain however it wants to-just by changing some lines of code and some contractual language-to evade whatever bright-line antitrust rules the Supreme Court throws at it. It shouldn't matter to Apple whether it makes money off developers (by charging them high commissions, which they might pass on to customers) or customers (by charging them high prices, which the developers might have to offset by lowering their own prices). The labels change; the profits are the same.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/07/europe-google-antitrust-fine/565505/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Europe's smack to Google may only be the beginning</url>]<br/>Apple's App Store-unlike a factory, warehouse, or physical store-is just code that sits on servers. Apple's relationships with its customers and suppliers are also the product of code. This gives Apple degrees of freedom to structure its distribution chain in ways that monopolists of old never enjoyed.<br/>While the Court made some progress in allowing victims of monopolies to obtain a remedy, the government's decades of neglecting the antitrust violations of Big Tech leave the United States facing an enormous challenge. Indeed, not long ago many cheered tech companies for offering services for free or low prices, without realizing the strategy made sense only if the tech companies recouped their losses by obtaining monopolies.<br/>Regulators then missed the risks of allowing tech firms to consolidate by buying their rivals. And regulators missed the novel ways in which tech companies exploited their monopoly power once they achieved it-by abusing data privacy, eroding service quality, and harassing people with ads they dislike, rather than (like old-time monopolists) simply raising prices.<br/>And, of course, Big Tech, like the old-fashioned monopolists, has bought itself political goodwill. But the tech companies now seem to have overplayed their hand. With scandals mounting, and growing uneasiness about Facebook's and Google's influence on political speech-also a result of their monopoly power-a long-overdue anti-monopoly backlash has begun. If the Supreme Court seems unlikely to lead it, then the Court may, at least, not perform its usual function of standing in the way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-applevpepperisntenoughtakedownbigtech589477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W47-WWN1-JCG7-V1X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

But last year, lawmakers and federal agenciesbegan to stir, with the Federal Trade Commission requesting information from Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. The potential action against Google, in particular, has been gathering momentum for some time. Fifty state attorneys general have opened an inquiry into the company, and in January they began collaborating with the Department of Justice.</p><p>The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic raised the prospect that any antitrust action could see a further delay. But on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a lawsuit may be arriving shortly. Here are Brent Kendall and John D. McKinnon:</p><p>Both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general are likely to file antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc. s Google and are well into planning for litigation, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The Justice Department is moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, some of the people said. At least some state attorneys general led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican are likely to file a case, probably in the fall, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The story goes on to say that it s undecided whether all of this will be filed as one case or many. Among other issues, there are different theories of the case. Is the antitrust action against Google about its advertising business, or about its search business? That s the thing having a user base in the billions   there are a lot of ways you can discourage competition.</p><p> We continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General Paxton, and we don t have any updates or comments on speculation,  a Google spokeswoman told me today.</p><p>The Journal wasn t able to learn the lawyers  theory of the case. But in a new paper, a former Obama antitrust official offers one of her own. Kendall and Keach Hagey wrote about it in the Journal on Monday:</p><p> There is significant reason for concern that Google has violated U.S. antitrust law,  Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton, the chief economist in the Justice Department s antitrust division from 2011-2012, wrote in a new academic paper entitled  Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google. </p><p>The paper argues Google is using its dominance in search as a springboard to dominate the adjacent market of display advertising, harming publishers, advertisers and consumers in the $130 billion digital advertising market.</p><p>Morton s analysis is based on a December report from the United Kingdom s Competition and Markets Authority. The report  found that Google had at least 90% market share in the tools publishers use to serve ads; between 40% and 60% of the market for supply-side platforms, or SSPs, the tools publishers use to accept bids from exchanges; and between 50% and 70% of demand-side platforms, or DSPs, the tools advertisers use to bid for digital ads.  Google disputes the study s findings.</p><p>It would be nice if we could have a debate about Google and competition on the merits. But this is the United States and 2020, and so the debate is already tainted by partisan politics. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who is leading the investigation for the attorneys general, is sending fundraising emails promoting his work. Reuters reported that one email said Texans   are put at risk  by the company,  whose executives clearly display anti-conservative and anti-Republican bias, subtly controlling what Americans see when they search for information about national political issues.  </p><p>More recently, President Trump tweeted that  the Radical Left is in total command &amp; control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google,  and said his administration  is working to remedy this illegal situation.  Assuming that sort of talk continues   and it s an election year, so why wouldn t it?   the antitrust case could be recast in the public imagination as a partisan fight against content moderation. That might be good for political action committee fundraising, but it s hard to see how it will result in a more competitive economy.</p><p>In the meantime, Google is left to tiptoe around the Trump Administration and ignore its more obvious lies. It was only recently that Trump took to his podium to announce that Google had a thousand engineers building a website for Americans to find nearby COVID-19 tests. (It did not, though Alphabet subsidiary Verily did launch a more limited site. The site didn t work all that well.) Then Trump apparently lied again and said Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to apologize for the confusion.</p><p>My colleagues Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn asked Pichai about that apology in an interview published today:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nilay Patel: You had to know this question was coming. I keep track every week of when Trump and his team held up the flowchart and said,  Some x thousand Google engineers are working on it. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just walk me through that day. Did you expect that to come? The next day, Trump said someone from Google had called and apologized to him. Did that happen? Just what was that set of days like?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pichai:</emphasis>Very early on through COVID, we decided as a company we should do everything [in] areas where our expertise could help. And so we had a wide set of efforts.</p><p>I think there were two efforts, and we were in touch with the [White House] coronavirus task force. And there were two efforts, both in terms of what Google can do to provide more information, and Verily was working on a way to develop wide-scale testing, particularly with an emphasis on drive-through testing, with a focus on first responders. And we were in touch on both efforts. And so that s what it was.</p><p>That seems like a very diplomatic way of saying that no, he did not apologize.</p><p>In a world with less going on, we might be having a conversation about why the same government considering a breakup of a tech giant was relying on that same tech giant s size and power to provide critical aid during a pandemic. Or why the government was relying on tech giants for so much of its pandemic response at all. Or even what ever happened to Trump s 2019 pledge to investigate Google for  treason  (?!).</p><p>Instead it all just bleeds together into partisan noise. And if and when the antitrust case against Google lands, it s hard to imagine that won t just become part of the noise, too.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up</emphasis>:<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>Care, a pilot program that gives corporate employees access to virtual medical services, is expanding to warehouse works in the Seattle area.

They have had a top-10 performing post on Facebook regularly for months. A video they recently posted called  The Liar Tweets Tonight,  sung by a choir of individually recorded voters to the tune of  The Lion Sleeps Tonight,  was viewed 41 million times, among the most-watched videos on Facebook over the last month.</p><p> Democratic voters are tired of the Democratic Party kind of taking barrages from Republicans on the right on social media and Trump himself, taking that lying down and not fighting back,  Omar Rivero said.

It is also widely reported[2] that the Department of Justice is preparing a lawsuit against Google that will likely include allegations of anticompetitive behavior in this market, and is likely to be joined by a number of state attorneys general in that lawsuit. Meanwhile, several papers[3] have been published detailing[4] these allegations[5].This aspect of digital advertising can be incredibly complex and difficult to understand. Here we explain how display advertising fits in the broader digital advertising market, describe how display advertising works, consider the main allegations against Google, and explain why Google's critics are misguided to focus on antitrust as a solution to alleged problems in the market (even if those allegations turn out to be correct). Display advertising in context<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertising\">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertising</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertisingOver\">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/6/14/75-years-of-us-advertisingOver</url> the past decade, the price of advertising has fallen steadily while output has risen. </p><p>Spending on digital advertising in the US grew from $26 billion in 2010[6] to nearly $130 billion in 2019, an average increase of 20% a year. Over the same period the Producer Price Index for Internet advertising sales declined by nearly 40%.[7] The rising spending in the face of falling prices indicates the number of ads bought and sold increased by approximately 27% a year. Since 2000, advertising spending has been falling as a share of GDP[8], with online advertising growing as a share of that. The combination of increasing quantity, decreasing cost, and increasing total revenues are consistent with a growing and increasingly competitive market.Display advertising on third-party websites is only a small subsection of the digital advertising market, comprising approximately 15-20% of digital advertising spending in the US. The rest of the digital advertising market is made up of ads on search results pages on sites like Google, Amazon and Kayak, on people's Instagram and Facebook feeds, listings on sites like Zillow (for houses) or Craigslist, referral fees paid to price comparison websites for things like health insurance, audio and visual ads on services like Spotify and Hulu, and sponsored content from influencers and bloggers who will promote products to their fans.<url normalizedValue=\"https://plumconsulting.co.uk/online-advertising-in-the-uk/https://plumconsulting.co.uk/online-advertising-in-the-uk/And\">https://plumconsulting.co.uk/online-advertising-in-the-uk/https://plumconsulting.co.uk/online-advertising-in-the-uk/And</url> digital advertising itself is only one of many channels through which companies can market their products. About 53% of total advertising spending in the United States[9] goes on digital channels, with 30% going on TV advertising and the rest on things like radio ads, billboards and other more traditional forms of advertising. A few people still even read physical newspapers and the ads they contain, although physical newspapers' bigger money makers have traditionally been classified ads[10], which have been replaced by less costly and more effective internet classifieds, such as those offered by Craigslist, or targeted ads on Google Maps or Facebook.Indeed, it should be noted that advertising itself is only part of the larger marketing market of which non-advertising marketing communication\u2014e.g., events, sales promotion, direct marketing, telemarketing, product placement\u2014is as big a part as is advertising (each is roughly $500bn globally[11]); it just hasn't been as thoroughly disrupted by the Internet yet. But it is a mistake to assume that digital advertising is not a part of this broader market. And of that $1tr global market, Internet advertising in total occupies only about 18%\u2014and thus display advertising only about 3%.Ad placement is only one part of the cost of digital advertising. An advertiser trying to persuade people to buy its product must also do market research and analytics to find out who its target market is and what they want. Moreover, there are the costs of designing and managing a marketing campaign and additional costs to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/Nevertheless\">https://www.seriouseats.com/Nevertheless</url>, one of the most straightforward ways to earn money from a website is to show ads to readers alongside the publisher's content. To satisfy publishers' demand for advertising revenues, many services have arisen to automate and simplify the placement of and payment for ad space on publishers' websites. Google plays a large role in providing these services\u2014what is referred to as 'open display' advertising. And it is Google's substantial role in this space that has sparked speculation and concern among antitrust watchdogs and enforcement authorities.Before delving into the open display advertising market, a quick note about terms. In these discussions, 'advertisers' are businesses that are trying to sell people stuff. Advertisers include large firms such as Best Buy and Disney and small businesses like the local plumber or financial adviser. 'Publishers' are websites that carry those ads, and publish content that users want to read. Note that the term 'publisher' refers to all websites regardless of the things they're carrying: a blog about the best way to clean stains out of household appliances is a 'publisher' just as much as the New York Times is.Under this broad definition, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are also considered publishers. In their role as publishers, they have a common goal: to provide content that attracts users to their pages who will act on the advertising displayed. 'Users' are you and me\u2014the people who want to read publishers' content, and to whom advertisers want to show ads. Finally, 'intermediaries' are the digital businesses, like Google, that sit in between the advertisers and the publishers, allowing them to do business with each other without ever meeting or speaking. The display advertising market If you're an advertiser, display advertising works like this: your company\u2014one that sells shoes, let's say\u2014wants to reach a certain kind of person and tell her about the company's shoes. These shoes are comfortable, stylish, and inexpensive. You use a tool like Google Ads (or, if it's a big company and you want a more expansive campaign over which you have more control, Google Marketing Platform) to design and upload an ad, and tell Google about the people you want to read\u2014their age and location, say, and/or characterizations of their past browsing and searching habits ('interested in sports').Using that information, Google finds ad space on websites whose audiences match the people you want to target. This ad space is auctioned off to the highest bidder among the range of companies vying, with your shoe company, to reach users matching the characteristics of the website's users. Thanks to tracking data, it doesn't just have to be sports-relevant websites: as a user browses sports-related sites on the web, her browser picks up files (cookies) that will tag her as someone potentially interested in sports apparel for targeting later.So a user might look at a sports website and then later go to a recipe blog, and there receive the shoes ad on the basis of her earlier browsing. You, the shoe seller, hope that she will either click through and buy (or at least consider buying) the shoes when she sees those ads, but one of the benefits of display advertising over search advertising is that\u2014as with TV ads or billboard ads\u2014just seeing the ad will make her aware of the product and potentially more likely to buy it later. Advertisers thus sometimes pay on the basis of clicks, sometimes on the basis of views, and sometimes on the basis of conversion (when a consumer takes an action of some sort, such as making a purchase or filling out a form).That's the advertiser's perspective. From the publisher's perspective\u2014the owner of that recipe blog, let's say\u2014you want to auction ad space off to advertisers like that shoe company. In that case, you go to an ad server\u2014Google's product is called AdSense\u2014give them a little bit of information about your site, and add some html code to your website. These ad servers gather information about your content (e.g., by looking at keywords you use) and your readers (e.g., by looking at what websites they've used in the past to make guesses about what they'll be interested in) and places relevant ads next to and among your content. If they click, lucky you\u2014you'll get paid a few cents or dollars. <url normalizedValue=\"https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/\">https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/Apart\">https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/Apart</url> from privacy concerns about the tracking of users, the really tricky and controversial part here concerns the way scarce advertising space is allocated. Most of the time, it's done through auctions that happen in real time: each time a user loads a website, an auction is held in a fraction of a second to decide which advertiser gets to display an ad. The longer this process takes, the slower pages load and the more likely users are to get frustrated and go somewhere else.As well as the service hosting the auction, there are lots of little functions that different companies perform that make the auction and placement process smoother. Some fear that by offering a very popular product integrated end to end, Google's 'stack' of advertising products can bias auctions in favour of its own products. There's also speculation that Google's product is so tightly integrated and so effective at using data to match users and advertisers that it is not viable for smaller rivals to compete.We'll discuss this speculation and fear in more detail below. But it's worth bearing in mind that this kind of real-time bidding for ad placement was not always the norm, and is not the only way that websites display ads to their users even today. Big advertisers and websites often deal with each other directly. As with, say, TV advertising, large companies advertising often have a good idea about the people they want to reach. And big publishers (like popular news websites) often have a good idea about who their readers are. For example, big brands often want to push a message to a large number of people across different customer types as part of a broader ad campaign.Of these kinds of direct sales, sometimes the space is bought outright, in advance, and reserved for those advertisers. In most cases, direct sales are run through limited, intermediated auction services that are not open to the general market. Put together, these kinds of direct ad buys account for close to 70%[12] of total US display advertising spending. The remainder\u2014the stuff that's left over after these kinds of sales have been done\u2014is typically sold through the real-time, open display auctions described above. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/private-marketplace-ad-spending-to-surpass-open-exchange-in-2020\">https://www.emarketer.com/content/private-marketplace-ad-spending-to-surpass-open-exchange-in-2020</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/private-marketplace-ad-spending-to-surpass-open-exchange-in-2020Different\">https://www.emarketer.com/content/private-marketplace-ad-spending-to-surpass-open-exchange-in-2020Different</url> adtech products compete on their ability to target customers effectively, to serve ads quickly (since any delay in the auction and ad placement process slows down page load times for users), and to do so inexpensively. All else equal (including the effectiveness of the ad placement), advertisers want to pay the lowest possible price to place an ad. Similarly, publishers want to receive the highest possible price to display an ad. As a result, both advertisers and publishers have a keen interest in reducing the intermediary's 'take' of the ad spending.This is all a simplification of how the market works. There is not one single auction house for ad space\u2014in practice, many advertisers and publishers end up having to use lots of different auctions to find the best price. As the market evolved to reach this state from the early days of direct ad buys, new functions that added efficiency to the market emerged.In the early years of ad display auctions, individual processes in the stack were performed by numerous competing companies. Through a process of 'vertical integration' some companies, such as Google, brought these different processes under the same roof, with the expectation that integration would streamline the stack and make the selling and placement of ads more efficient and effective. The process of vertical integration in pursuit of efficiency has led to a more consolidated market in which Google is the largest player, offering simple, integrated ad buying products to advertisers and ad selling products to publishers.Google is by no means the only integrated adtech service provider, however: Facebook, Amazon, Verizon, AT&amp;#38;T/Xandr, theTradeDesk, LumenAd, Taboola and others also provide end-to-end adtech services. But, in the market for open auction placement on third-party websites, Google is the biggest. The cases against Google The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) carried out a formal study into the digital advertising market[13] between 2019 and 2020, issuing its final report in July of this year. Although also encompassing Google's Search advertising business and Facebook's display advertising business (both of which relate to ads on those companies 'owned and operated' websites and apps), the CMA study involved the most detailed independent review of Google's open display advertising business to date.That study did not lead to any competition enforcement proceedings against Google\u2014the CMA concluded, in other words, that Google had not broken UK competition law\u2014but it did conclude that Google's vertically integrated products led to conflicts of interest that could lead it to behaving in ways that did not benefit the advertisers and publishers that use it. One example was Google's withholding of certain data from publishers that would make it easier for them to use other ad selling products; another was the practice of setting price floors that allegedly led advertisers to pay more than they would otherwise.Instead the CMA recommended the setting up of a 'Digital Marketing Unit' (DMU) that could regulate digital markets in general, and a code of conduct for Google and Facebook (and perhaps other large tech platforms) intended to govern their dealings with smaller customers.The CMA's analysis is flawed[14], however. For instance, it makes big assumptions about the dependency of advertisers on display advertising, largely assuming that they would not switch to other forms of advertising if prices rose, and it is light on economics. But factually it is the most comprehensively researched investigation into digital advertising yet published.Piggybacking on the CMA's research, and mounting perhaps the strongest attack on Google's adtech offerings to date, was a paper released just prior to the CMA's final report called 'Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google[15]', by Yale economist Fiona Scott Morton and Omidyar Network lawyer David Dinielli. Dinielli will testify[16] before the Senate committee.While the Scott Morton and Dinielli paper is extremely broad, it also suffers from a number of problems.One, because it was released before the CMA's final report, it is largely based on the interim report[17] released months earlier by the CMA, halfway through the market study in December 2019. This means that several of its claims are out of date. For example, it makes much of the possibility raised by the CMA in its interim report that Google may take a larger cut of advertising spending than its competitors, and claims made in another report that Google introduces 'hidden' fees that increases the overall cut it takes from ad auctions.But in the final report, after further investigation, the CMA concludes that this is not the case. In the final report[18], the CMA describes its analysis of all Google Ad Manager open auctions related to UK web traffic during the period between 8-14 March 2020 (involving billions of auctions). This, according to the CMA, allowed it to observe any possible 'hidden' fees as well. The CMA concludes:Our analysis found that, in transactions where both Google Ads and Ad Manager (AdX) are used, Google's overall take rate is approximately 30% of advertisers' spend. This is broadly in line with (or slightly lower than) our aggregate market-wide fee estimate outlined above. We also calculated the margin between the winning bid and the second highest bid in AdX for Google and non-Google DSPs, to test whether Google was systematically able to win with a lower margin over the second highest bid (which might have indicated that they were able to use their data advantage to extract additional hidden fees). We found that Google's average winning margin was similar to that of non-Google DSPs. Overall, this evidence does not indicate that Google is currently extracting significant hidden fees. As noted below, however, it retains the ability and incentive to do so. (p. 275, emphasis added)Scott Morton and Dinielli also misquote and/or misunderstand important sections of the CMA interim report as relating to display advertising when, in fact, they relate to search. For example, Scott Morton and Dinielli write that the 'CMA concluded that Google has nearly insurmountable advantages in access to location data, due to the location information [uniquely available to it from other sources].' (p. 15). The CMA never makes any claim of 'insurmountable advantage,' however. Rather, to support the claim, Scott Morton and Dinielli cite to a portion of the CMA interim report recounting a suggestion made by Microsoft regarding the 'critical' value of location data in providing relevant advertising.But that portion of the report, as well as the suggestion made by Microsoft, is about search advertising. While location data may also be valuable for display advertising, it is not clear that the GPS-level data that is so valuable in providing mobile search ad listings (for a nearby cafe or restaurant, say) is particularly useful for display advertising, which may be just as well-targeted by less granular, city- or county-level location data, which is readily available from a number of sources. In any case, Scott Morton and Dinielli are simply wrong to use a suggestion offered by Microsoft relating to search advertising to demonstrate the veracity of an assertion about a conclusion drawn by the CMA regarding display advertising.Scott Morton and Dinielli also confusingly word their own judgements about Google's conduct in ways that could be misinterpreted as conclusions by the CMA:The CMA reports that Google has implemented an anticompetitive sales strategy on the publisher ad server end of the intermediation chain. Specifically, after purchasing DoubleClick, which became its publisher ad server, Google apparently lowered its prices to publishers by a factor of ten, at least according to one publisher's account related to the CMA. (p. 20)In fact, the CMA does not conclude that Google lowering its prices was an 'anticompetitive sales strategy'\u2014it does not use these words at all\u2014and what Scott Morton and Dinielli are referring to is a claim by a rival ad server business, Smart, that Google cutting its prices after acquiring Doubleclick led to Google expanding its market share. Apart from the misleading wording, it is unclear why a competition authority should consider it to be 'anticompetitive' when prices are falling and kept low, and\u2014as Smart reported to the CMA\u2014its competitor's response is to enhance its own offering. The case that remains Stripping away the elements of Scott Morton and Dinielli's case that seem unsubstantiated by a more careful reading of the CMA reports, and with the benefit of the findings in the CMA's final report, we are left with a case that argues that Google self-preferences to an unreasonable extent, giving itself a product that is as successful as it is in display advertising only because of Google's unique ability to gain advantage from its other products that have little to do with display advertising. Because of this self-preferencing, they might argue, innovative new entrants cannot compete on an equal footing, so the market loses out on incremental competition because of the advantages Google gets from being the world's biggest search company, owning YouTube, running Google Maps and Google Cloud, and so on.The most significant examples of this are Google's use of data from other products\u2014like location data from Maps or viewing history from YouTube\u2014to target ads more effectively; its ability to enable advertisers placing search ads to easily place display ads through the same interface; its introduction of faster and more efficient auction processes that sidestep the existing tools developed by other third-party ad exchanges; and its design of its own tool ('open bidding') for aggregating auction bids for advertising space to compete with (rather than incorporate) an alternative tool ('header bidding') that is arguably faster, but costs more money to use.These allegations require detailed consideration, and in a future paper we will attempt to assess them in detail. But in thinking about them now it may be useful to consider the remedies that could be imposed to address them, assuming they do diminish the ability of rivals to compete with Google: what possible interventions we could make in order to make the market work better for advertisers, publishers, and users.We can think of remedies as falling into two broad buckets: remedies that stop Google from doing things that improve the quality of its own offerings, thus making it harder for others to keep up; and remedies that require it to help rivals improve their products in ways otherwise accessible only to Google (e.g., by making Google's products interoperable with third-party services) without inherently diminishing the quality of Google's own products.The first camp of these, what we might call 'status quo minus,' includes rules banning Google from using data from its other products or offering single order forms for advertisers, or, in the extreme, a structural remedy that 'breaks up' Google by either forcing it to sell off its display ad business altogether or to sell off elements of it.What is striking about these kinds of interventions is that all of them 'work' by making Google worse for those that use it. Restrictions on Google's ability to use data from other products, for example, will make its service more expensive and less effective for those who use it. Ads will be less well-targeted and therefore less effective. This will lead to lower bids from advertisers. Lower ad prices will be transmitted through the auction process to produce lower payments for publishers. Reduced publisher revenues will mean some content providers exit. Users will thus be confronted with less available content and ads that are less relevant to them and thus, presumably, more annoying. In other words: No one will be better off, and most likely everyone will be worse off.The reason a 'single order form' helps Google is that it is useful to advertisers, the same way it's useful to be able to buy all your groceries at one store instead of lots of different ones. Similarly, vertical integration in the 'ad stack' allows for a faster, cheaper, and simpler product for users on all sides of the market. A different kind of integration that has been criticized by others, where third-party intermediaries can bid more quickly if they host on Google Cloud, benefits publishers and users because it speeds up auction time, allowing websites to load faster. So does Google's unified alternative to 'header bidding,' giving a speed boost that is apparently valuable enough to publishers that they will pay for it.So who would benefit from stopping Google from doing these things, or even forcing Google to sell its operations in this area? Not advertisers or publishers. Maybe Google's rival ad intermediaries would; presumably, artificially hamstringing Google's products would make it easier for them to compete with Google. But if so, it's difficult to see how this would be an overall improvement. It is even harder to see how this would improve the competitive process\u2014the very goal of antitrust. Rather, any increase in the competitiveness of rivals would result not from making their products better, but from making Google's product worse. That is a weakening of competition, not its promotion.On the other hand, interventions that aim to make Google's products more interoperable at least do not fall prey to this problem. Such 'status quo plus' interventions would aim to take the benefits of Google's products and innovations and allow more companies to use them to improve their own competing products. Not surprisingly, such interventions would be more in line with the conclusions the CMA came to than the divestitures and operating restrictions proposed by Scott Morton and Dinielli, as well as (reportedly) state attorneys general considering a case against Google[19].But mandated interoperability raises a host of different concerns: extensive and uncertain rulemaking, ongoing regulatory oversight, and, likely, price controls, all of which would limit Google's ability to experiment with and improve its products. The history of such mandated duties to deal or compulsory licenses is a troubled one, at best. But even if, for the sake of argument, we concluded that these kinds of remedies were desirable, they are difficult to impose via an antitrust lawsuit of the kind that the Department of Justice is expected to launch. Most importantly, if the conclusion of Google's critics is that Google's main offense is offering a product that is just too good to compete with without regulating it like a utility, with all the costs to innovation that that would entail, maybe we ought to think twice about whether an antitrust intervention is really worth it at all. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20ExplainedThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;linkname=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20Explainedhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F09%2F14%2Fthe-antitrust-case-against-googles-adtech-business-explained%2F&amp;#38;title=The%20Antitrust%20Case%20Against%20Google%E2%80%99s%20Adtech%20Business%2C%20ExplainedThe</url> post The Antitrust Case Against Google's Adtech Business, Explained[20] appeared first on Truth on the Market[21].

The companies said they weren't aware of any investigation and the Justice Department declined to comment.</p><p>The investigations mark an about-face from the Bush administration's more laissez-faire approach to antitrust.</p><p>In May, Christine Varney, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's antitrust division, laid out the <person><nameText>Obama administration's </nameText></person>policy, saying the government agency would be \"aggressively pursuing\" monopoly and antitrust cases against dominant companies to \"ensure the American consumer's access to the best products at the lowest prices.\"</p><p>What it all means for you. Some experts say targeting dominant companies engaged in anti-competitive practices helps consumers, since increased competition usually results in lower prices.</p><p>\"Antitrust is just a fancy word for consumer protection,\" said Richard Brosnick an antitrust attorney at Butzel Long. \"These investigations are intended to be pro-consumer by preventing exclusive deals that heighten prices or reduce selection.\"</p><p>But others say clamping down on antitrust -- especially in a recession -- will only hurt consumers. They argue that targeting big companies will hamper innovation and limit choice for consumers.</p><p>\"I don't think there's ever a time to go after successful businesses that are helping the public,\" said James Gattuso, senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. \"The best system is where consumers decide for themselves. But by cracking down on ill-advised antitrust laws, you are telling companies, 'Don't make investments, don't try to be successful and help consumers.' \"</p><p>Gattuso also believes that the <person><nameText>Obama administration's </nameText></person>antitrust policies could slow an economic rebound.</p><p>\"There's a very strong chance it could hurt the economic recovery, which won't come from Washington by spending money out of Congress, but by people putting their own savings into new ideas that they hope will be successful,\" he said.</p><p>Drilling into telecom. If the telecom investigation is indeed taking place, experts say the government may investigate exclusivity deals like the one Apple has with AT&amp;T for the iPhone.</p><p>Through that deal, iPhone consumers' choice in wireless provider is limited to AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T can set its service costs without a worry that competitors will undercut them. RIM's BlackBerry smartphone, on the other hand, is available on all carriers, and has benefited from providers' promotions, including Verizon's buy-one-BlackBerry-get-one-free deal.</p><p>\"Exclusivity deals like Apple and AT&amp;T led some consumers to hack into their iPhones,\" said Brosnick. \"There will be a lot more scrutiny going forward when it comes to those kinds of deals.\"</p><p>Some believe that just the threat of an investigation into the telecom industry will help lower prices and provide consumers with more control over their phone plans.</p><p>\"The U.S. and Canadian markets in particular have very limited price-based competition among carriers,\" said Andy Castonguay director of mobile and access devices research at Yankee Group. \"Before the government gets involved in any antitrust issues, operators will have to take very tactical and practical measures to avoid governmental intervention.\"</p><p>Castonguay said government pressure could lead companies to change their payment structures so that overage charges would be a thing of the past. For example, a customer with a 450-minute plan that uses 650 minutes could be automatically bumped up to a 700-minute plan, which costs, say, $10 more per month, rather than 45 cents per extra minute charge, which would cost $90.</p><p>He also said the telecom industry could be forced to make it easier to switch phones to rivals' networks or alert users before they are charged for going over their minutes.</p><p>\"There are a number of things that are bizarre about mobile industry,\" said Castonguay. \"To the extent that they can implement these tactics, they would come across as much more fair and reasonable.\"</p><p>Still, others argue if the telecom and wireless industry is indeed in need of a crackdown, it should come from consumers.</p><p>\"In the wireless industry, there is more choice than in most industries,\" said Gattuso. \"Consumers have been able to choose what they want and benefit from that choice. Antitrust should be confined to where that choice doesn't exist.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20090707antitrust_consumers1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W3S-3R40-Y927-F016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>5:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 7, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000AI6X</classCode><className>BUTZEL LONG PC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The agencies have also signalled an increased scepticism of behavioural remedies.Two key court decisions will also influence merger review going forward. The DOJ's loss in its effort to block the AT...ime Warner merger and pending appeal will likely impact not only 'vertical' mergers but also horizontal tech mergers given the court's focus on the dynamic competitive landscape. And the Supreme Court's decision in Ohio v American Express,1 while not a merger case, warrants attention given that its teaching regarding two-sided markets may well impact merger analysis.In the current enforcement environment, understanding the unique issues that drive enforcement in the technology arena - from the importance of intellectual property and innovation com- petition, to network effects and Food and Drug Administration regulations - is critical to achieving merger clearance in close cases.'Our mantra is vigorous enforcement': DOJ and FTC management heed calls for enforcement in high-tech and pharmaNew leadership is now at the helm of both the DOJ and FTC, with Makan Delrahim confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017 and Joe Simons confirmed as chairman of the FTC in April 2018. Delrahim's deputies are also all in place and Trump has now filled all vacancies on the FTC, so both agencies are at full strength.2During Delrahim's and Simons's confirmation hearings, law- makers questioned their intention to enforce the antitrust laws to combat perceived increasing concentration, both generally, and in high-tech and pharma specifically. </p><p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, asked Simons about the growing market power of large tech companies during his confirmation hearing.3The FTC and DOJ appear to be responding to the calls for vigorous enforcement. In April 2018, Delrahim gave a speech focused on antitrust enforcement in the digital era addressing concerns that: Antitrust laws are ill-equipped to address competition issues that have arisen in the digital platform economy, and that as a result of the antitrust laws' supposed lack of adaptability more generally, there have been harmful increases in industry concentration, along with a variety of other social ills.4 He argued that, to the contrary, the antitrust laws are well-equipped to deal with 'evolving business models' and said that the government stands ready to use those tools.5 Delrahim pledged enforcement: If there is clear evidence of harm to competition in digital platforms, enforcers must take vigorous action and seek remedies that protect American consumers, so that free markets or consumers don't instead bear the risk of failure.6 Likewise, Simons promised during his confirmation hearing that he would investigate whether merger enforcement is 'too lax'.7 In June 2018, he announced that the FTC will hold public hearings begin- ning in September 2018 and continuing into 2019, covering topics ranging from 'communication, information and media technology networks' and 'markets featuring \"platform\" businesses', to '[t]he intersection between privacy, big data, and competition' and 'evalu- ating the competitive effects of corporate acquisitions and mergers'. The hearings are also expected to address 'the role of intellectual property and competition policy in promoting innovation', a topic of great importance to tech and pharma industries.8 In a meeting with the press announcing the hearings, Simons said that the FTC's 'mantra is vigorous enforcement'.9Pharmaceuticals and medical devices remain key focus for enforcersThe FTC's pro-enforcement cadence is particularly pronounced in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.Since being elected, Trump has been outspoken, complaining about drug prices.10 Trump's FTC appointees have also voiced concern about drug prices. Simons, for instance, stated during his confirmation hearing that he is 'very concerned' about price increases for prescription drugs and said he would look into creat- ing a task force to assess whether anticompetitive conduct is lead- ing to higher prices. Simons said pharmaceutical companies should anticipate that the FTC will continue to bring enforcement actions where it believes a transaction is anticompetitive, especially if there is concern about resulting high drug prices.11Recent enforcement actions have targeted mergers involving medical devices, which seem to attract less rhetoric, but just as much enforcement as pharmaceutical mergers.In November 2017, the FTC entered a consent order with Abbott Laboratories and Alere settling charges that Abbott's US$8.3 billion acquisition of Alere would result in a firm with a combined share of 97 per cent in point-of-care blood gas testing systems and a 100 per cent share in point-of-care cardiac marker testing systems.12 The consent order required the parties to divest Alere's blood gas testing and cardiac marker testing systems, including intellectual property, technology, and manufacturing facilities.13In December 2017, the FTC entered a final order requiring Integra LifeSciences to divest five medical device product lines to complete its US$1 billion acquisition of Johnson #38; Johnson's Codman Neuro division, alleging the transaction, as proposed, would harm competition in multiple markets, including dural grafts and intracranial pressure monitoring systems.14 In each of the five markets, the FTC alleged that Integra and Codman were 'the only', 'two of only three', or '[with Medtronic] the only three' significant suppliers in the United States.15 The FTC consent order required Integra to divest related product lines and a manufactur- ing facility and to supply the buyer with cranial access kits until the buyer is able to secure a different supply source.16Agencies continue to challenge non-reportable high- tech, pharmaceutical and medical device dealsDeals that do not have to be reported to the DOJ and FTC under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act - because they fall below the HSR 'size of person' and 'size of transaction' thresholds - continue to be a focus of the agencies, including in the tech and pharmaceutical and medical device industries.In December 2017, for instance, the FTC filed an administrative complaint to challenge Otto Bock's acquisition of FIH Group, a transaction that closed in September 2017.17 The FTC alleged that Otto Bock is 'the leading manufacturer and supplier of microprocessor prosthetic knees' and through this transaction acquired 'its closest [and] most significant and disruptive competitor' in the market for microprocessor prosthetic knees. The FTC alleged that Otto Bock thereby eliminated 'direct and substantial competition' between the companies, 'further entrenching Otto Bock as the dominant supplier'.18The FTC alleged that competition between Otto Bock and FIH promoted innovation and asked the administrative law judge to 'unscramble the eggs' to 'restore two or more distinct and separate, viable and independent businesses'.19 In June 2018, the judge certified the matter to the FTC for consideration of a proposed consent proposal, finding there was a reasonable possibility of settlement, even though complaint counsel did not agree to the proposed settlement.20In December 2017, the DOJ filed a complaint challenging the February 2017 acquisition by TransDigm Group of Schroth Safety Products and Schroth Protection Systems, and simultaneously filed a proposed consent order.21 According to the DOJ, the acquisition combined the 'world's dominant supplier of restraint systems used on commercial airplanes' and its 'closest and only meaningful competitor' in restraint systems, which had 'embarked on an ambi- tious plan to capture market share . . . by competing . . . on price and heavily investing in research and development of new restraint technologies', resulting in lower prices for customers.22 TransDigm agreed to divest the entire business acquired.23What remedies will US antitrust enforcers accept? Trump officials sceptical of behavioural remedies, even to resolve concerns raised by vertical mergersThe DOJ and FTC have long preferred 'structural' remedies - dives- titure of an ongoing business - while sometimes accepting dives- titure of specific assets, to enable a firm to compete and preserve competition lost by proposed mergers and acquisitions involving horizontal competitors.On the other hand, both the DOJ and FTC have historically accepted 'behavioural' remedies to resolve antitrust concerns raised by proposed vertical mergers and acquisitions, such as a prohibition on discrimination, while allowing the parties to complete the merger to obtain efficiencies from vertical integration.That position was memorialised in the DOJ's 2011 Antitrust Division Policy Guide to Merger Remedies, which advised that when addressing a horizontal merger, 'the Division will pursue a divestiture remedy in the vast majority of cases', but in addressing a vertical merger, 'the Division will consider tailored conduct remedies designed to prevent conduct that might harm consumers while still allowing the efficiencies that may come from the merger to be realised'.24Soon after his confirmation, Delrahim announced that the DOJ under his watch would 'return to the preferred focus on structural relief to remedy mergers that violate the law'.25 He argued that behavioural remedies adopted to resolve competitive concerns raised by vertical mergers in recent years, including in the 2010 Ticketmaster/Live Nation and 2011 Comcast/NBC Universal mergers, 'supplant competition with regulation'.26 Antitrust law, Delrahim argued, should be 'law enforcement, not regulation'.27 Other DOJ officials, including DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General Barry Nigro, have argued that '[t]he imposition of a behavioural remedy inverts the Division's role into something it is not - the hall monitor for private businesses operating in a free market economy'.28 Nigro also stated that the DOJ's obligation to 'accept only a complete and effective solution to anticompetitive transactions' means that the DOJ 'favours structural fixes that promote and protect competition rather than substitute competition with regulation'.29Joe Simons' FTC is largely following suit, though it has left the door open to occasionally accepting behavioural relief. When asked to name the top three challenges facing the FTC, Joe Simons stated that the '30 per cent failure rate [for remedies] is too high and needs to be lowered substantially'.30 In June 2018, Simons said '[t]he best approach is a non-behavioural remedy' though he said the FTC will accept behavioural remedies in 'rare, very limited' circumstances.31 This policy shift is already having ramifications for merger challenges. The DOJ refused to accept proffered behavioural rem- edies in reviewing AT... proposed acquisition of Time Warner and instead sought a preliminary injunction to block the merger. The same district court judge that found the DOJ's consent agree- ment, resolving concerns raised by Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal to be 'in the public interest', denied the DOJ's effort to block AT... acquisition of Time Warner, discussed further below. The FTC meanwhile appears to be changing its approach to remedies to resolve potential competition concerns in the pharma- ceutical industry. The director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition said during a speech in February 2018 that the FTC will be more sceptical of divestitures of pipeline assets: [P]arties should expect that in transactions where complex pharmaceutical products . . . need to be divested, we will require the divestiture of contract manufacturing capabilities rather than other assets, such as pipeline products. Based on a history of problems with divestitures in this area, our view is that divesting ongoing manufacturing rather than products that haven't yet come to market places the greater risk of failure on the merging firms, rather than the American public.32 High-profile DOJ losses may impact market definition in high-tech platformsThe DOJ suffered two high-profile losses in June 2018, which may influence market definition in high-tech mergers.After a year long investigation and six-week trial, the DC District Court refused to enjoin the merger of AT...nd Time Warner.33 The DOJ alleged that the combination of Time Warner's media content with AT... video distribution network would allow the combined firm to 'use its control over Time Warner's valuable and highly popular networks to hinder its rivals by forcing them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for the right to distribute those networks'.34In its 172-page decision, now on appeal, the DC District Court accepted 'that vertical mergers \"are not invariably innocuous\",' but found that the DOJ failed to 'meet its burden to establish that the proposed \"transaction is likely to lessen competition substantially\".'35 Of particular interest, the court 'factor[ed] in the dramatic changes that are transforming how consumers view video content' in his decision.36 This acknowledgement of the importance of for- ward-looking analysis should lend credibility to arguments about changing industry dynamics in future mergers involving high-tech firms, in horizontal as well as vertical mergers.The AT...ecision was followed two weeks later by the Supreme Court's decision in Ohio v American Express.37 There, the Supreme Court held that the DOJ and state attorneys general did not prove that American Express's non-discrimination rules, prohibiting merchants from steering customers to Visa and MasterCard, were anticompetitive.38The Supreme Court in Amex reasoned that the effect of conduct on both sides of a 'two-sided' market must be considered before concluding conduct is anticompetitive: Focusing on merchant fees alone misses the mark because the product that credit-card companies sell is transactions, not services to merchants, and the competitive effects of a restraint on transactions cannot be judged by looking at merchants alone. Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot by itself demonstrate an anticompetitive exercise of market power.39 While the Amex decision leaves many questions unanswered, it opens the door to arguments to win approval for high tech mergers in multi-sided markets.40 In particular, the Supreme Court's recognition that the 'commercial realities' of credit card transactions required looking to both sides of a market provides strong support for the concept that all incentives on parties' pricing and output decisions must be taken into account in both defining a market, and assessing the harm in that market. 41Footnotes1 Ohio v American Express Co, No. 16-1454 (25 June 2018).2 Delrahim and Simons each bring years of antitrust experience and served in senior antitrust enforcement positions in the George W Bush Administration - Delrahim as Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the DOJ and Simons as Director of the Bureau of Competition at the FTC. Both appointees emphasise the importance of taking an economic focused approach to analysing antitrust issues.3 Fed. Trade Comm'n Nomination Hearing Before the S.

One after the other, men in shirtsleeves pulled up in Chevy Suburbans and GMC Yukon XLs and gleaming Lexus RS 300s with leather-trimmed seats, got out, then made their way across the marble lobby and up a flight of stairs. A brightly smiling woman approached them as they congregated around a registration desk. \"How are you?\" she asked each one. \"What's your first name?\" She jotted the letters onto a yellow sticky note and worked her way down the line. \"Do you have an appointment? Awesome!\"</p><p>The men were black-car drivers, currently working for the ride-summoning companies Uber or Lyft, or both, and they were there, in all likelihood, because another driver had told them that they could get more money, and better treatment, if they signed up to drive for a new rival, Juno. New York City-which has no shortage of ways to get around, from pedicabs to one of the largest public-transportation systems in the world-is just one stage upon which a handful of companies are fighting to dominate the future of personal transportation. Juno has decided that the most effective way to do that is by being extra-nice to the drivers.</p><p>After the men registered, they were ushered into a waiting room, where draped caf\u00e9 tables had been set up with brochures: \"How to Be a 5 Star Juno Driver.\" Club music was playing. A handful of young Juno employees glided around, speaking in soothing tones.</p><p>The drivers were soon called by name-\"Khaleed?\" \"Mamadou?\" \"Julio?\"-and brought into another room, where a Juno manager, Lucas Smith, was waiting for them with a laptop and an overhead projector. \"Drive Your Future,\" the slogan on the screen urged. A pink-skinned forty-year-old in jeans with a bushy red beard and an intense gaze, Smith joined Juno last January. Like several of his colleagues, he was recruited from Apple's retail division, where he conducted training sessions for Apple-store employees, based on Apple's carefully designed protocols. In fact, many details of the drivers' experience had been modelled on the interactions that customers have when they enter an Apple store, from the \"concierges\" who greeted them to the low driver-to-employee ratio.</p><p>At first, Smith was put off by the whiff of exploitation that he detected around rising Silicon Valley enterprises such as Instacart, where people buy your groceries for you, and TaskRabbit, where freelancers can underbid one another to take on errands and other jobs. In middle school, Smith told me, he was assigned a book by Ayn Rand. \"I remember finishing it, and realizing that I wanted to be the opposite of everything that was in that book,\" he said. \"Everything about the celebration of selfishness was just anathema.\"</p><p>So he was initially skeptical about Juno. \"I'm a super-progressive, and I have incredibly mixed feelings about the 'sharing economy' and companies like Uber,\" he said. \"Rather than creating wealth, they felt extractive. The kind of thing that happens when there's a bad job market and people don't have good choices. I try not to talk about our competitors, particularly, but the contrast for all these drivers is a powerful thing. They feel like they helped build other companies in New York, and, you know, as a reward for that, their rates kept getting lower.\"</p><p>The reference to \"other companies in New York\"-a.k.a. Uber-isn't incidental. Juno's business model is to take what Uber has created and appropriate it. Most of what Juno does is predicated on the fact that many drivers feel mistreated by Uber. (Lyft, for various reasons, seems to be less of a target of driver resentment, and is also a less powerful competitor.) If Uber seems cold and impersonal, Juno will smother its drivers with attention. If Uber has raised its commission-the part of each fare that the company keeps-Juno will set a much lower one.</p><p>From Uber's perspective, Juno must seem like a hermit crab, taking up residence in a home built by others. In many cases, Uber paid drivers a thousand-dollar bonus to sign up, and gave a thousand-dollar bounty to the driver who referred them. It helped the drivers get their taxi licenses. It built an app, trained consumers to download and use it, and battled regulators across the country. All Juno has had to do is come up with an app that looks and functions just like Uber's, and hire people like Lucas Smith to persuade those drivers to defect.</p><p>It was shortly after \"P.M., and five men entered the room and sat down in a semicircle. Their cell phones were tucked away in their pockets; Smith had their full attention. \"The fact that you're in this room, well, means that you're a professional,\" Smith said. To have been invited, in fact, all of them had to have an Uber rating higher than 4.65 (or a Lyft rating higher than 4.7). \"So I don't need to talk about the basics. When it comes to what makes Juno different, the biggest thing is our focus. That's behind everything we do. And that's that Juno is for drivers.\" He paused to fiddle with the lights. \"We built this company with the idea that listening to the drivers and building a business that puts drivers first isn't just the right thing to do-although we think it is-and it doesn't just mean that we're nice, although I think we are, but that it's also good business.\"</p><p>Smith moved through his slides and his talking points. The drivers learned that Juno's commission was ten per cent, \"guaranteed for our first twenty-four months.\" (Uber typically charges twenty-five per cent or more.) On a slide titled \"Example Fare,\" a bar chart showed a comparison between an Uber driver and a Juno driver on a thirty-dollar ride: the Uber driver, after commission and taxes and fees, would keep $19.11, while the Juno driver would get $23.61. \"For literally the same amount of work, you're taking home four dollars more,\" Smith said. \"And that's on one ride. Think about it on ten, over twenty.\" Juno was also offering twenty-four-hour support for its drivers, with a promise that you could always reach a real person on the phone, \"not a robot.\" Finally, Juno drivers could earn an ownership stake in the company, in the form of restricted stock units. \"I think this is a huge deal,\" Smith said. \"And it's totally unique.\"</p><p>To qualify, a driver had to drive for at least a hundred and twenty hours a month-approximately thirty hours a week-for twenty-four months out of thirty. The twist was that Juno was offering to count toward this goal the hours that its drivers were working for Uber and other companies, all of it clocked on their dashboard phones. Half of the two billion founding shares of the company had been set aside for this purpose, although they weren't going to be worth anything unless Juno was bought out by a larger company or had an I.P.O.</p><p> Smith went on, \"Now, once Juno goes public? And is traded on the stock exchange? You're an owner. You profit from that. You can sell your shares, you can hang on to them. But you'll profit from the growth of this company.\" There were some murmurs of approval among the drivers.</p><p>After the presentation, the drivers stood up and looked around. In a few moments, they would be collected by Juno staff members and given new Android phones with the Juno app, and then escorted to their cars, prepared to take Juno rides right away.</p><p>One of the drivers, a man with gray hair and glasses, told me that he was already driving for Juno. His name was Salim Sarder, and he was there with a friend who was hearing the pitch for the first time. Sarder said that Juno was more attractive on a ride-by-ride basis, but Uber had a lot more volume to offer. It was hard to toggle back and forth between the two while you were driving around, because if you turned down an Uber pickup to take one from Juno your Uber rating might take a hit. One of the many tyrannies of the sharing economy is the need to always keep your rating up.\"That's the thing right now,\" Sarder continued. \"You get Juno fare, but Uber gets closer-more people available there, you know?\"</p><p>Successful new technology companies are expected to grow quickly, even as they lose money, and Juno's expansion is almost entirely dependent on how swiftly it can poach drivers from the competition. The more drivers it has online, the shorter the wait times will be for passengers using the service. The shorter the wait times are-the more \"liquidity\" there is in the system-the more people will be willing to use it. According to Juno, the company has signed up more than fourteen thousand drivers since December. When I spoke to Juno employees in August, they said that they were getting around a hundred and fifty new drivers ready every day.</p><p>Later, I asked Smith if he could tell what the biggest attraction was for the new drivers they were seeing. The higher commission was a draw, for sure, but he thought that the stock grants were also a big factor. \"Hearing drivers talk about the ownership piece completely changes the equation,\" Smith said. \"I had one guy say-and this might sound made up-but he said he's been in this country, I think it was, for thirty-two years, and this was the first time he felt like an American. Now, that was super powerful, but it also made me feel a little bit sad. Because I would hope that there's more to feeling American than just owning the company.\"</p><p>Juno came about when its four co-founders realized that they had a lot of money and not a lot to do. It was October, 2014, and they had just sold their previous company, Viber, which was a competitor to Skype that allowed people to make calls and send texts by mobile phone for free, to a Japanese Internet company for nine hundred million dollars. The only question was what to embark on next. They were obviously \"too young to retire,\" in the words of Talmon Marco, Juno's C.E.O. \"It's going to be really boring,\" he said to himself at the time, contemplating a future of leisure at the age of forty-one. \"We're gonna sit by the beach all day?\"</p><p>A slender, soft-spoken Israeli with deep-set eyes and thick eyebrows, Marco serves as the public face of Juno, while his three partners run most of the company's operations from Tel Aviv. As he described how Juno was conceived, Marco was sitting in the company's U.S. headquarters, an open-plan space on the forty-seventh floor of 1 World Trade Center, with dazzling views of lower Manhattan and a telescope pointed in the direction of the building next door. Although Polaroids of the staff were pinned up on a wall, implying a goofy, collegial office culture, the place was eerily quiet, which was perhaps appropriate for a company that doesn't actually make anything and has relatively few employees; the drivers are independent contractors. The only real action took place at one end of the room on a large screen. It showed a map of Manhattan and Brooklyn, on which little car icons crawled around the grid like black carpet beetles.</p><p>The Juno founders knew that they wanted their new venture to serve consumers directly rather than provide a possibly more urgent but less glamorous behind-the-scenes product. \"There's something fun about building something that real people use,\" Marco said. \"Building something that you can talk to a regular person about and they will understand what it is that you do. If you do a resource-management-optimization algorithm for the back end of some sort of storage, O.K., fine. Great. Go explain that. 'Hey, babe, how's it going? I do research optimization.'\u00a0\"</p><p>They briefly considered the online-lending business, but there was no obvious hole for them to fill. There was a lot of negative press at the time about Uber. There had been accusations of several hit-and-run accidents involving its drivers; lawsuits had been filed over the company's privacy standards; and Uber and its C.E.O., Travis Kalanick, were fighting with regulators around the world over the company's aggressive approach to entering new markets. There were complaints about Uber's \"surge\" policy of charging more when demand was higher. What really stood out to Marco and his colleagues, though, was how disaffected the company's drivers seemed to be. After launching, in 2010, and wooing drivers to use its network, Uber started cutting the prices it charged riders in some markets and increasing the commission the company took on each ride. In January, 2014, Uber announced that it was reducing fares in sixteen cities, in some places by as much as thirty-four per cent. Partly, this was an attempt to put taxi companies out of business; even public transportation seemed to be under threat when Uber argued that it could be cheaper for a couple of friends to share an Uber than to ride the bus. The company was also engaged in a price war with Lyft. Many people driving for Uber had acquired new cars and were making car payments out of their Uber earnings; suddenly, their incomes were going down. Uber was increasingly popular, but there was still a sense that the company was at war with its own workforce.</p><p>None of this put off Silicon Valley venture capitalists and other investors, who viewed the company as the transportation equivalent of Amazon. By 2014, investors were valuing Uber at seventeen billion dollars. Meanwhile, the company was solidifying its reputation as an uncaring employer that was hastening the decline of job security-the downside of the \"gig\" economy. \"Do we have an angle?\" Marco and his partners kept asking themselves as they read story after story featuring complaints from Uber's drivers. \"Uber drivers are not happy. Uber drivers are not happy.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It was like, hey, you know, there might be an opportunity here. Maybe you can get the drivers to switch to you. At the end of the day, this is a service that's powered by drivers.\"</p><p>Marco and his partners-Igor Magazinik, the company's chief technology officer; Ofer Samocha, who runs the company's servers and infrastructure; and Sunny Marueli, the \"chief anarchist\" and \"super-brilliant guy who can do anything\" (Marco's description)-started surveying the driving-people-around market more closely. Most of the drivers working for Uber were also working for Lyft, as well as for any number of smaller competitors. The drivers seemed to have little loyalty to any one company, and the companies-which weren't offering them health insurance, or even the promise of work beyond what they were doing for the next ten minutes-had no leverage to demand exclusivity.</p><p>Marco suggests that Juno was an opportunity to counter an injustice in the world: \"As the mantra goes, 'I was young and I needed the money.' Well, we weren't as young, and we did not need the money. We were not struggling to make it happen at any cost. We did not struggle to put food on the table. So we had the luxury of choosing to do something that was socially responsible.\" From another perspective, though, Juno was simply targeting what the partners reckoned was Uber's one vulnerability-what a hacker would call an \"exploit.\"</p><p>\"Uber has two things,\" Marco said. \"It treats its employees poorly, that's not that unique. I'm sure there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies, and on their Web sites you'll read, 'Our employees are our asset, yada yada,' but they still go on food stamps. But here's the thing. Walmart does not let you build, free of charge, or virtually free of charge, a Walmart next to every one of its Walmarts, and then, as its customers slowly show up, you can start taking Walmart's employees. Walmart still has to pay their salaries. But over time, when you're looking at the independent-contractor model, you can independently take joint custody over these workers. That's a unique, if you wish, weakness, in the sharing economy.\"</p><p>He went on, \"Look, the sharing economy is fascinating on one end, but, at the same time, without the proper checks and balances, we're going back to fifteen-year-old textile workers in Brooklyn working eighteen hours a day. The platform controls you, and there's always going to be somebody willing to do the same work for a penny less. And that model just squeezes everything out of you, out of the lower class. At least until the point in time when they come with the pitchforks.\"</p><p>The social mission had its limits. As Marco and his colleagues had done with their previous company, they were saving money by situating the bulk of their operations, or at least most of the white-collar jobs, in the repressive post-Soviet state of Belarus. It's much cheaper to hire computer engineers there than it is in the United States. When I asked Magazinik about this, during a video call to Juno's seventy-person office in Minsk, he was reluctant to say that lower salaries were the reason they were there. He and the other co-founders are based in Tel Aviv, where they all grew up, he said. \"In Israel, it's much harder to create such a big tech team in such a small time-the competition for talent is really hard,\" Magazinik told me. But he also acknowledged that they could hire five engineers in Belarus for the price of one in America.</p><p>The tech stuff wasn't Juno's strategic advantage, anyway. \"If I was going to compete with Google, I would compete on privacy,\" Arun Sundararajan, a professor at N.Y.U.'s business school and the author of the book \"The Sharing Economy,\" says. \"I can't compete with them on search-engine quality, because they've got all the best algorithms. So I compete on something that they can't respond to easily. With Uber, it's not quite as clear-cut, but if you look at all the different dimensions of their execution the driver relationship is the weakest, and it's not one that they can easily correct.\"</p><p>Driver recruitment, which started last December, proved surprisingly easy. Many drivers congregated online in driver forums and WhatsApp chat rooms, and word of the new company quickly spread. The service launched in April as a \"closed beta,\" which meant that it was still in a controlled-trial stage. In a few weeks, the volume of drivers interested in joining shot up. \"We had bookings months out,\" Jonathan McPhee, who runs Juno's recruitment efforts, said. (He likes the title \"people leader.\") \"We could barely open up enough bookings to satisfy the demand.\" Initially, the company was paying the drivers two hundred dollars to come in and listen to Juno's presentation, and then fifty dollars a week to keep the app running in their cars. Even though there weren't really any passengers to pick up yet, Juno was able to gather data about the drivers' traffic patterns through the Juno mobile devices that tracked their zigs and zags around the city. In May, the company moved into \"open beta,\" meaning that anyone could download the app and start using it if he or she had been invited by a driver. Since then, the company claims that its wait times in Manhattan have become competitive with Uber's. McPhee says that a driver will often tell him, \"I have so much activity, I don't even need to turn on my Uber app.\"</p><p>The question, then, is how long Juno can sustain its driver-defection strategy against a competitor as well fortified as Uber. When I spoke with Uber's head of North American operations, Rachel Holt, she told me that the company's vision is to be \"as reliable as running water everywhere and for everyone.\" As it pursues that goal, Uber is watching Juno with defensiveness and skepticism. \"I'd be very surprised if a ten-per-cent commission is going to continue for a long time, if ultimately a business is there to be sustainable,\" Holt told me, sitting with her arms crossed on a couch in Uber's sleek, fifty-five-thousand-square-foot offices in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The company had thought about the commission a lot, she said, and the economics just didn't work. She added that Uber had tried to get permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to give stock options to its drivers, and was told that, as long as the drivers were independent contractors rather than employees, it wasn't allowed. Indeed, one legal expert I spoke with said that giving restricted stock options to thousands of contractors might pose regulatory problems. \"Look, if there's something we can learn around a different way to approach that, we would love to assess how that works,\" Holt said. \"If there's something very compelling in what they're offering to drivers, we want to continue to learn from that.\"</p><p>Several venture capitalists suggested to me that Uber was now so big and so rich-its estimated worth is close to sixty-eight billion dollars-that it was basically impossible for any new company to dislodge it. In an industry where size and brand recognition are crucial factors, Uber has become a cultural buzzword, conjured by other entrepreneurs pitching their own ideas: the Uber of toothbrush heads, the Uber of car parking, the Uber of pets. Uber is the thing that everyone else wants to emulate, which makes it enormously successful at raising money.</p><p>The service is available in seventy-two countries, and has raised more than fifteen billion dollars; it is branching out into auto-lending, food-delivery, and courier services. I was repeatedly told that consumers summoning Ubers want their cars to come quickly, and that they don't really care about the fine print of the drivers' compensation. Uber had created a kind of moat around itself, and that moat was made of a seemingly limitless supply of investor dollars. Money shielded it from many of the pressures and compromises that a business operating under more normal conditions would face.</p><p>In the first six months of 2016, Uber sustained $1.2 billion in losses, a stunning amount. (Even Amazon never lost as much in so short a time.) In total, according to Bloomberg, the company has lost four billion dollars, almost a quarter of what it has raised from investors. A good chunk of it went into a costly effort to establish itself in China-an effort it recently abandoned. But the company's ongoing costs are significant. One major expense is bringing drivers into its network, and replacing them when they leave; driving is a \"high churn\" career. Each time the company goes out to ask for more money, though, investors fight for the opportunity. \"With Uber, their disruption was, they really weaponized money,\" said Simon Rothman, a partner at the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners, who founded eBay Motors and was an early adviser to Lyft. \"Now someone else has to do something equally disruptive, and I don't know if being nicer and more fair financially with drivers is enough.\"</p><p>Given Uber's wealth and its backers' patience, it can subsidize its rides indefinitely. Marco has been meeting with investors-in March, TechCrunch reported that Juno was attempting to raise thirty million dollars-but the funders I spoke with told me that they would not give Juno their money, because its challenges sounded too daunting. By the time the far-off future arrives when investors demand that Uber show an over-all profit, its competitors are likely to have gone out of business.</p><p>The search for instructive precedents quickly leads to a company called Sidecar, which started in 2011, in San Francisco, as one of the first ride-sharing businesses. Sidecar introduced a number of innovations that were quickly copied by its competitors: having drivers use their own cars; the term \"ride-sharing\"; giving drivers directions on their smartphones. The company's co-founder, Sunil Paul, has a patent dating back to 2002 for a technology that seems to underpin the whole industry: a method of sending a signal from a passenger's cell phone to a central server and then to the closest available driver for a pickup, and of tracking the subsequent ride. Sidecar raised and burned through thirty-nine million dollars, and shut down in 2015; whatever was left was bought by General Motors.</p><p>\"We were the inventors and the innovators,\" Paul told me, ruefully. \"But it wasn't enough to overcome the money.\" The only companies that could possibly compete with Uber now, he thought, were giants such as Apple and Google. \"We got run over by the Uber money truck, in lots of different ways,\" Paul said. \"I don't see much hope for a company like Juno, just to be perfectly blunt about it.\"</p><p>After Lucas Smith's presentation, I joined a Juno specialist named Farhan Noor, who was helping a driver complete the on-boarding process. \"This is the driver agreement,\" Noor said. \"Before we do that, I want to verify your car. We're driving a 2015?\"</p><p>\"It's a Nissan Pathfinder,\" the driver, Jaime Bitar, said.</p><p>\"A Pathfinder, that's a nice car,\" Noor said.</p><p>Bitar was dressed in a black suit and a patterned tie. He stood in front of a white curtain while Noor took his picture with his iPad. \"You should see my Uber photo,\" Bitar joked. \"I took it in the car.\"</p><p>Noor then pulled accessories out of the kind of black velvet sachet that one might expect to contain a pearl necklace: a ZTE phone, a charging cable, and a dashboard mount. The phone was programmed to display a promotional ad to the passengers in the back of the car: \"Save 25% on your next ride. Ask your driver.\" This way, while the driver was working for Uber, a customer might ask about the ad, and the driver could send the customer a text message with a link to download the Juno app. (It's against Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission rules for drivers to solicit their passengers.) Once a new customer took his or her first Juno ride, the driver got a fifteen-dollar bonus.</p><p>At some point in the future, the likes of Bitar and his Pathfinder may be out of the picture anyway. In 2011, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of the Google X lab, announced at the annual TED conference that self-driving cars would usher in a new world, one where there were no automobile accidents, parking lots, or car-insurance premiums. Since then, a number of major corporations have made serious investments in autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Nobody knows when such a future might arrive. (Five years? Fifty years? You hear different things.) But everyone in the personal-transportation business is preoccupied with it. In August, Uber revealed that it was going to introduce a small group of self-driving Volvo XC90 S.U.V.s onto the streets of Pittsburgh, although they will still have drivers in the front seat. \"I think the opportunity to totally transform the way people transport themselves and goods is just a massive opportunity,\" a banking executive who follows Uber closely assured me. \"It's a huge segment of the economy, which is very inefficient. That is why Uber has grown so large so quickly.\" He pointed out that Dublin, California, east of Oakland, would be offering taxpayer-subsidized vouchers to its citizens to use on Uber or Lyft rather than spending government money on maintaining some of its public bus lines.</p><p>\"It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,\" Marco said of the driverless era. \"With Juno or without Juno, this is going to happen.\" He added that with Uber the drivers would just be \"deactivated, and thrown away like a used whatever.\" Juno might not need them anymore, either, but they'd still have stock ownership in the company. \"This is the first time since the industrial revolution when there was a class of workers who are going to have a piece of the future rather than just being laid off,\" Marco said. He didn't mention the prospect that the piece of the future may have no value.</p><p>A world of driverless cars could pose a far greater threat to Uber than Juno's kinder-copycat strategy. It could take any number of forms, from a subscription model, where consumers pay an annual fee to have access to an autonomous car whenever they need it, to a system more like Zipcar, where people pay on a per-use basis. Car sharing or fractional ownership could become widespread. Considering the number of possible arrangements, there's no reason to assume that any of today's ride-summoning firms will be dominant forces in an era without drivers. There was a time when AOL, the leading service provider in the dial-up era, was expected to own the future of the Internet, just as Blockbuster was expected to dominate video rentals for years to come.</p><p>When I asked Marco why he was so sure that Juno would still be around, he said, half jokingly, that he had acquired all the wisdom he needed by reading \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" by Douglas Adams. \"Oh, my God,\" he said. \"It's the Bible. Everything is there.\"</p><p>In the novel, the main character reflects at one point that the earth was pretty much ruined by all the cars. His name is Arthur Dent. One of his non-terrestrial sidekicks calls himself Ford Prefect, having concluded, after visiting earth, that cars were the planet's dominant life form. But Adams's unflattering view of automotive transport didn't seem to be what Marco had in mind.</p><p>I asked Marco to share what he had learned from the book, and he hesitated. \"Now you're putting me on the spot,\" he said. After thinking for a few seconds, he went on, \"It claims that the math never works in a restaurant, which explains why the bill never adds up.\" He wasn't sure if that was still true, because, he said, he stopped looking at restaurant checks a long time ago-pre\u00ebmptively handing your credit card to the server saves the five minutes it takes to get the bill, look at it, and send it back with the payment.</p><p>\"It was a very popular book, especially when I was growing up, among geeks in the eighties and nineties,\" Marco went on. \"You have to ask the founders of Snapchat.\"\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1016_23</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KYK-DMJ1-DYWH-900V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

Been asked to fund a demo that had no substance? Or been deluged in instant messenger chatter at work, because your company decreed that \"open collaboration\" was more valuable than your concentration? You may be surprised that these modern phenomena owe something to the late Jeffrey Epstein's thirst for respectability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has emerged that Epstein, a convicted paedophile who committed suicide in prison after being arrested for child sex trafficking, funded the intellectual vanguardistas of Big Tech, and the reputational fallout has sent a chill through this well-connected elite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scandal is also claiming some high-profile casualties. Following an investigation by Ronan Farrow  , the reporter who brought down Harvey Weinstein, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's world-famous Media Lab, Joichi Ito, resigned in disgrace last week. The cherubic 53-year-old Japanese-American had also enjoyed board memberships of 20 wealthy foundations and companies, including The New York Times. After Farrow's devastating article, Ito relinquished these posts, along with his only British directorship, of LSE-listed PureTech Health.</p><p>Ito had used Epstein to procure funding both for his own investment vehicles, as well as the Media Lab, despite knowing of Epstein's conviction and his toxic reputation. Ito appears to have concealed the extent of his involvement to faculty and staff, referring to Epstein as Voldemort, the Harry Potter embodiment of evil: \"he who must not be named\".</p><p>Appointed in 2011, in any other era Ito would have been be a bizarre choice to lead a prominent new department at MIT. Such prized roles at an institution that forged its reputation in the space race were traditionally occupied by distinguished engineers and scientists. And before Silicon Valley, America's computing industry was clustered around Boston and the university, with giants like DEC and IBM eager to snap up graduates.</p><p>Yet by his own admission, Ito wasn't technical and wasn't even a \"reading or writing\" kind of guy. He had dropped out of a Harvard physics course in dismay, after being sternly told he couldn't \"intuit\" a physics concept being taught that day, but had to \"learn\" it instead. His venture capital fund (and blog) was called Neoteny, meaning extended childhood or the delaying of adulthood.</p><p>But the Media Lab was always an unusual and exotic flower in the MIT garden, producing graduates like Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed. The institution's legacy is less in its output - for very little has proved commercially successful let alone a landmark in human endeavour - and more in pioneering a new kind of glib futurist or networker. It is a role that has crossed the Atlantic with ease, notes one British inventor and entrepreneur. \"In Oxford at the moment, it seems that every other person is writing a book about 'AI ethics' or setting up a futurology institute,\" laments Andrew Fentem, who pioneered the multitouch technology that provided the foundation for the smartphone boom.</p><p>Fentem calls this \"a new professional class of the innovation guru\", self-appointed experts in all things novel, who began to emerge from business schools and quangos in the early Nineties. \"They go to TED talks and business school events about disruptive innovation. While they love talking about AI and 'the blockchain', they'd struggle to connect up their hi-fi.\"</p><p>Besides a puppyish enthusiasm for the internet, Ito's calling card was a brief association with the late LSD guru Timothy Leary. Apple founder Steve Jobs had also been influenced by LSD and enthused about the personal computer as a \"bicycle for the mind\". Unlike Jobs, however, Ito viewed psychedelics and computers as a utopian instrument for reconfiguring society and politics, as intrinsically moral, and unambiguously good.</p><p>While Ito's New Age musings scarcely amount to a coherent adult philosophy, he was consistent in battling what he saw as the shackles of intellectual property laws, and steered the wealthy foundations to support the agenda. \"Ito was part of a circle that believed that intellectual property rights represented a barrier to innovation and were a legacy to be disrupted,\" says Neil Turkewitz, a former executive for the recording industry lobby group RIAA, who locked horns with the techno utopians at international meetings.</p><p>\"Consequences were irrelevant in Silicon Valley's quest to be free from regulatory burdens or the rule of law,\" he adds.</p><p>With Western companies facing the theft of their own ideas by piratical Chinese rivals, Ito's radical attempts to dismantle intellectual property rights may appear less shrewd today.</p><p>Another more subtle consequence was organisational gurus' enthusiasm for open collaboration - hence Slack chats, and design features such as open office plans. According to the open collaboration enthusiasts, the sheer volume of communication is diagnostic for the health of a company. Only recently have other business experts questioned the idea that more chatter isn't necessarily better.</p><p>The Media Lab story goes back 30 years to the height of the Reagan era. The institution was the brainchild of Nicholas Negroponte, then a well-connected professor at MIT. Negroponte envisaged a new kind of academia. The Lab would be a flashy demo vehicle for new media. While publishers were sceptical, it acquired the backing of the East Coast's blue chip computer establishment, IBM and DEC, also nervous about missing the next big thing.</p><p>A shrewd networker, Negroponte had been a speaker at the first TED conference in 1984; it was at TED that he first met the husband and wife founders of Wired magazine. Negroponte became the first investor in the magazine, negotiating himself a backpage column to promote himself and Lab's ideas.</p><p>The Lab earned Negroponte the reputation as the \"PT Barnum of science\", in reference to the 19th century American circus owner credited with the aphorism \"there's a sucker born every minute\". A shortlived Media Lab in Ireland ended in disaster, the Irish auditor condemning large severance packages, and only 12 worthless patents to show for $40m (\u00a332m).</p><p>Negroponte brushed off the sneers, confident that his declamatory style of futurism was a potent social tool.</p><p>\"Once you have an impact \u2026 you become part of a new elite,\" he said.</p><p>And Wired magazine proved its value to his project. The veteran tech journalist John Dvorak recalls being given a tour of the Media Lab with the publisher Will Hearst, and coming away unimpressed.</p><p>\"It was a big scam from the beginning - I saw everything they were doing, but I didn't see any original thinking going on.\" Today Dvorak is more charitable: he views Ito as a \"fall guy\" for an academic experiment that has outlived its original purpose.</p><p>The Lab's impressive sounding list of achievements turn out to be much less spectacular on closer examination. In a 2016 video, Ito claims the Lab pioneered today's \"wearables\" such as the Fitbit and Apple Watch.</p><p>But it was the Japanese consumer electronics industry who pioneered this field; you can see a Seiko TV watch on Roger Moore's wrist in the 1983 Bond movie Octopussy. Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child initiative, intended to produce a $100 laptop for emerging countries, was the most public flop. On Media Lab's own terms it hardly mattered. Ito was realising Negroponte's dream of a new \"elite\".</p><p>Fall guy or not, Ito's reign is under fire for embodying the dubious morals of a technology industry now under much closer scrutiny.</p><p>MIT Media Lab researcher C\u00e9sar Hidalgo called Ito \"a fake scholar building an 'academic' career with blog posts and ghost writers\". His fall was \"much deserved\", Kara Swisher wrote in The New York Times.</p><p>Faced with a China that increasingly innovates rather than copies, the Lab's priorities seem oddly whimsical. Under Ito, the Lab chased trends such as cryptocurrencies and a sideways move into indoor agriculture has come up short; one potential job applicant compared it to what the commercial industry had been doing almost 20 years ago.</p><p>\"Those who do engineering have become completely separate from the people who are provided with a platform to pontificate about their future tech visions,\" notes Fentem. The Lab's future may depend more on rebuilding with adult supervision with a more rigorous engineer as director, rather than the whims of a zeitgeistchasing networker. It may be time for less talk, more walk.</p><p>Andrew Orlowski is a technology writer and analyst Train of thought The world according to Ito Permanent childhood \"It's time we listen to children and allow neoteny to guide us beyond the rigid frameworks and dogma created by adults.\"</p><p>Dream machines \"AI and robots may help us begin to imagine that perhaps humans are just one instance of consciousness and that 'humanity' is a bit overrated.\"</p><p>Help the new aged \"Emergence is our religion\" Friends of friends Ito's allies in the tech aristocracy Larry Lessig One of the leaders of the open source software movement and an activist against copyright laws, Lessig is a powerful Ito loyalist. He signed a \"We support Joi\" petition after some of Media Lab's links to Epstein were exposed and followed up with a blog claiming his friend was a \"scapegoat\".</p><p>Larry Page The co-founder of Google and Ito go way back. In a 2003 blog post entitled \"Chillin' with Larry Page\", after meeting at Davos, Ito describes approvingly how they \"hung out in an office that looked more like a living room with lots of gadgets and toys\".</p><p>Reid Hoffman The billionaire founder of LinkedIn, a Media Lab sponsor, defended Ito in emails to author Anand Giridharadas, who accused him of \"hiding behind bureaucracy\". Hoffman once said Ito \"makes well-networked professionals look like hermits\".</p><p>'It was a big scam from the beginning - I saw all that they were doing, but I didn't see any original thinking'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-152936697</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X27-2CG1-DYTY-C17M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 15, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU</classCode><className>Arrests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CTIZ</classCode><className>SCANDALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RNX</classCode><className>INSTANT MESSAGING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D92R</classCode><className>CHILD TRAFFICKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001930</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4JU</classCode><className>CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001555</classCode><className>SEX OFFENSES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Sex Crimes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CW3N</classCode><className>COMPUTING &amp;

New announcements, particularly those from Apple,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smartcompany.com.au/technology/43662-apple-s-iphone-6-announcement-a-victory-for-hype-over-innovation-control-shift.html\">are nearly inescapable</url>. But what goes on in the lead-up to these big product reveals?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a mobile phone from the drawing board to a finished product in stores takes around 12 to 18 months. However, it can take significantly longer for new product categories, designs, or if a major rewrite of a device's operating system is involved.</p><p>One aspect of the process a lot of people don't fully appreciate is that developing a prototype of a product is a very different proposition to putting it into mass production.</p><p>It might be possible for a team of four or five engineers to hand-build a prototype of a device, or a small number of units. However, coming up with a design that can be produced cheaply and efficiently on a factory floor in volumes of a million units or more with a low defect rate is a whole different ball game.</p><p>Back in the early 1980s, for example, engineers at now defunct computer manufacturer Commodore figured out how to create a working touch screen for the venerable Commodore 64. Unfortunately, with technology and manufacturing techniques standing as they did back then, mass producing a touchscreen monitor was simply not financially viable.</p><p>A low defect rate is an especially important consideration when refining a design for production, because the working units need to be sold with enough margin to cover the cost of any defective units that need to be thrown away.</p><p>For example, one of the big innovations that made the 1980s home computer revolution was that a company called <url normalizedValue=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502\">MOS Technologies</url> worked out a way to significantly reduce the defect rate of its processors. This, in turn, made it possible to put these processors into a range of low-cost consumer devices, from the original Apple II to the Atari 2600, BBC Micro B and Nintendo NES, where these devices would not have been viable otherwise.</p><p>Likewise, where it might be possible to custom manufacture a mould for a prototype at a local tool shop; this is not an option for mass-produced tech devices. So each component of a device also needs to be put into mass production, before the pieces can be assembled into a finished product and shipped.</p><p>So often, a group of engineers at a company will first prototype a new design, then it will be refined ahead of a small test run of \"engineering samples\" where the device's design will be refined to make it easier to manufacture, before it gets placed into full production.</p><p>Along the way, new mobile phones need to go through a rigorous process of tests from mobile phone carriers (after all, if there are issues with a phone, they want to know about it before they offer them subsidised on a plan) and government regulators. Often in multiple countries, and sometimes requiring devices to be modified as a result.</p><p>Of course, no one wants to buy a new device, only to find there is no content that runs on it. That's why in the middle of the year, before the big tech releases, most tech companies run developer conferences where new platforms and developer kits are unveiled. They want the tools to be in the hands of developers and content in the store before it reaches consumers.</p><p>Finally, device manufacturers need to manufacture enough components and assemble them into finished devices in order to fill up their supply channel. Managing the logistics of this is a nightmare in and of itself.</p><p>Because of the length of the process, companies will often have the next iteration of a device somewhere in the pipeline even as the latest model is being released. While it all sounds so easy in theory, in practice - being technology - something goes horribly wrong.</p><p>Somewhere along this long and risk-filled process, the new device will be introduced to the public. How far that official announcement takes place carries with it both risks and opportunities for the company developing the product.</p><p>For example, during the 1980s, a company called Osborne Computer Corporation announced their next model a full year before it was introduced to the market. Understandably, consumers waited until the new, more powerful model came out rather than buying the existing model. In a chain of events known as \"the Osborne effect\", its sales eventually tanked and the company filed for bankruptcy as a result.</p><p>On the other hand, an early announcement of a forthcoming product can also be used to get consumers to hold off from buying a competitor's existing product. This is a tactic known as \"fear, uncertainty and doubt\" or FUD, and is precisely what Apple is attempting by announcing its smartwatch before it's ready to hit stores, while competitors such as LG, Samsung and Motorola have already begun selling theirs.</p><p>Of course, if your company can keep a secret, another option is announcing a new product late in the process, just as it's about to hit stores. This can mean your competitors spend 18 months scrambling on R&amp;D while you have the market to yourself. If you ever wondered why Apple is so secretive, this is why.</p><p>Finally, \"accidentally\" leaking details to selected tech reporters in the lead-up to your big announcement is always a good option.

Congress questions Big Tech. Teachers\u2019 unions push back on school reopenings. And Europe struggles to contain autocracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Union seems to be functioning better than the United States in some big ways right now. Europe has been far more successful in subduing the coronavirus. It has also passed a recent economic stimulus bill, while the U.S. Congress has not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Europe has a major problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has a rising autocratic movement that the continent\u2019s leaders have no clear strategy for confronting. If anything, the pandemic has strengthened the most autocratic E.U. governments, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">in Hungary and Poland</url>. Other countries have put a higher priority on fighting the virus and helping the economy than trying to stop the erosion of democracy.</p><p>As my colleague Matina Stevis-Gridneff, who covers the European Union from Brussels, told me, \u201cThe leading E.U. member states have been willing to partly turn a blind eye to achieve realpolitik gains right now.\u201d</p><p>The background: Hungary\u2019s governing party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">undermined democracy</url> by changing election rules, packing the courts with allies and insisting on uncritical media coverage. Orban has used the virus as an excuse to centralize authority even further.</p><p>Poland\u2019s governing party, led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, has taken a similar approach, mostly by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">neutralizing the judicial system</url>.</p><p>When the E.U. expanded to include Hungary, Poland and six other countries in 2004, the bloc\u2019s leaders made the mistake of assuming that Eastern and Central Europe were on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">a one-way path to democracy</url> and the rule of law. (The na\u00efvet\u00e9 bears some resemblance to American assumptions about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">how China would democratize</url> after joining global trade treaties.)</p><p>As a result, the E.U. did not create an easy process for punishing countries that move away from democracy. Doing so can require either a unanimous vote or a supermajority, and Hungary and Poland have defeated either.</p><p>Some European officials pushed for a tougher approach in the recent stimulus bill, but in the end, the E.U. leaders chose to avoid a big fight during a crisis. Afterward, Orban gloated about winning \u201ca very important battle.\u201d (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">This Times analysis</url> does a nice job of explaining the debate.)</p><p>There are no easy answers here. Allowing autocracy to flourish may encourage its rise in other countries. But confronting it risks pulling the E.U. apart.</p><p>\u201cIn the long run, it seems to me, rule of law issues will undermine the E.U.,\u201d Steven Erlanger, The Times\u2019s chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe, says.</p><p>FOUR MORE BIG STORIES</p><p>1.

Without adequate safety provisions, some unions have threatened to strike.</p><p>Critics say the unions are being inflexible and trying to have it both ways: reluctant to return to school, but also resistant to teaching online. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep saying you\u2019re scared.

Later this week, Facebook, Twitter and Google will be forced to testify to US politicians over claims that they unwittingly helped rig a presidential election. By allowing fake news and murky advertising campaigns to thrive on their websites, the companies are accused of no less than being complicit in the erosion of American democracy. One can hardly imagine a more serious charge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across Europe, Apple, Google and Amazon are battered with accusations and fines over alleged abuses of monopoly power and unpaid taxes. YouTube has been fingered as an ally to terrorists for failing to remove extremist videos and bomb making guides.</p><p>Elsewhere, economists and politicians fret about the effect that the biggest tech companies will have on jobs and wages as their artificial intelligence advances continue. Experts despair at what social media and technology are doing to our brains: various studies point to Facebook making us depressed and mobile phones making us stupider . Recent magazine articles have asked if smartphones have \"destroyed a generation\" and, referring to the social media giant's fake news scandals, that \"this could be the end of Facebook\" .</p><p>Now, look at the tech company's situation another way. Last week, shares in Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company,  rose to all-time highs after the companies all reported booming sales, their strategies executed flawlessly. Facebook is widely expected to do the same this week: during a year in which the company has faced unprecedented scrutiny, its market capitalisation has risen by almost 50pc to surpass $500bn.</p><p>Apple stores will open on Friday to huge lines as eager shoppers race to get their hands on the new iPhone; the company's biggest problem is making enough of them to meet demand .\u00a0</p><p>What tech backlash?Credit:      EPA     </p><p>Even Twitter, which for so long seemed like the forgotten child, is on the up, saying it could make a profit in the current quarter.</p><p>It seems like a contradiction. The charges against big tech are not inconsequential - indeed, they have never been under so much pressure. But this has seemingly failed to have any impact on their success.</p><p>In Washington, politicians are speaking out loud about regulating the internet giants, in Europe it is already happening. Google's (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine from the European Commission in June should have sent a chill through Silicon Valley for the precedent it set:\u00a0using the dominance of one platform to give yourself an advantage in another - the very thing Google was fined for - is a common tactic of big tech companies. Brought to its logical conclusion, this charge could be levelled at any of them. Bigger fines are expected in the coming months.\u00a0</p><p>But when Google was fined, its shares barely moved. The biggest antitrust penalty in European history wasn't even brought up during last week's results. As for any supposed backlash against Facebook, the numbers - 2bn log on each month and millions join every week - tell a different picture.</p><p>The clearest and most likely reason for this is that the tide has not turned against big tech at all. Its growing power may worry those with the biggest microphones, but they are as popular as ever with consumers. And why not? Their services are convenient, and getting better all the time. Big tech companies repeatedly top lists for consumer satisfaction and brand trust; in one recent poll, Google was given an approval rating of 88pc and Amazon 77pc, numbers that politicians, and most other companies, would kill for.</p><p>YouTube has been in the spotlight over failing to take down extremist videosCredit:      PA     </p><p>Compared to banks, energy companies or airlines, they are seen as innovative, even cuddly.</p><p>Just as importantly, they create huge consumer surpluses. Google and Facebook cost nothing for consumers to use, but their services - universal access to information and staying in touch with hundreds of friends - are hugely valuable. People pay in another way, by giving away their data and time, but to many this isn't the Faustian pact it is often made out to be.\u00a0 On the contrary it seems like a bargain, especially since compared to other large companies, tech giants are actually fairly good at keeping data safe.\u00a0</p><p>To Amazon users, the site does not mean the gradual collapse of the high street, but low prices and instant availability. Uber means the same: the company's misdeeds are well documented, but Transport for London's decision last month to revoke its London licence generated a huge backlash. TfL was criticised as backwards and anti-innovation.</p><p>Uber's fight with London is helped by popularity among consumersCredit:      AP     </p><p>Despite its decision, very few expect to see Uber actually disappear from London (the company continues to operate as it appeals the decision). Certainly Uber itself, which is continuing to sign up drivers apace, does not.</p><p>It is possible that tech investors are underestimating the movements in powerful circles against the industry's titans. Certainly, they are not too big to be reined in: Microsoft's position looked unassailable in the late 1990s, but its lengthy and debilitating battle with the US government threatened to bring the company to its knees; it certainly distracted the company enough for it to paralyse it against newcomers like Google.</p><p>But there is no grassroots rebellion against big tech. Their popularity will only make life harder for any government that tries to curb them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-38516570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PV1-5X01-JCJY-G1CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><timeReceived>5:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 29, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

While Twitter took action on the posts, including one about the protests with the incendiary comment that \"looting\" will lead to \"shooting,\" Facebook and Zuckerberg chose to do nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook now faces an insurrection, as employees publicly criticized Zuckerberg's decision and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/tech/facebook-employees-twitter/index.html\">staged a virtual walkout</url>.

Social media platforms that became communication lifelines and created hubs for reliable coronavirus information are now back to facing calls to be regulated. Video conferencing platform Zoom acquired millions of users but has also been hit with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/tech/zoom-ceo-apology-privacy/index.html\">series of controversies</url> over privacy and security. And Amazon, which became a as states imposed lockdowns, has faced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/tech/amazon-lawsuit-coronavirus-warehouse/index.html\">ongoing scrutiny of warehouse worker conditions</url>.</p><p>\"That was never going to last,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford University's law school who focuses on platform regulation and internet users' rights. \"There was a lull, but I think the lull is over.\"</p><p>Keller said social media platforms in particular may have been given a bit of a pass in how they handled issues such as content moderation and misinformation during the pandemic, with a greater willingness to take down and rely on greater use of automated processes, as opposed to human review.</p><p>\"There was pretty broad consensus that this was an emergency and you could take emergency measures and forfeit some other priorities in the name of public health,\" she said.</p><p>Now, Trump is targeting these same companies with an executive order aimed at weakening some legal protections for social media platforms. The order seeks to dilute Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that protects online platforms from being sued for content their users post. There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/politics/trump-social-media-order-legal-limits/index.html\">serious doubts</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/tech/amazon-dominance-coronavirus/index.html\">vital lifeline for many</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/tech/covid-viral-misinformation/index.html\">dangerous coronavirus content</url> as to how far Trump can legally regulate companies like Facebook and Twitter, and his executive order has already been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/twitter-executive-order-lawsuit/index.html\">challenged in court</url>.</p><p>But while the executive order itself may run into legal constraints, Trump's public broadsides against social media platforms could give added momentum to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/tech/section-230-doj/index.html\">multiple efforts</url> from to tweak Section 230 and make the platforms more accountable.</p><p>Regulators also continue to scrutinize the broader power that Big Tech wields.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who previously was in regular contact with the White House during the pandemic, has more recently been called on to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/tech/house-judiciary-bezos-testimony/index.html\">testify before Congress</url> about his company's alleged misuse of data.</p><p>In fact, the health crisis could end up giving additional public momentum to efforts to rein in the tech industry, despite - or even because of - how vital it has proven during the pandemic.</p><p>\"I think what we are seeing as a result of the crisis is that more and more people are depending on these platforms, which just highlights how powerful they are,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"I think people are noticing in more areas of their life, that there are very few legal protections that people and companies have for their interactions with these platforms.\"</p><p>If all that wasn't enough, the ongoing national conversation around race, sparked by mass protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody last month, could prove to be another source of scrutiny for the tech industry.

While Twitter took action on the posts, including one about the protests with the incendiary comment that \"looting\" will lead to \"shooting,\" Facebook and Zuckerberg chose to do nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook now faces an insurrection, as employees publicly criticized Zuckerberg's decision and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/tech/facebook-employees-twitter/index.html\">staged a virtual walkout</url>.

Social media platforms that became communication lifelines and created hubs for reliable coronavirus information are now back to facing calls to be regulated. Video conferencing platform Zoom acquired millions of users but has also been hit with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/tech/zoom-ceo-apology-privacy/index.html\">series of controversies</url> over privacy and security. And Amazon, which became a as states imposed lockdowns, has faced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/tech/amazon-lawsuit-coronavirus-warehouse/index.html\">ongoing scrutiny of warehouse worker conditions</url>.</p><p>\"That was never going to last,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford University's law school who focuses on platform regulation and internet users' rights. \"There was a lull, but I think the lull is over.\"</p><p>Keller said social media platforms in particular may have been given a bit of a pass in how they handled issues such as content moderation and misinformation during the pandemic, with a greater willingness to take down and rely on greater use of automated processes, as opposed to human review.</p><p>\"There was pretty broad consensus that this was an emergency and you could take emergency measures and forfeit some other priorities in the name of public health,\" she said.</p><p>Now, Trump is targeting these same companies with an executive order aimed at weakening some legal protections for social media platforms. The order seeks to dilute Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that protects online platforms from being sued for content their users post. There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/politics/trump-social-media-order-legal-limits/index.html\">serious doubts</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/tech/amazon-dominance-coronavirus/index.html\">vital lifeline for many</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/tech/covid-viral-misinformation/index.html\">dangerous coronavirus content</url> as to how far Trump can legally regulate companies like Facebook and Twitter, and his executive order has already been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/twitter-executive-order-lawsuit/index.html\">challenged in court</url>.</p><p>But while the executive order itself may run into legal constraints, Trump's public broadsides against social media platforms could give added momentum to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/tech/section-230-doj/index.html\">multiple efforts</url> from to tweak Section 230 and make the platforms more accountable.</p><p>Regulators also continue to scrutinize the broader power that Big Tech wields.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who previously was in regular contact with the White House during the pandemic, has more recently been called on to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/tech/house-judiciary-bezos-testimony/index.html\">testify before Congress</url> about his company's alleged misuse of data.</p><p>In fact, the health crisis could end up giving additional public momentum to efforts to rein in the tech industry, despite - or even because of - how vital it has proven during the pandemic.</p><p>\"I think what we are seeing as a result of the crisis is that more and more people are depending on these platforms, which just highlights how powerful they are,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"I think people are noticing in more areas of their life, that there are very few legal protections that people and companies have for their interactions with these platforms.\"</p><p>If all that wasn't enough, the ongoing national conversation around race, sparked by mass protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody last month, could prove to be another source of scrutiny for the tech industry.

On any given day, as the coronavirus spread, you might find Zuckerberg interviewing the top infectious disease expert in the United States, touting efforts from his non-profit organization to fund research into the virus and talking about Facebook's long-standing mission to connect people, this time with new resonance as millions found themselves cut off from the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But whatever renewed goodwill there might have been for Facebook seemed to unravel in a matter of days thanks to the company's handling of a few controversial posts from President Donald Trump. While Twitter took action on the posts, including one about the protests with the incendiary comment that \"looting\" will lead to \"shooting,\" Facebook and Zuckerberg chose to do nothing.</p><p>Facebook now faces an insurrection, as employees publicly criticized Zuckerberg's decision and staged a virtual walkout. At least one staffer quit over it. And even scientists backed by Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization have urged him to rethink his decision. </p><p>During a contentious town hall with employees earlier this month, Zuckerberg reportedly appeared to acknowledge that the good times were over. \"It felt to me that over the last couple of months there was this brief moment of unity with our response on Covid, where it felt like we were all in this together,\" the Facebook CEO said, according to the New York Times. Facebook did not respond when asked to confirm Zuckerberg's remarks. </p><p>While Facebook's comedown has arguably been the most severe, it mirrors a broader whiplash that has taken place across the tech industry since the early days of the pandemic. Social media platforms that became communication lifelines and created hubs for reliable coronavirus information are now back to facing calls to be regulated. Video conferencing platform Zoom acquired millions of users but has also been hit with a series of controversies over privacy and security. And Amazon, which became a vital lifeline for many as states imposed lockdowns, has faced ongoing scrutiny of warehouse worker conditions. </p><p>\"That was never going to last,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford University's law school who focuses on platform regulation and internet users' rights. \"There was a lull, but I think the lull is over.\" </p><p>Keller said social media platforms in particular may have been given a bit of a pass in how they handled issues such as content moderation and misinformation during the pandemic, with a greater willingness to take down dangerous coronavirus content and rely on greater use of automated processes, as opposed to human review.</p><p>\"There was pretty broad consensus that this was an emergency and you could take emergency measures and forfeit some other priorities in the name of public health,\" she said. </p><p>Now, Trump is targeting these same companies with an executive order aimed at weakening some legal protections for social media platforms. The order seeks to dilute Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that protects online platforms from being sued for content their users post. There are serious doubts as to how far Trump can legally regulate companies like Facebook and Twitter, and his executive order has already been challenged in court. </p><p>But while the executive order itself may run into legal constraints, Trump's public broadsides against social media platforms could give added momentum to multiple efforts from lawmakers to tweak Section 230 and make the platforms more accountable.</p><p>Regulators also continue to scrutinize the broader power that Big Tech wields. Facebook and Google are facing antitrust investigations from several authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and attorneys general of several states, which are expected to move forward this summer. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who previously was said to be in regular contact with the White House during the pandemic, has more recently been called on to testify before Congress about his company's alleged misuse of data. </p><p>In fact, the health crisis could end up giving additional public momentum to efforts to rein in the tech industry, despite --- or even because of --- how vital it has proven during the pandemic. </p><p>\"I think what we are seeing as a result of the crisis is that more and more people are depending on these platforms, which just highlights how powerful they are,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"I think people are noticing in more areas of their life, that there are very few legal protections that people and companies have for their interactions with these platforms.\" </p><p>If all that wasn't enough, the ongoing national conversation around race, sparked by mass protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody last month, could prove to be another source of scrutiny for the tech industry. Silicon Valley has long been criticized for not being diverse enough and for building tools that can enable discriminatory practices. Protestors are also reportedly calling out Facebook for funding a police department and urging companies to stop advertising on the platform.</p><p>Zuckerberg sought to address some of the backlash in a lengthy note to employees last week, promising a broad review of several Facebook policies and initiatives to increase the \"representation of diversity, inclusion and human rights\" and \"advance racial justice.\" </p><p>\"To members of our Black community: I stand with you. Your lives matter. Black lives matter,\" he said. He stopped short of committing to concrete change, however, saying the company \"may not come up with changes we want to make\" in all the areas being reviewed. Several people and groups criticized Zuckerberg's statement for not doing enough, days after prominent civil rights organizations said they were \"disappointed\" by a conversation with the Facebook CEO about Trump's posts. </p><p>As the techlash returns with a vengeance, Zuckerberg and his peers may face a long, tense year ahead.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

And to ensure fairness and impartiality, we have gathered together the great and the good in the industry to form our independent judging panel - thanks to all the judges for their gallant efforts this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2019, industry players - banks, consultancies and technology providers - tendered entries from across the globe, showcasing the strategic innovation happening in banks ranging from Mongolia to Ecuador, Poland to Botswana; thus, the winners are similarly geographically dispersed. The awards judging process takes into consideration the local operating environment and applauds technology solutions that have made a significant impact in a domestic market. It is not always a case of biggest is best, as proven by the fintech disruptors in many markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the global players are not resting on their laurels and have been clearly mobilising investments, resources and people to drive forward their technology strategies. As such, it comes as no surprise that the digital transformation category once again received the highest number of entries. Banks across the world are working hard to modernise all aspects of their business, driving paper and manual intervention out of every process and improving customer experience through better use of data.</p><p>The digital transformation winner in 2019, Banco de Bogot\u00e1, started off with a pilot project to see how fast it could build a new website and uncovered the vast transformative potential that moving to cloud and application programming interfaces (APIs) could unleash for its retail business. The Colombian bank reports a significant growth in the digital channel's activity rate, an increase in website transactions and an improvement in the website's net promoter score.</p><p>Yet again the mobile category received the second highest number of submissions and double the number of entries in 2018. The projects show a maturation of the mobile channel, with many showcasing functionality well beyond simple account services. The focus is on enabling the customer's lifestyle from their mobile device, whether that is providing digital concierge or financial planning guidance, or enabling foreign exchange trading, mortgage applications and investment allocation. Most projects had elements of biometrics - facial and/or fingerprints - embedded in the mobile app to guarantee security as well as frictionless customer experience.</p><p>Both APIs and distributed ledger technology (DLT) categories received double the number of entries than in 2018, which illustrates the growing importance of both in the technology stack of banks. While APIs have been given a boost by regulations such as the EU's Payment Services Directive 2, in other jurisdictions the direction of travel towards open banking is clear - and banks are taking advantage of the innovation ecosystem that becomes possible with open APIs.</p><p>The DLT projects are also reaching higher level of maturity and the solutions coming to market are making real gains efficiency and capabilities. Twice the number of entries were submitted in 2018, which also saw a doubling of entries over 2017 - and this trend is likely to continue.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the fintech partnership category - first added in 2018 - saw increase in entries, illustrating the growing role start-ups are playing in helping banks along their digital transformation journey.</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners 2019.</p><p>THE JUDGES Dr Louise Beaumont, advisor and angel investor Oliver Bussmann, Bussmann Advisory Stuart Chalmers, Accenture Jost Hoppermann, Forrester Research Elizabeth Lumley, VC Innovations and FinTECHTalents Joy Macknight, The Banker Virginie O'Shea, Aite Group Tim Roberts, AlixPartners David Williams, EY GLOBAL, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS WINNER: DBS GROUP TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS Project name: A Small Bot for Banking; a Giant Innovation for a Better World DBS has long exhibited its prowess in The Banker's Tech Projects Awards, however 2019 is a standout year by anyone's standards. The Singapore banking group was among the top three contenders in almost half the awards categories, a feat that scooped it the global accolade for 2019.</p><p>While it gave other entrants a run for their money in several categories including cyber security, data and payments, it was in the highly coveted artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics category where DBS triumphed with its 'A Small Bot for Banking; a Giant Innovation for a Better World' project. Its winning entry includes two projects: a corporate banking virtual assistant called 'Joy' for the institutional banking group; and Quantum Image Recognition Application (QIRA) deployed in the consumer banking group to power its call centre.</p><p>DBS is using AI and intelligent process automation (IPA) to develop a hyper-personalised strategy, delivering differentiated customer experiences by applying data insights to decision making, and improving operational efficiency. In addition to robotic process automation (RPA), the bank reaps additional benefits from automation by leveraging AI to enhance IPA, through natural language processing and machine learning.</p><p>Joy is an AI-enabled chatbot equipped with features such as quick reply, dynamic frequently asked questions and guided conversation, which help improve accuracy, increase learning speed and consistency to build trust and reduce friction in communication with corporate customers. Leveraging AI, data-driven analytics and machine learning, the bank can provide more relevant content, as well as product and service information. Following the pilot's success in Singapore, the servicing platform was rolled out in all six DBS core markets in 2018.</p><p>QIRA is a workforce command centre bot, developed in house by the workforce management (WM) team in the call centre. It uses RPA to transform the current command centre model by embedding digitalisation and automation, to improve real-time resource optimisation, thereby creating better employee and customer experience. The WM team is now focused on more value-added tasks, such as analysing real-time trends and providing insights to stakeholders.</p><p>The project originated from a few avid gamers in the WM team applying the use of bots in gaming (to automate character levelling up tasks) to manage real-time demands and distribute calls and workload efficiently. QIRA is a testament to the bank's start-up culture where people are self-empowered to develop new solutions.</p><p>\"As Joy transforms to become the chatbot of choice with soul and empathy for customers' banking services and financial needs, with a focus on sustainability, QIRA is also leading the way to a future-ready digital workforce,\" says Kelly Lau, executive director, regional strategic planning and support, at DBS.</p><p>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES WINNER: SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 G\u00c9N\u00c9RALE Project name: SG Markets Developer Portal Application programming interfaces (APIs) continue to be at the heart of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's (SG's) digital transformation strategy. The French bank started early and in 2014 launched its 'API Manifesto' and developed a security interface called SG Connect, available across the wholesale division.</p><p>In 2017, the bank built a single repository - the API catalogue - to gather its APIs with the same representational state transfer standard. After being enriched by thousands of users' feedback, in early 2019 it was relaunched as SG Markets Developer Portal, designed as a full developer ecosystem to \"code the bank\" and the reason SG took home the API award this year. It was a hotly contested category in 2019, with more than double the number of submissions in 2018.</p><p>\"Thanks to SG Markets Developer, we have accelerated our API developments, visibility and re-use,\" says Alain Fischer, chief digital officer, global banking and investor solutions, at SG. \"APIs are more than ever the backbone of our digital transformation. They foster information system simplification and innovation. Each brick of our information system is now an asset - unique, reliable and performant - that can be endlessly re-used, creating more and more value. This project enables all our staff to browse, test and use SG business-to-business services in a single place through catalogues of APIs, widgets and data.\"</p><p>SG Markets Developer Portal is publicly open for client-facing APIs. Internally, it gathers more than 3800 APIs (including more than 1800 already in production), multiple types of products (widgets, datasets), as well as the documentation and self-service features. Over the course of 2018, SG's APIs received 30 million calls by external clients.</p><p>The portal is a one-stop shop for developers and is used by a wide range of partners, such as business sponsors, users, IT architects and so on. Unleashing access to the bank's data, there are now 377 companies that have connected their systems and applications to SG Markets Analytics APIs.</p><p>SG believes that its API project has transformative potential in two ways. First, for external clients and businesses, it enables the integration of data directly into the client's information ecosystem, as such the information can be directly treated/analysed to fulfil the client's need. Second, it fosters innovation both externally and internally. It can also be applied to a wider market, not only the banking industry.</p><p>COMPLIANCE WINNER: HSBC BANK Project name: Global Social Network Analytics Partners: Quantexa HSBC has scooped the compliance award for the second year running, further underscoring the importance the UK bank places on regulatory compliance. In both years, the bank has teamed up with fintech start-ups to deliver innovative solutions for tackling financial crime.</p><p>For an international bank with HSBC's scale, it is a huge task to find signs of potential financial crime. Each month the bank screens more than 658 million transactions across 207 million accounts for signs of money laundering and other financial crime. One of the key challenges in detecting financial crime is establishing where people or entities are acting together to move money around the globe. Working with an enterprise intelligence fintech, Quantexa, HSBC has developed its Global Social Network Analytics (GSNA) technology platform, which combines bank data and external data, such as company ownership information, to identify links between customers or transactions and map out net-works. The platform provides bank investigators with an enhanced ability to analyse customer activities and relationships to better identify potential financial crime.</p><p>As Michael Shearer, global head of product management, financial crime threat mitigation, compliance, at HSBC, says: \"Our goal was to develop a tool to help us tackle financial crime. GSNA has achieved this by enabling our investigators to analyse links between customers, transactions and external data. By revealing networks and adding context our investigations are deeper and, potentially, much faster.\"</p><p>GSNA uses more than 40 billion data points to construct its diagrams of networks and references over 30 billion financial transactions. The platform uses several open source technologies such as Scala, Spark and Elastic Search and combines these technologies with Quantexa's entity resolution and network generation to continually assess customer activities and provide a risk score.</p><p>In addition, the open architecture used in GSNA means that HSBC can integrate multiple technologies and data applications into the platform. This enables the bank to make use of the latest big data frameworks to reach new levels of performance.</p><p>\"GSNA has given us unprecedented insight into global financial networks,\" says Mr Shearer. \"We are building on that foundation to further enhance our monitoring capabilities and focus our financial crime investigators on behaviour of greatest concern. We continue to expand the breadth and depth of data to improve the accuracy and coverage of this industry-leading capability.\"</p><p>CYBER SECURITY WINNER: YES BANK Project name: Corporate Net Banking - I-AM and I-AM FED Having robust security procedures in corporate internet banking to minimise the possibilities of fraudulent transactions is of paramount importance to Yes Bank. The Indian bank believes that ensuring customer data security, trust and privacy will soon be the determining factor in every digital relationship, and aims to enable digital trust in a frictionless and seamless manner.</p><p>With this in mind, Yes Bank - in collaboration with global cyber security research firm 42 Labs - has developed an identity and access management solution called I-AM, which has the capability to provide real-time cryptographic digital transaction signing on a massive scale for its corporate clients. The bank's pioneering approach clinched it the cyber security award in 2019.</p><p>I-AM aggregates three different factors to provide an identity trust score: the user's identities, such as their mobile number; government-issued identities, such as Aadhaar and passport number; and bank-issued identities, such as their account number.</p><p>The bank's I-AM platform helps individual entities (user and enterprise) to authenticate and prove identities in the digital world to securely communicate, access and share information and services. It has public key infrastructure-grade cryptographic strength, with a dynamic crypto generation capability each time, eliminating the need for one-time passwords and tokenbased authentication.</p><p>It makes use of crypto-identity technology, which tightly integrates and cryptographically links the customer's digital identity attributes to every transaction. It not only ensures that the transaction is electronically signed, but also that it is end-toend secure, and that only the intended recipient - the bank - will be able to process it. It protects the customers from sophisticated cyber attacks, such as phishing and man-in-the-middle, while ensuring that the corporate customer digital experience is seamless and frictionless.</p><p>Users can download the mobile app from Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The bank has been successful in rolling out its I-AM-based transaction signing method across more than 500 corporate clients and over 1200 users in these corporate entities.</p><p>Additionally, Yes Bank has extended I-AM-based authentication for file transfers and encryption which will further secure digital transactions of the bank's customers. I-AM File Encryption Decryption (I-AM FED) is a new service by the bank, which is useful to encrypt the file at the corporate client's end and decrypt the file at the bank's end.</p><p>DATA WINNER: TAISHIN INTERNATIONAL BANK Project name: Hybrid Data - the Artificial Intelligence Applications of Audio and Digital Footprint Data Partners: Google, CloudMile, Grandsys Picking up the accolade for best data project in 2019, Taishin International Bank (Taishin) has cleverly integrated traditional financial transaction data and customer activity data to establish an overall profile for its customers. Through its project 'Hybrid Data - the Artificial Intelligence Applications of Audio and Digital Footprint Data', the Taiwanese bank was also able to reform its corporate culture by introducing new technologies and redesigning procedures to achieve integration of multiform data.</p><p>\"Traditional, static, structured customer data have reached limits on enhancing customer engagement,\" says Christy Shyy, head of the segmentation division at Taishin. \"By integrating data from devices, inbound calls, networks, applications and web portals and so on, we could more realistically understand the whole customer life experience and customer journey in financial services.</p><p>\"We leveraged advanced big data analytic techniques, including text analytics, machine learning, data mining and natural language processing, to create the hybrid data, which glean important customer insights from previously untapped data sources and existing transactional data, and to support customers' critical life transitions.\"</p><p>The strategic key of this project was to look at how hybrid data establishes links between each step in the customer journey. Taishin introduced speech-to-text technology, as well as integrated customers' footprints and design data models, which help in connecting heterogeneous data formats.</p><p>The bank used the data to build prediction models, then launched real-time marketing and retargeting campaigns. As a result, it saw a 60% increase in response rate, a 50% rise in online applications, and the success rate in opening a digital account increased from 40% to 80%. From the bank's perspective, a sound data integration framework saves on overhead during analysis. Customers' preferences are captured based on more comprehensive data and suitable products or services are provided accordingly; they are no longer limited to a single product, a single channel or a single customer base.</p><p>\"The customer interaction experience is becoming more scattered across a plethora of devices and channels, thus we need to adapt efficiently to the customer's changing expectations at different contact points. Through hybrid data innovation, we seek to improve our understanding and empathising capabilities with our customers,\" says Ms Shyy.</p><p>DELIVERY CHANNELS WINNER: CAIXABANK Project name: Facial Recognition at CaixaBank ATMs Partners: Fujitsu, FacePhi CaixaBank Digital Business's recent research into the pain points in the ATM customer journey found that the main frustration was the friction involved in using and memorising multiple passwords. Overall, customers were looking for security, simplicity and speed when interacting with an ATM.</p><p>In response to these findings, the Spanish bank saw an opportunity to use biometrics to improve the customer journey and in just eight months began rolling out the ability for clients to withdraw money with their face. Facial recognition proved to be a solution for a more secure, faster and frictionless interaction with the ATM, and more than 70% of CaixaBank clients from all ages were willing to swap the PIN for facial recognition at the ATM.</p><p>The registration process is done in CaixaBank 'store' branches, which are larger branches designed to offer higher valueadded services. The process, which entails registering the client's biometric coordi-nates, takes less than one minute. Once the registration is done, the client can immediately withdraw money from the ATM without the need of using their PIN.</p><p>The project was developed in six months, using agile and design-thinking methodologies. With a multidisciplinary CaixaBank team working with technology partners, Fujitsu and FacePhi, the bank designed and tested the solution with its customers to deploy the best and latest technology to satisfy their needs.</p><p>Three months after a limited roll out, more than 1300 clients have registered for the service, with an average of two withdrawals per month using facial recognition. The average withdrawal time was reduced by 5%, which also means a reduction in queues and an increase in customer satisfaction.</p><p>According to the bank, the project is a big step towards the future of customer identification and a key element in the security and digital customer experience of financial services. Additionally, the use of facial recognition in CaixaBank ATMs opens a new world of business opportunities, which will improve customer lives, optimise internal processes and increase revenues for the entity.</p><p>Benjam\u00ed Puigdevall, general manager at CaixaBank Digital Business, says: \"This project has positioned CaixaBank as a pioneer to offer its customers the ability to use facial recognition to withdraw cash from ATMs, without having to enter their PIN, offering its customers a unique and frictionless experience.\"</p><p>DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION WINNER: BANCO DE BOGOT\u00c1 Project name: New Online Banking Partners: Grupo Aval, ATH, McKinsey, Amazon, Mareigua, Transunion Scooping the most sought-after award in 2019 is Banco de Bogot\u00e1's New Online Banking project. It was born as a pilot initiative to measure its capacity to build a new website in a short time and with high cost-efficiency levels. It was implemented using cloud-native technologies that allow rapid integration with application programming interfaces (APIs) and connections with the bank's core system.</p><p>Julio Rojas Sarmiento, chief financial officer at Banco de Bogot\u00e1, says: \"Our New Online Banking project is changing the way in which Banco de Bogot\u00e1 interacts with its customers. We have made digital transactions easier, leading them to carry out more advanced operations, thereby impacting their digital financial self-management.\"</p><p>The bank developed a concept called 'shortcuts', which aims to gradually help clients increase their digital financial skills by highlighting popular transactions. It created a simple dashboard, with direct access buttons to the most relevant actions such as credit card, energy bill and mobile phone payments, or money transfers to family members or friends.</p><p>While working on the shortcut concept, the bank also looked to create natural experiences for mobile device users by leveraging the information of their social network' interactions and the characteristics of the most popular apps. The objective is for users to feel that exploring an invoice is like exploring Instagram or Facebook stories, or that registering for a utility payment is the same as an online check-in, according to the bank.</p><p>The new website is built with standard technologies, which allows Banco de Bogot\u00e1 to work at the time-to-market speed required to compete in the digital revolution that financial systems are experiencing. Effectively, the bank is building an open banking platform that allows it to quickly and easily integrate with other banks, new players and the entire financial ecosystem through APIs.</p><p>Open banking provides the bank with access to new relevant data, which provides the insight needed to develop new products and services, and also permits Banco de Bogot\u00e1 to facilitate its bank-as-aservice platform, helping the rapid developsource ment of the financial ecosystem.</p><p>The bank reports a substantial increase in digital transactions, from 56.5% in 2017 to 73.5% in 2018, and an improvement in the website's net promoter score to more than 80. \"[It] is leading Banco de Bogot\u00e1 to be perceived as a digital bank,\" says Mr Rojas Sarmiento.</p><p>DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY WINNER: BBVA Project name: BBVA Blockchain Platform Partners: Comunytek, Everis The number of entries in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) category more than doubled this year, highlighting the increasing maturity of projects across the banking industry. BBVA's blockchain platform, an innovative project that improves efficiency throughout the negotiation process between the Spanish bank and its customers to solve their financing needs, picks up the accolade in 2019.</p><p>The platform covers the whole origination process, including tracking the negotiations ahead of signing the contract. It uses a private DLT, Hyperledger, deployed between the bank and the customer, in which steps and data integral to the negotiation process are recorded, thereby guaranteeing traceability.</p><p>When the deal is digitally signed through the DLT platform, then it generates a hash for the contract and is recorded in the public blockchain Ethereum, effectively a timestamped record in a public registry. The immutability of the agreement is ensured, as no amendment can be made to the hash.</p><p>The project has changed the way corporate clients interact with BBVA for their financing needs. With a transparent process implemented in a smart contract, the client is guaranteed that the process is fair and that all the information about the process is stored in an immutable ledger. Clients are encouraged to host their own blockchain nodes and are then given the complete code to install their nodes. In addition, the bank is building a do-it-yourself portal with all communications flowing through the system.</p><p>Importantly - and what clinched the award - BBVA listed several financial instruments it closed using DLT, including bilateral loans, syndicated loans and structured bonds, with deals ranging from (EURO)35m to (EURO)1bn.</p><p>\"Blockchain is a useful technology because its features of real time, traceability and transparency are instrumental to creating smart interactions and front-to-back automation. We believe blockchain technology is a long-term play, creating faster, easier and safer ways to share data and pieces of data modularly,\" says Ricardo Laiseca, head of innovation and data analysis at BBVA Corporate and Investment Banking.</p><p>BBVA's project has the potential to bring efficiency to the industry. For example, syndicated loans are characterised for having a group of banks arranging complex agreements with manual and inefficient processes that also incorporate external legal counsels. To transform this market, a blockchain platform would need to be adopted as the marketplace through which banks and clients get in contact and negotiate financing terms.</p><p>FINTECH PARTNERSHIP WINNER: EZBOB Project name: Smarter Onboarding in Unsecured SME Lending Parties involved: RBS/Esme Loans Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), hailed as the engine of economic growth, have long been underserved by the banking industry, particularly in areas such as financing. But now digital challengers are stepping in to give the sector the attention it warrants.</p><p>Ezbob, a UK fintech founded in 2011 as an online lending platform, is one such new entrant and has picked up the award for best fintech partnership for its work with Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS's) SME lending arm, Esme Loans. The fintech provides an open platform that enables Esme to build, launch and operate financial products for its customers, drawing on the data available in the UK's Open Banking environment.</p><p>In April 2019, Ezbob's Smart Onboarding Engine went live at Esme. \"The Smart Onboarding Engine simplifies SME loan applications. It cuts loan servicing costs accrued by Esme and Ezbob's other clients, such as American Express and CYBG, by up to 80% while allowing their SME customers to receive a lending decision in just seven minutes. It has enabled Esme and our other clients to lend to SMEs faster, more cost effectively and with improved credit data insights,\" says Tomer Guriel, founder and CEO of Ezbob.</p><p>The platform allows for the speedy development of new products and services, but also includes innovative solutions for simple deployment, operation and maintenance in dedicated or shared (multi-tenant) systems.</p><p>Ezbob has a suite of modular lending applications, including Catalyst+, a risk engine, activation engine and servicing engine. It aggregates information from more than 40 different service providers and presents better data that leads to better risk management. This includes the ability to provide loans based on non-traditional online data, such as Amazon, eBay or PayPal activity. It also features smart, real-time monitoring analytics that uncover customer journey optimisation opportunities to increase acquisition conversion metrics.</p><p>The fintech's solution also supports multiple products, including business loans, mortgages, and asset finance, which can be offered to different types of customer. This widens the scope from SMEs, allowing banks and financial institutions to transform their entire lending infrastructure, enabling improved customer experience, faster lending, automation, reduced cost per loan and increased profitability for all types of consumer product. Ezbob's ambition is to move into adjacent sectors. It is also exploring further partnerships with 'big tech' companies, for example, as they move into the financial services space.</p><p>MOBILE WINNER: VTB BANK Project name: My Smart City Mobile App Parties involved: Government of Moscow, Intervale, Ampersand VTB Bank has taken the mobile app concept to the next level. The Russian bank's My Smart City mobile app combines informational and financial services that are needed for everyday city life, which had not been brought together in a single application until now.</p><p>\"We have designed this app with the interests and needs of modern urbanites in mind,\" says Vadim Izotov, head of special electronic products division, global transaction banking, at VTB Bank. Through their smartphone, the customer can access necessary information and easily get on with their daily business - in just one click.</p><p>The free app changes in accordance with the user's current location and habits. It was initially launched for Moscow, in association with the municipal government, and supports an ongoing programme to develop Moscow as an innovative, modern, highly technological city of the future.</p><p>The My Smart City app collects data on urbanites' needs, habits, interests, spending and location (in strict accordance with the current Russian legislation on personal data and confidential information). It then transfers the data to the municipal government, state departments and service providers, which analyse the data to help drive changes in organisational functions, making services more convenient and efficient.</p><p>VTB Bank wants to help urbanites to complete smoothly their daily tasks easily with the minimum amount of effort and time - and at a minimum cost. The app provides users with a comprehensive payment solution by involving local government departments and service providers in one app. For example, users can purchase tickets for cultural events, top up their Troyka transport card, pay for parking, utility bills and school meals, as well as access the best offers and deals in the district.</p><p>State departments and service providers benefit from new sales channels, having a new platform for publishing information for better targeting audiences, and a trustworthy and fast payment system. VTB benefits from the socially oriented large-scale project in association with the Moscow government through increasing the number and volume of transactions and new customers. Both ben-efit from the big data aspect of the project.</p><p>An Android version will be released in September 2019 and a second release for St Petersburg is currently under development. \"We will continue to expand the capabilities of the app and plan to launch My Smart City across other big cities in Russia,\" says Mr Izotov.</p><p>PAYMENTS WINNER: STANDARD BANK Project name: Standard Bank Virtual Card Parties involved: Tutuka, Mastercard, Uber, Takealot, Zando, Admyt, Travelstart Globally e-commerce is exploding, but South African online spend is lagging despite the best efforts of prominent retailers and a modern card infrastructure. Lack of trust, convenience and flexibility are still hindering e-commerce spend, with just 2% of total South African retail spend done online.</p><p>To address this challenge, Standard Bank launched its virtual card project to bring innovation to the way all South Africans can join and participate in the local and global online shopping experience. It allows customers to create, load and use prepaid virtual cards online, in real-time, and with unparalleled safety and control.</p><p>The goals of the project were to create a product that was customer-led, had no eligibility criteria, no credit-worthiness requirement, was free to customers and allowed customers to transact in real time. The South African bank has worked closely with e-commerce partners, including Takealot, Uber, Travelstart and Zando, to develop the virtual card ecosystem, and it is starting to attract early adopters from across its customer base.</p><p>Standard Bank virtual cards are prepaid reloadable cards, issued in real time in the bank's mobile banking app, that can be instantly loaded from any account and utilised anywhere on the internet and mobile apps. Customers can create multiple cards, generic for unlimited shopping or cards cobranded with leading South African online retailers for unique incentives and flexibility.</p><p>It is an innovative implementation of the virtual card concept, allowing real-time creation, real-time load from multiple account types, and co-branding with the biggest names in South African e-commerce. It offers online retailers a 'secure virtual mall' inside one of the biggest African banks' mobile app, to showcase their brand and incentives without any technical interfacing work.</p><p>Gwena\u00ebl Trotel, head of consumer solutions at Standard Bank, says: \"With virtual cards, all our [retail] customers can now shop online with unrivalled safety and convenience, particularly those who used to be concerned about using their physical cards detail on the internet.

With its new credit management system, called Enterprise Financial Status Prediction (EFSP), it can do it in real time, which clinched it the risk management award for 2019.</p><p>The EFSP system, developed jointly with JSOL Corporation, can detect changes in the business conditions of a transacting corporate client at an earlier stage based on dynamic data relating to the corporate client's account and by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to capture complex interactions of multiple factors that a person was unable to perceive previously.</p><p>Detection of such changes can now happen up to 15 months before the settled financial statements are released, which means that SMBC can provide business support proposals to its corporate clients in a timely manner. Additionally, the bank is able to avoid additional credit costs associated with a client facing future deterioration of business conditions. This could potentially reduce the bank's provisioning for loan losses.</p><p>The Japanese bank and JSOL began developing the EFSP system in 2016 and continually tweaked it until it was ready to be used in the bank's credit management operations. In February 2019, the partners started providing the system as a cloud service to external companies, mainly financial institutions, on OpenCanvas, which is a cloud platform for financial institutions run by NTT Data.</p><p>In terms of its transformative impact, SMBC believes that banks ranging from large to small regional banks or financial institutions, such as credit co-operatives, will be the main beneficiaries, as they will be able to generate a credit risk score from the analysis of account-related information concerning their own corporate clients.</p><p>In addition, SMBC is receiving requests from some large business enterprises that would like to use the system. Global enterprises cannot capture business conditions of their overseas subsidiaries in a timely way, which is a serious problem for them. With the EFSP system, global enterprises can use the judgement scores and gain visibility over movements in the accounts of their overseas subsidiaries.</p><p>SMBC is considering further improving the accuracy of the system through using macroeconomic news and information in the supply chain in addition to account information. It is also considering developing a growth forecast model or a credit assessment model for start-ups.</p><p>SOCIAL MEDIA WINNER: ALFA-BANK BELARUS Project name: InSync Now In the past year, Alfa-Bank Belarus has doubled its number of mobile banking clients, its number of online transactions and its share of online deposits and loans portfolio. Achieving such results would require much more effort were it not for the trust the Belarusian bank has built upon regular positive interaction through InSync Now, an innovative communication tool within the bank's social media strategy.</p><p>InSync Now, a micro-media outlet inside Alfa-Bank Belarus's mobile banking app, InSync, creates a new way of interacting with mobile banking users, who are the most active customers of the bank. It is also a new way of managing social media content, and is an example of social banking.</p><p>Launched in September 2018, the initial stage of InSync Now included a newsfeed and 'like' buttons. The next update included hashtags that helped users find related articles. A more recent innovation is a 'red dot' indicating that a section has been updated with new publications worth reading.</p><p>The Alfa-Bank Belarus team was inspired by the Today section in Apple's App Store and by big tech's understanding of customer experience related to various apps, such as Instagram and Facebook. Clients are now used to scrolling through interesting and well-designed brief posts, so the team realised that the bank could harness this form of communication to appeal more directly to its users. The solution is unique in the Belarusian market, as no other bank uses such an approach in mobile banking.</p><p>Olga Filipenko, head of mobile business at Alfa-Bank Belarus, says: \"The decision to launch InSync Now relates to the philosophy of Alfa-Bank Belarus: appeal to the clients, be closer to them and trigger positive emotions. This project aimed at 'humanising' the bank, making it helpful, easy to understand, and near and dear to the customers. The main reason why InSync Now is so greatly valued by customers is that it serves as a bridge to the bank's team and a source of inspiration, interesting insights and useful tips.\"</p><p>Over the course of five months, InSync Now reached the top three of Alfa-Bank Belarus's communication channels, only trailing behind Twitter and Instagram accounts. The bank publishes five posts each week in the special section, each of them getting between 5000 and 8000 views on average, and 100 to 1000 'likes'. The InSync mobile banking audience consists of 230,000 clients, with daily in-app traffic of up to 80,000 visitors.</p><p>TRADING SYSTEMS WINNER: CREDIT SUISSE Project name: EMEA Advanced Execution Services Enhanced Adaptive Framework Competition between brokers in the algorithmic trading space has never been greater and innovation is key to stay ahead of the pack. The implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II further highlighted the link between better trading performance and broker selection and, ultimately, the success of a trading platform. To differentiate itself in such a competitive space - and scoop the award for best trading system project - Credit Suisse has incorporated machine learning technology in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) equities trading through its suite of agency algorithmic trading strategies, called advanced execution services (AES). The machine learning project delivers best execution to clients by more optimally selecting between different strategy variants and parameters compared with traditional approaches.</p><p>The AES platform provides performance improvements against various execution quality benchmarks by helping define these selections in a more data-driven and dynamic fashion - for example, resulting in a more than 30% improvement versus volume weighted average price benchmark. Continually learning from new data and outcomes to improve these selections generates outperformance compared with the standard approach of relying on pre-defined rule sets, periodic or ad-hoc reviews, and/or manual selections.</p><p>Live since mid-2018, the machine learning platform is the result of collaboration between the bank's AES quant and technology teams. The combined partnership enabled the bank to harness the necessary technology infrastructure with quantitative analysis to move beyond theoretical concepts to deliver a live set-up for clients within a strong and compliant framework.</p><p>The machine learning framework transforms how Credit Suisse selects more optimal trading strategies. It makes quicker and more intelligent analysis and informed decision making much more feasible across a wide set of data, clients and types of flow. It provides a much stronger data-driven framework to support and automatically update these decisions on an ongoing basis, and allows for more tailored selection of strategies and strategy variants for specific types of flow.</p><p>\"This platform was designed with one goal in mind: to deliver better results to our clients,\" says Jonathan Tse, head of EMEA advanced execution services product at Credit Suisse. \"We have taken the time to build the right teams and technology infrastructure to be able to truly leverage quantitative research and machine learning from theory into reality; driving better and more targeted strategies for our clients on an order-by-order basis.\"</p><p>IN 2019, INDUSTRY PLAYERS TENDERED ENTRIES FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE, FROM MONGOLIA TO ECUADOR, POLAND TO BOTSWANA</p><p>APIS ARE MORE THAN EVER THE BACKBONE OF OUR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION Alain Fischer</p><p>GSNA HAS GIVEN US UNPRECEDENTED INSIGHT INTO GLOBAL FINANCIAL NETWORKS.

PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE MEASURES NEEDED TO BOOST PROFITABILITY AND PROTECT MARGINS IN THE BELOW zero interest rate environment and the case for regionwide and in-market consolidation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pressing need to upgrade legacy infrastructure and scale down costly branch networks remains, as banks continue to reduce costs, transition to digital business models and defend their market share from emerging fintech and neobank challengers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Basel III/IV, customer due diligence and the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) top the regulatory agenda, while the prospects for a regulatory framework around climate risk may become the focus for European governments and regulators during 2020.</p><p>The panel also considered the credibility of the threat from 'Big Tech' firms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google. Large technology groups such as Ant Financial, Alibaba and Tencent are beating banks' retail offerings in China, delivering enhanced customer experiences, and their appetite to push deeper into finance is being seen in other parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Whether Big Tech has the desire to make inroads as competitors into a highly regulated European market with deep conventional banking penetration is something the panel considered.</p><p>Chira Barua: With capital levels broadly restored and marginal efficiency gains from cost reductions losing steam, the single largest challenge for the banking system in Europe is the search for elusive revenue growth, especially given anaemic returns at less than 5% return on equity. Monetary policy doesn't really help, nor does muted credit demand across most geographies. Banks need to head back to the whiteboard to identify where they specifically add actual value for their customers in the retail and institutional space, and find ways to monetise it, be it through optimal pricing decisions based on deep segmentation or through the introduction of more valueadded ecosystem plays.</p><p>Teunis Brosens: The European banking sector clearly has a profitability problem. The year 2020 will see continued activity by challengers expanding into banking, forcing banks to maintain substantive investments in transitioning to a digital business model. The more acute challenge for 2020 is the \u00a6 WHAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING EUROPEAN BANKS IN 2020? negative interest rate environment. Negative rates have been eroding bank profitability since their inception in 2014. Mitigating management actions have limited the impact so far, but room for such actions is rapidly running out. With banks reluctant to impose negative rates on households, interest margins will come under increasing pressure. In addition, the average rate banks earn on their loan portfolios keeps on declining too.</p><p>Alastair Ryan: Negative rates: for a bank, what an awful idea they were. Banks raise deposits from people and businesses, basically at zero. The deposits are very stable, because there are millions of depositors, so you can use them for long-term financing. It is a model that's been taken up pretty much everywhere, for centuries. But it is only any good if zero is a better cost of funding than just borrowing it in the wholesale market. Negative rates mean it is a worse cost of funding, so banks don't work.</p><p>Huw van Steenis: Like steroids, unconventional policy can be highly effective in small dosages, but just as the long-term usage of steroids can weaken bones, so can belowzero rates weaken the financial system. So now, negative rates are creating challenges for banks, insurers and pension funds. But banks need to play the cards they are dealt. This means driving scale on platforms to offset low rates, margin compression and technology investments will be an enduring theme. For most banks, this will involve fighting it out for market share and adding adjacent services through platforms. But don't rule out some banks looking to deals to drive scale, especially if the environment were to deteriorate.</p><p>Sam Theodore: The elephant in the room is the stubbornly high 'analogue' excess capacity [of the European banking sector] - not Basel IV, not the European Central Bank's negative rates and not the lack of pan-European deposit insurance. Mobile-embracing customer behaviour and competition from fintechs and Big Tech, spurred on by open banking regulations, make banks' massive legacy infrastructures - branches and back offices - both costly and unnecessary. There is no way back on this path and banks will be increasingly forced to switch from walking to running on it.</p><p>With revenues under ongoing negative pressure, banks will no longer be able to keep kicking the excess capacity can down the road. More substantial legacy cutting will have to take place: fewer banks, fewer branches and smaller back offices. There were approximately 174,000 bank branches across the EU (including the UK) in 2018. It is likely that by the end of 2020 that number will fall to between 140,000 and 145,000, with more drastic cuts afterwards.</p><p>\u00a6 DO YOU EXPECT CONSOLIDATION AMONG EUROPEAN BANKS TO INCREASE IN 2020? WILL THIS BE DOMESTIC OR CROSS-BORDER? WHAT WILL BE THE DRIVERS? Mr Barua: There is definitely a case for consolidation among European banks given the struggle with low returns on one hand and the case for scale economics on the other. Increasing demands on investments in technology enhances the case for scale. Six-thousand banks is a bit too many for the continent, especially for an industry labelled as a utility now. Conditions are also ripe for mergers and acquisitions, given the broad dispersion of capital, economics and valuation between banks. Having said that, crossborder consolidation would need to be catalysed through fundamental changes in the regulatory landscape, especially with regards to deposit fungibility.</p><p>Mr Brosens: An important way to deal with declining interest income is cost reduction. Taking advantage of economies of scale is an obvious way to trim costs, especially as markets are turning digital. Given that Europe's banking markets are already overcrowded, consolidation is one of the few options available to increase scale for individual banks. Domestic consolidation is ongoing, but cross-border consolidation continues to be difficult because a single European banking market still does not exist. Regulations and their application differ per country, and countries continue to impose local capital and liquidity constraints. This makes it more difficult to run a European bank as a truly single, consolidated entity.</p><p>Mr Ryan: You need banking union for cross-border consolidation. There is no point consolidating parent companies unless you can merge the balance sheets. Today you can't, so being bigger doesn't bring scale benefits. In fact, under the Basel rules, you might well find your capital requirements rise, so it is value destructive. In-market deals are a problem, because most markets are internally consolidated, or have a lot of co-operative and state opera-THE ISSUES \u00a6 BANK CONSOLIDATION \u00a6 BASEL IV REGULATION \u00a6 FINTECH COMPETITION tors. The Netherlands doesn't need consolidation; Germany can't have it.</p><p>Mr Theodore: The main consolidation process likely to intensify in 2020 is inmarket among second-tier banks, mainly in Germany (within the co-operative and savings groups) and Italy. While the large banking groups have the capacity to meet digital challenges - some better than others - the smaller and less diversified banks do not. It is unrealistic to hope that, on its own, a branch-based traditional retail bank with a narrow range of products can remain economically viable by migrating to the digital ecosystem.</p><p>But in-market consolidation will inherently remain a painful process. Local social and political hurdles related to ownership, legal status, business missions and funding stand in the way of successful consolidation. There is also the issue of top management and board teams with a short-term vision on the future, unwilling to embark on a strategy that may not favour them personally during their tenure.</p><p>As for cross-border bank mergers, they don't look like a realistic route in the digital age. Large cross-border mergers, including in the euro area, would do more harm than good, unnecessarily postponing digital transformation while spending precious years on a forward-to-the-past integration process of the two legacy banks. While in the meantime these banks' competitors could jump the queue in the digital space through open banking-as-a-service platforms and partnerships.</p><p>\u00a6 WHAT IS THE BIGGEST REGULATORY ISSUE FACING EUROPEAN BANKS IN 2020? HOW SHOULD BANKS DEAL WITH IT? Mr Barua: Most banks in Europe are over the regulatory hump, especially with capital and liquidity levels significantly stronger since the lows of the global financial crisis. Having said that, there is still a long tail of regulations under Basel III (popularly known as Basel IV) that are still being introduced and are likely to be applied over the next few years. But the risks from these regulations have been well quantified and signposted; they're unlikely to be a shock to the system, especially given the ample lead time to their implementation.</p><p>Mr Brosens: The regulatory and supervisory framework for banks continues to evolve rapidly, just think of Basel 3.5, the implementation of the revised PSD2, the build-up of 'bail-inable' liabilities and the Interbank Offered Rate transition, to name a few. But what probably continues to be really top of mind at many banks is getting customer due diligence right. While it is clear that banks have more homework to do, a consensus is emerging that they can't do it alone. Closer co-operation with authorities and across borders is needed. The establishment of an anti-money laundering authority at EU level, alluded to by the European Council in December, would be a logical step forward.</p><p>Mr Ryan: We might just be seeing the end of the regulatory cycle. That is important, as without a stable rulebook you can't allocate capital. There are still banks, for example in Spain, with capital ratios that are low; or, of course, in Greece, where problem assets are still the thing. But it is finally stabilising.</p><p>Mr van Steenis: The year 2020 may be when the climate risk analysis of portfolios moves out of its niche and into the mainstream. Investors and boards have begun to realise that it can be more costly to ignore these issues than to try to grapple with them.</p><p>A flurry of central banks are introducing climate stress tests for banks and insurers, following the lead of Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The insights these tests provide could be used by boards and investors to change practices in asset allocation and risk management.</p><p>The scenarios and tools that are developed are likely to spread into the investment world too. Tests designed by Australian policy-makers, in fact, will explicitly cover pension funds, not just banks and insurers. Better metrics, which may become mandatory, investor activism and the growing realisation of large valuation dispersions will reinforce this.</p><p>Mr Theodore: The implementation of the EU's revised PSD2 will likely be the biggest regulatory challenge for banks in Europe. Prudential regulations, which have been piling up in the post-crisis decade, have forced the banks to adapt, but also have in a way protected the industry from nonbank competition.</p><p>On the contrary, PSD2 opens the gates to non-bank participants in financial services, such as fintechs and Big Tech (although the latter is more harshly scrutinised by regulators and policy-makers). Banks will be forced to set up open application programming interfaces with financial information for their clients (with the clients' prior agreement) and third party-providers, such as fintechs or even other banks that will be able to compete with their products for these clients.</p><p>Open banking is a new ecosystem for the banking industry, one with which many banks are plainly not comfortable. It is not at all evident that many European banks will be able to adjust to open banking. The main threat is for second-tier European banks outside the Nordic area, where all banks are digitally well advanced.</p><p>\u00a6 WHICH IS THE BIGGER THREAT TO EUROPEAN BANKS: COMPETITION FROM FINTECHS AND CHALLENGERS OR FROM BIG TECH? Mr Barua: As McKinsey wrote in its recent Global Banking Annual Review, banking is being clearly disrupted by both fintechs and Big Tech. Nowhere is the evidence clearer than in operating models, where neobanks operate at less than half the cost base of larger banks and with much better customer service. Most disruption has been seen around non-balance sheet-driven plays, such as payments and foreign exchange, and so on. The jury is still out on the appetite of Big Tech to participate in pools that are highly regulated and credit risk driven. Irrespective of where the threat comes from, it is all change in the way banks operate, as value gets transferred from the industry to the end customer aided by the role of technology.</p><p>Mr Brosens: Fintech start-ups are not only challengers, but also natural partners for banks. They tend to focus on doing one thing really well and outsourcing the rest. They also often lack a large client base, a well-known and trusted brand, and the funds to make the necessary investments to scale up. Partnering with banks can be beneficial for both parties. Technology giants do have well-known brands, a large client base and can outspend banks on research and development. They're more of a threat. At the same time, recent par tnership announcements show that Big Tech has - for now at least - no intention of acquiring banking licences. They'd rather outsource the difficult business of regulatory compliance to the experts: banks.</p><p>Mr Ryan: The real risk is regulatory arbitrage. It is expensive being a bank. If it is possible to have your customers consider you a bank, without you having to hold all the capital, liquidity and so on that a bank does, it'll be very profitable. I'd worry that, in the UK as an example, people think that 'current accounts' are bank accounts. Not any more they aren't: non-banks can offer them.</p><p>Mr van Steenis: The best way to look at any business is from the standpoint of the clients, as I tried to in the 'Leading the Future of Finance' report for the Bank of England. On the whole, the innovation and competition in payments, investments and banking is driving better value for clients. So, we should welcome this. But given the pace of change, firms should be somewhat paranoid and keep an open mind to be at the forefront of monetising data, improving the client offering and leveraging a modern toolkit anchored around machine learning, cloud and processing automation.</p><p>Mr Theodore: In fact, the main threat is the banks' own inability to adapt to the new digital ecosystem. Neither fintechs nor Big Tech are direct threats per se. Most fintechs are not profitable yet; they need to reach critical mass. The more they grow and diversify, the more supervisors will lean on them over prudential and conduct issues. Some neobanks will sprint ahead and eventually become profitable. But most of them will need to work closely with the incumbent banks and piggy-back onto their infrastuctures (for compliance, for example). Ideally, the fintech-to-bank relationship will be symbiotic, not adversarial.</p><p>As for technology giants, they're not interested in displacing incumbent banks and they don't wish to become regulated banks themselves. Closer relationships have started in the US (for example, between Amazon and Apple with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs). Similar developments could happen in Europe, although the regulatory acceptance of Big Tech in finance is likely to be more restrictive. Facebook's Libra is a case in point.</p><p>In general, banks are in a more solid position in Europe because of the higher degree of financial inclusion existing already - a very low percentage of unbanked or underbanked population - in contrast to regions such as Asia, Africa or Latin America - or even the US, where about 33 million households are unbanked or underbanked. The lower the level of financial inclusion by incumbent banks, the higher the likelihood that new players such as fintechs and Big Tech will make good market inroads into banks' territory.</p><p>TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE IS AN OBVIOUS WAY TO TRIM COSTS, ESPECIALLY AS MARKETS ARE TURNING DIGITAL Teunis Brosens</p><p>THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EU'S REVISED PSD2 WILL LIKELY BE THE BIGGEST REGULATORY CHALLENGE FOR BANKS IN EUROPE Sam Theodore</p><p>THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THE APPETITE OF BIG TECH TO PARTICIPATE IN POOLS THAT ARE HIGHLY REGULATED AND CREDIT RISK DRIVEN Chira Barua</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chira Barua Partner, McKinsey &amp;

However, disruption may also come from another source: big tech. Having already made their mark on countless industries, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple may now have their sights on the banking industry. A recent survey of 18 to 35 year olds conducted by MuleSoft said that 52% those people in the millennial bracket would consider using banking products from one of the GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) companies. With this in mind, Freddy Kelly, co-founder and CEO of credit bureau Credit Kudos believes that there is a threat of big tech \"coming in and eating the lunches of the banks and fintechs\". Big tech and big moneySpeaking at Fintech Week 2019, Kelly believes that the next few years could see GAFA companies having a significant impact on payments, lending, current accounts and insurance. </p><p>Big tech companies have already begun to embark on financial ventures, with payment platforms such as Google's Google Wallet and Google payments, Amazon lending to SME marketplace sellers, Facebook's partnership with Clear Bank on a product called Charged, a programme that allows financing for advertising, and Apple's credit card, launched last year with Goldman Sachs and Marcus in the US. However, no big tech company has been able to offer a complete financial ecosystem, with \"taking deposits and providing current accounts\" currently facing regulatory hurdles. But this may be about to change as big tech looks to further expand its operations. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was in talks with J.P. Morgan Chase to offer checking accounts. Bloomberg also reported that Google had been granted an eMoney license in Lithuania. In China, big tech encroachment on banking is already apparent, with Tencent launching WeBank back in 2015, and last year launching its own credit scoring system.\u00a0With the enticing opportunity of gaining even more insight into users' lives through their financial behaviors, the impact of Silicon Valley looks likely to play a key part in the future of banking. The data advantageBig tech is in the position of having a significant \"data advantage\" over banks or fintechs, with the ability to glean more information about their users than others could hope to achieve. With the tech resources to offer an improved user experience and services that are integrated into their existing platforms, a grasp of artificial intelligence that traditional banks are only just beginning to deploy, sophisticated clod computing, and an already loyal user base, could see up to 40% of the revenue currently generated by the US financial industry move over to Big Tech, according to MckInsey. Financial services disruption and innovation lead at PWC Arthur Hughes-Hallett believes that ability to have an insight into both sides of a transaction, will give the likes of Amazon and Google a unique competitive advantage against traditional financial incumbents: \"In terms of who's going to disrupt the market further, I think we're seeing it already with launching their credit card with Goldman Sachs...I see certainly Big Tech being a winner due to data. That idea of completing the circle, the idea that you can see both sides of a transaction. It's never happened in history. It's an amazing ability as you can see both how much people have in their bank account and what they're spending it on. If you're Amazon and you have that, how do others compete with that?\" Earlier this year, the Financial Stability Board, the international body responsible for monitoring the global financial system published a report on the impact of fintech on financial stability, and highlighted that big tech may in fact have more of a competitive impact on incumbent financial institutions. Kelly believes that the realms of data at their disposal means that big tech companies are in the position to offer highly personalised financial services and \"contextual lending\": \"If they have this true, continual view of a customer through their data, through their day-to-day banking, so that they can understand the financial needs in the context of a lending decision, perhaps before that customer has even realised that they need credit, they can implement credit policy around that, that gives them the ability to be most competitive. \"If I can understand through the data and the consent process from my individual user over time, what they're going to need before they need it, then it's a huge advertising and marketing advantage for some of these big tech companies. This is gold for them. How can I anticipate that need using more data and then how can I monetise that information whether it be me as a as a bank or as a broker or whatever mechanism I choose.\" Consumer trustHowever, given the track record of social media giants and user privacy, especially in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, big tech has a long way to go before users are willing to entrust them with their sensitive financial information: \"There's this weird disparity of trust when it comes to consumers. People trust their doctor who keeps their medical records in a filing cabinet but don't trust Facebook to keep them encrypted, who have a far more broad ranging information security policy. So the question is, again, why would I share my data with a big tech company? What experiences might they give me?\" The World Economic Forum has also highlighted that companies having access to both financial and non-financial information on users \"would raise serious questions about how best to avoid both anticompetitive behaviour and the inappropriate use of personal data\". When asked if he would be willing to give a company such as Amazon access to his banking transactions, Hughes-Hallett expressed that he would \"personally not be comfortable\" with the concept. There is also the matter of regulation. According to the BIS, the presence of big tech in the financial services market, either independently or in partnership with banks raises \"a host of questions around competition, financial inclusion, data protection and financial stability\". However, open banking regulation, or PSD2, means that in the EU, banks are now required to share information on customers' finances (with their permission) with third parties. This could mean that in the future finances could be integrated into other services without the need for Big Tech companies to acquire banking licenses. In this context, banks are therefore under increasing pressure to innovate and step up their digital products: \"You could argue one of the ways that they might greatly improve this experience in this context is by using banking API's to aggregate all of the data that an individual has. So if I could load in my Monzo account into this view of my spending and get it rewards in return that for another one that talked about a lot of payments.\" \"No big tech organisation is getting excited about being a bank\"Although they may pose a threat to traditional banking, this is just part of the picture for big tech. Kelly believes that by entering the financial sphere, big tech companies are not looking to become banks themselves, but rather as a means of gathering even more data, and further positioning themselves at the centre of users' everyday lives: \"A central question [for Big Tech] is how do we get more data, and therefore get more context and therefore be more relevant to our customers? And I think that's the continual message. And banking is perhaps just one way that they achieve that. But it isn't really the end goal. I think no big tech organisation is getting excited about being a bank, but they are getting excited about serving their customers, and being more central to their financial world and their general day to day transactions, whether that be payments or whether just be using their services.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-6F2734F4D9944A3CA24EBC34A3C55C7C</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-9YX1-JC0X-H00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1338\"/><timeReceived>6:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Nine years later, technology has come so far that such a scenario seems conceivable in the real world. Amazon continues to overtake sectors (most recently grocery stores), the tech magnate Elon Musk plans tocolonize Marsand just this week the world eagerly heralded the release ofanother iPhone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It might seem like it is only a matter of time before the tech giants knock on banking's door. In fact, a recentWorld Economic Forum reportposited thatbig tech companiespresent a greater challenge to banks than fintech startups. The report notes that regulators will accept a more \"oligopolistic distribution of financial services products by tech firms.\" Already, the fintech providers Social Finance and Square have applied forFDIC-insured banking charters, just as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency continues work to develop its limited-purpose fintech charter. Are the largest tech firms next in line?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banks should not be fatalistic about the threats posed by tech companies in financial services, however. Incumbents still hold the upper hand. The risk of an Amazon or Google or Apple dominating the traditional banking sector is nowhere near a slam dunk.</p><p>In every scenario, the tech giants would need to persuade regulators to grant them some kind of charter access in order to effectively compete and level the playing field on funding costs. This would involve easing traditional limits oncommercial firms owning banks, and potentially navigating opposition from members of Congress. Remember what happenedwhen Walmartapplied for a charter? And even if the tech firms gained entry to banking, they would face new regulatory constraints which would likely curtail their growth in even more important, higher margin core business segments.</p><p>But more fundamentally, tech giants havehad mixed experiencesin rolling out financial services such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay. And despite the reported consumer skepticism of legacy institutions, banks still continue to maintain a high volume of customer relationships.</p><p>True, tech barriers to entry into financial services are shrinking. However, barriers around capital, distribution, anti-fraud, security and regulatory requirements are constantly increasing; therefore, the competitive moat for incumbent banks has only been growing.</p><p>While the WEF report makes numerous valid points, such as detailing how nonincumbents'digital customer experienceshave raised the bar for what customers expect from their banks, it will take a long time, if ever, for the banking landscape to resemble the highly interconnected, neatly defined ecosystem to which the WEF report's conclusions lead.</p><p>The level of regulatory scrutiny of pricing and marketing tactics, commonplace in financial services, is quite unusual in most other consumer sectors, such as groceries. Unlike what they experience now, large tech companies that may aim to operate banks or offer banklike services would suddenly be forced to comply with a multitude of regulators that would in turn curtail their growth. Many large tech companies have escalated to dominance by maintaining the lowest-cost position. But offering lower-priced financial services, without the large deposit base enjoyed by banking powers, is not as simple as Amazonslashing priceson Whole Foods bananas.</p><p>Even through partnerships with banks, big tech companies cannot dodge the associated oversight and regulations with being in financial services. For example, Amazon attempted a partnership with Wells Fargo by marketing private student loans from the San Francisco bank to anyone with an Amazon Prime student account. The program, however, only lastedsix weeksbefore politicians criticized the program for charging higher interest rates and offering fewer repayment options when compared to federal student loan options.</p><p>Furthermore, banks have increasinglybeen partneringwith fintech companies to enhance their own digital offerings. As fintech helps banks deepen relationships with their customers, large tech companies may find it even harder to unseat these relationships. Already, the history of tech companies trying to attack banking's various moats is riddled with cautionary tales. Consider the consumer online lending industry, for example. Problems facing Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace have beenwell documented. Despite the marketplace lenders' supposed advanced technology, a decade of low interest rates and pristine consumer credit across the entire lending industry, both companies have struggled to find a way to turn a profit.</p><p>More recently, the disruption hype has been surrounding tech companies that are \"displacing\" banks in underwriting business loans. Case in point, an op-ed, \"Another industry Amazon plans to crush is small-business lending,\"appeared on CNBC this summer. While this op-ed and others have touted the momentum of OnDeck, Square and Amazon, in reality, their total volume of originations pale in comparison to larger banks. Certainly, Amazon has had some success - lending more than$3 billionto 20,000 small businesses in the U.S., U.K. and Japan on the Amazon marketplace since 2011. Since launching in 2014, payment processorSquarehas also lent more than $1.5 billion - which also sounds like a large number until you compare it to JPMorgan Chase, which has provided more than $130 billion to small businesses since 2011.</p><p>Is large tech luring customers away from banks, or is it targeting a different business? Volumes are small, the offerings are niche, and the terms are often demanding. At Amazon, borrowers must be invited, and Amazon has access to future sales revenue and inventory should borrowers not pay the loans back. We suspect many of the borrowers who turn to Amazon for loans are not business customers that banks would want to serve. The ideal bank customer is a business that needs a sizable loan or has longer-term funding needs - for which banks can offer more attractive interest rates because of their ability to fund and service the loans at a lower cost, while cross-selling multiple deposit and credit products. So while Amazon and others are bringing capital to an underserved market, their business strategies are still a far cry from an existing industry being \"crushed\" by a tech giant.</p><p>Given the impressive growth rate of many of the largest technology companies, it simply doesn't make financial sense to stymie that growth in order to enter a commoditized industry like lending or deposit-gathering that has not produced great return on equity over the last decade. And past efforts by major consumer retail conglomerates to enter financial services could be an omen for tech firms with similar ambitions. Between 1998 and 2007, Walmart attempted to obtain anFDIC-insured banking licenseseveral times. Eventually, the retailer had to back out due to the associated regulatory and political challenges. Home Depot's pursuit of a charter met a similar fate.</p><p>The bottom line? Although the headlines surrounding the WEF report paint an inevitable picture of a Silicon Valley-dominated banking industry, such a scenario actually playing out is less likely. The future of how big tech coexists with banking will more likely reside in co-opetition versus disruption.</p><p>The specialized products and services that are coming out of many upstart fintech firms are having the most impact on the industry by adding value to the existing financial ecosystem - mobile banking, faster payments and streamlined lending processes, to name a few. While the process of paying back a loan will never be as fun as online shopping, we expect the value-added services of these fintech companies to meaningfully enhance the banking experience in the years to come. We also may see closer alignment between financial institutions and large tech companies again to enhance the incumbents' offerings.</p><p>So despite all the hype, rest assured - by no means will the Bank of Amazon or Bank of Google be taking direct deposits to finance the apartment complex next door anytime soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000015e-80f7-d286-a3de-f2ff0bbe0000-179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGR-SSN1-JCRW-53GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1356\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SourceMedia, Inc.

Well, according to a recent study, there are a lot of you that would happily hand over the responsibility of keeping your money safe to either Google, Facebookor Amazon. But weirdly, not Apple? According to a poll carried out by Fujitsu - who themselves have a finance division[1]\u00a0- 20 percent of respondents said they would use Facebook, Googleor Amazon to buy banking or insurance services if available.So. </p><p>Much. Tech.Some of the biggest names in tech are coming to TNW Conference in Amsterdam this May.The reason behind the response, according to TechRadar[2], is that they expect big banks to keep rolling out technology innovations at the same pace that tech companies do. Failing to do so, would mean 37 percent would\u00a0leave their banking or insurance provider. But how likely is it that one of these big tech companies will move into big finance? Well, Googlehas been flirting with the idea through a series of small, but significant financial services.A bank of Google?There's Android\u00a0Pay - which is essentially an interface between your existing credit and debit cards, your phone and NFC card readers in stores - GoogleWallet, which is an older, clunkier version[3] that Pay was supposed to replace. There's a great piece on the difference between the two over on Android Central[4].Then there's other things like a mortgage calculator[5] available through search. You can also send money through Google, too.\u00a0Facebook does the same[6]. Amazon has taken a step further than both by\u00a0offering loans[7] to thousands of invited sellers in its market place. So we can assume these companies have an appetite for finance. But there are several glaring reasons why we won't ever have to write the headline, 'Googleopens its first banking branch' on TNW anytime soon. The first and most obvious one is regulations. They are so long and convoluted that in Britain, arguably the world's financial and currency hub,\u00a0before 2010 there had not been a single banking license granted in more than 100 years[8]. Admittedly, things have picked up a bit - but it still took a small private bank more than four years to get its license\u00a0[9]last year. That's just for Britain. In America, to operate as a bank you can't negotiate with just the government. You have to go from state-to-state applying for a charter to do business. You can find out more about how arduous that is over here[10]. Now imagine doing that from country to country.\u00a0This is a slow, cumbersome business. Not very Google, Amazon or Facebook.The boring business of bankingThe second major reason is pissing off giant financial institutions by launching a direct competitor is a very silly idea. A quick and decisive response to a Google or Facebookbank would be to remove support. So if Barclays didn't like the cut of Facebook's jib, it could easily tell its 48 million global customers that it no longer is going to let them send money through the social network. Credit: Facebook[11] That's a pretty big hole to fill for any company, even Facebook. Alternatively, the financial industry can lean on the US Chamber of Commerce, who spend more than a billion dollars lobbying the US government[12] on things it doesn't agree with, like climate change, and letting banks who did bad business during the credit crunch fail. [13] As a comparison, the tech industry spends 100 times less[14]. The third and most interesting reason for Googleet al to not open a bank is that there are so many other ways of capturing financial data without having to build a bank. One such company is Curve[15]. It allows users to combine all their existing cards from different banks into one card that is accepted everywhere. It then presents all of that data on your phone, in real time. Mondo, another British start-up[16] has created a card that you can use like the one a bank would issue but without the hassle. The problems with everyday banking for consumers, in my view, is down to basic things: convenience, customer service and a vested interest in you not maxing out your credit cards or being fined for going into your overdraft. So, in tech terms, its UX and customer service. Amazon for one prides itself on those two things[17], and could easily roll out a service that is, quick, easy to use and offers more one-on-one guidance to better money management. In March 2015 the Economist Intelligence Unit, when conducting a survey of the retail banking sector[18], found 25 percent of respondents felt technology could most effectively help banks know their customers better, and knowing people is Google's business already. The banking industry hasn't really grabbed onto how much detail a bank statement reveals when it comes to what stage of life a person is at, their hopes, dreams, anxieties and fears. Googleknows that already through what you tap into its search engine. Facebookknows what ethnicity you are purely by what you like.[19]\u00a0Amazon knows what you want before you'll buy it.[20] Googlewants payments as it gets the data of the purchase, as does Facebook. Amazon wants it to help push things to you at a later date that you're more likely to buy. But primarily, it's about the data and not the amount of transaction. Banks were built to handle dollars and cents, not bits and clicks.The University of Cambridge Judge Business School[21] noted the ongoing growth of non-cash payments, despite the financial crisis, and the development of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology used by Googleand others. That means cash reserves and assets will become (marginally) less important than the digital movement (and the context of that movement) of money online. These big tech companies are in prime position to offer smaller, more constrained financial services without ever becoming what we'd traditionally think of as a bank. Even the banks think so. 'It is more likely, like you see with Amazon, about being able to offer instalment credit, because you can make a 20-30 per cent return on that with the data you have, without necessarily having to open a branch,' Peter Simon, head of information at Barclays told Computer Business Review.[22] So while a fifth of you might want a bank of Amazon, in reality, what is more likely to happen is that Amazon will build a bank around you and your purchases, leaving your high street bank to do all the 'dumb' work like payment processing, currency exchanges and the like. Now that is a more exciting future.

Parents' concerns about data are encoded in the existing law that Markey alluded to expanding, but they also worry about the content that kids stumble across on big platforms. There's no shortage of constructive, good content for kids on the web, but no one, including parents, has figured out a good way for kids to be online, even if the big tech companies say they have. There are simply too many threats out there-disturbing videos, bullies, data exploitation-and the current regulatory scheme is built on a skewed picture of how parents, kids, and companies interact with each other.<br/>That scheme has a name: the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), passed in 1998. Twenty years later, its central concerns have held up well. Sites meant for kids under 13, or that have \"actual knowledge\" that those kids use a given site, have to get explicit parental consent to collect identifying information about them (and thus also to use that information for targeted advertising). \"Children, in the United States, are the only group of internet users who have opt-in rights\" for how companies use their data, Jeff Chester, an early advocate of the law and the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer-advocacy group, told me. \"That's the basic framework of COPPA.\" (What Markey was proposing would bump COPPA-style parental consent up to age 16.)<br/>But on Monday, Chester's organization and 22 other consumer-advocacy groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that Google's platform YouTube has violated that framework because it has \"actual knowledge\" that kids under 13 use the site and nonetheless harvests kids' phone numbers, geolocation data, and other unique identifiers as it would any older user. \"We are reviewing the complaint and will evaluate if there are things we can do to improve,\" a Google spokesperson told me via email, repeating a statement issued to the press earlier this week. \"Protecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.\"<br/>Sites like YouTube and Facebook sidestep COPPA by having users certify, when making an account or logging on, that they are 13 or older. But that doesn't always align with reality, Ariel Fox Johnson, the senior counsel for policy and privacy at Common Sense Media, an advocacy group that joined the complaint, told me: Lots of kids get past that safeguard. (It would make sense that tech companies are less than scrupulous about this, given how dependent their business models are on growing user bases and collecting that data for advertising.)<br/>YouTube has countless channels \"that are very clearly targeting kids,\" Fox Johnson said. \"For them to say 'We're not targeted toward kids on those channels' is a little bit hard to take.\" Indeed, YouTube is very popular with kids,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-kids-online/\">two-thirds of whom</url> in the 6-to-12 age range already have a personal device. Roughly three-quarters of kids in that age group use YouTube daily, according to a separate       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/5435eb4d1e426bb420ac990f/5a316f4f4a2f7d000196532b_2017%20Kid%20and%20Family%20Trends%20Report%20EXCERPT.PDF\">market-research study</url> cited in the complaint. And usage among kids is climbing, fast: Sixty-five percent of kids who use it hop on several times a day, up from 45 percent in 2015.<br/>For these reasons and many more, tech companies have cordoned off separate spaces for children: Facebook announced Messenger Kids in December, for example, because parents \"see value in these technologies,\" Antigone Davis, the global head of safety at Facebook, told me, and \"they want more control.\" And \"because       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms\">YouTube is not for children</url>,\" the Google spokesperson said, the company built YouTube Kids three years ago \"to offer an alternative specifically designed\" for them.<br/>But while those platforms offer parents more control, are often freer from ads, and insulate companies from a certain degree of liability, they've attracted controversies of their own. Many of the same advocacy groups criticizing YouTube       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/30/technology/facebook-messenger-kids-letter/index.html\">are pressuring</url>Facebook to shut down its new app, saying kids are too young to start navigating social media that most adults can barely handle themselves. Davis told me Messenger Kids will keep operating, but \"we are continuing to do research in this area. Parents rightfully think they are in the best position to determine the needs and manage their children's online experiences.\" Facebook's role, as she sees it, \"is providing them with research-based information and guidance, and the tools that they need to control that experience for their children.\"<br/>YouTube Kids, too, has been criticized for hosting disturbing videos that had crept from its main site past its algorithms: Kids have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html\">stumbled across</url> videos of Mickey Mouse covered in blood, characters from the animated series PAW Patrol committing suicide, or of a young girl apparently treated roughly and bleeding. While the videos account for a tiny fraction of the content the app's 11 million weekly users see, they have drawn attention to the monumental task of sorting content with automated filters. And in any case, while YouTube Kids is booming, the same media-research survey of 8,200 kids and parents found that its parent site is still the \"most powerful brand in kids' lives.\" (Google declined to comment on the details of the study.)<br/>And that's just for the platforms where kids belong. It's not much easier to control how children get on the platforms where they're not supposed to be, and thus, how their data sneaks past COPPA protections. \"There's huge incentives for [kids] and families to lie about age\"-as in, confirming that kids are 13 or older when they're not-\"so even the data [about users that companies keep] gets corrupted,\" Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist and professor at the University of California, Irvine, told me. Kids (and parents) want engaging, cheap, or free videos regardless of how old they are; in practice, Ito said, many children start navigating the web on their own, without parental consent, around age 10.<br/>\"If you're a for-profit that provides free services or content that are of value to kids under 13, then it's very difficult to be successful and to be COPPA-compliant,\" Ito said. \"And that's where you're seeing families routing around the policy as much as the companies are.\" It's simply not realistic to assume kids are truly getting parental consent as they start to form independent identities in early adolescence, she added. Asking for that all the way up to age 16 will hardly improve the odds. And, of course, parents are already some of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/babies-everywhere/502757/?utm_source=feed\">biggest violators of their kids' privacy</url> anyway, posting content and leaving digital footprints well before the age of consent. \"Many parents are complicit in this,\" Ito said.<br/>That's not to say the current situation is a catastrophe-there are protections, and even then, many parents ignore them. But the legal framework in the U.S. is patchy, a melange of voluntary industry standards, FTC rules, and state laws. For legal solutions, American privacy advocates often pine for the rigor of Europe, which baked privacy concerns into its earliest laws governing the internet.<br/>COPPA is a sort of \"opt-in\" privacy band-aid for one set of Americans. Right now, most legal options under discussion such as Senator Markey's are simply a sort of \"opt-in plus,\" Ari Ezra Waldman, a professor at New York Law School, told me-expanding that law's relatively basic guidelines, which govern the collection of data more than its use, to a broader group, or to everyone. But Waldman said the U.S. could do more by shifting toward a European-style \"privacy by design\": \"We should regulate how companies design their tools, and require that privacy and ethical considerations be embedded into products, rather than just notifying people of how bad their data practices are.\"<br/>The latest iteration of Europe's privacy law is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will be put into force in May and includes requirements for kids. While the new rules incorporate aspects of U.S. law like COPPA, European agencies tend to go further in enforcement. The stricter policies there, Chester, of the Center for Digital Democracy, told me, might later be used to fight a \"two-front war\" for kids' privacy in the U.S., \"pushing for strong public policies in Congress, which are unlikely to be passed, [and] raising concerns at the corporate level, saying, 'Hey Google, why are you treating kids' privacy better in the EU than the kids in your own backyard?'\"<br/>Ito hopes, however, that the current fears over children's data privacy don't overshadow the creative and connective possibilities of the web. When her family, for instance, wants to learn how to fold origami lobsters together, they go to YouTube. In her research, she came across a girl who grew a Minecraft hobby into a Minecraft club at her school, which itself turned into a mini video-production operation. The kid internet, in other words, doesn't have to be bad-it's just that the way it's currently regulated means it often is.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-childdataprivacy557840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3C-B501-JCG7-V339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

And now, in a hotel thronging with tech executives, she was recounting her plan to overhaul how their companies treat children.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem, as Baroness Kidron sees it, is that apps like YouTube and Instagram use data-fueled enticements \u2014 such as tallying \u201clikes\u201d and automatically personalizing videos that play one after another \u2014 to get youngsters hooked on their services. Children, she says, are no match for the turbocharged influence tactics, and often stay glued to the services even if doing so makes them unhappy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe idea that it\u2019s O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons \u2014 it\u2019s not a fair fight,\u201d Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. \u201cIt\u2019s little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.\u201d</p><p>Her goal is to counter that power dynamic, so that children\u2019s rights and protections in the digital world more closely resemble those in real life. And she\u2019s not just talking about it \u2014 she is changing the law.</p><p>Lady Kidron, who was born a commoner, helped lead a campaign to remake how Facebook, Google and other tech companies treat children online in Britain. Two years ago, she persuaded her peers in Parliament to push through sweeping new rules meant to stop online services from exploiting children\u2019s personal data to manipulate their behavior. The changes are meeting fierce resistance, with tech companies and trade groups lobbying to weaken the new rules before they are codified this year.</p><p>Lady Kidron\u2019s efforts are part of a drive by lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to rein in the immense power, and data abuses, of Big Tech. Amid that intensifying scrutiny, some officials have zeroed in on the companies\u2019 treatment of children.</p><p>In March, Senators Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">a bill to strengthen children\u2019s online privacy</url>. In July, the Federal Trade Commission said it was considering       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">updating a children\u2019s privacy rule</url> to keep pace with advances in technology. Also last month, Senator Hawley introduced       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">a \u201csocial media addiction bill\u201d</url> that would require online services to turn off \u201cnudging\u201d techniques like autoplaying videos \u2014 an effort that seems inspired by the new British rules.</p><p>\u201cParents are concerned. Parliamentarians are concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth Denham, Britain\u2019s information commissioner, an independent government regulator who wrote the new children\u2019s rules after Lady Kidron persuaded Parliament to support the protections. \u201cThe kids aren\u2019t all right.\u201d</p><p>It took a long time for Silicon Valley to see Lady Kidron coming. That may be because she does not fit the mold \u2014 privacy advocate, remorseful former tech executive \u2014 of a typical industry challenger.</p><p>Lady Kidron, 58, says she developed her antennae for power, and how people wield it, as a child in London. While healing from surgery to repair a cleft palate when she was 10 years old, she was not allowed to run or speak. To communicate, she carried around a pencil, a notebook and a horn \u2014 \u201clike Harpo Marx,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOne thing about being silent for a period of a year is that you very much notice who is included, who is excluded, who is dominant, who is excluded and where the power lies,\u201d Lady Kidron recounted.</p><p>She channeled that interest in power dynamics into a career as a filmmaker. She alternated directing popular feature films \u2014 \u201cBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\u201d \u2014 with making documentaries on social justice issues like child prostitution in India.</p><p>In 2012, she was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">one of two commoners nominated</url> to serve in the House of Lords, an appointment that came with the lifetime aristocratic title of baroness. That year, Lady Kidron decided to make a documentary about children and the internet,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">\u201cInRealLife.\u201d</url></p><p>She spent months embedded with tweens and teenagers, sitting next to them as they lived their digital lives. They exchanged messages with friends, fell in love with strangers, were bullied, watched pornography and played video games. The documentary features the children describing how they felt simultaneously interested, hooked, influenced and repulsed by online services.</p><p>\u201cI was worried about some of the feelings they were having,\u201d Lady Kidron said.</p><p>By 2014, Lady Kidron had started <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">a foundation, 5Rights</url>, to promote children\u2019s digital rights. But she felt frustrated with major tech companies. They scrambled to handle one problem after another for children on their sites, she said, but appeared unwilling to make major changes to try to avert such problems in the first place. She concluded that the only way to give children more privacy, more freedom and more control over their online experiences was through regulation.</p><p>In 2017, she proposed the idea of children\u2019s online protections in Parliament as an amendment to a national data protection bill. The bill generally called for protections for children\u2019s data, but Lady Kidron pushed to detail those protections.</p><p>In real life, \u201cwe\u2019ve already decided that children have rights,\u201d Lady Kidron said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all a part of just making tech normal.\u201d</p><p>The proposed rules are called the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">Age Appropriate Design Code</url>. Among other things, they would require that online services turn on by default the highest privacy settings for all minors, preventing things like automated location tracking. They would also require the services to automatically turn off techniques that could push children to stay online longer or provide the companies with more personal data than necessary.</p><p>The changes present a challenge to platforms like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">YouTube</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">Instagram</url>, which have said their services are not intended for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">people under 13</url> \u2014 even though tens of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">millions of children use them</url>. The British code would apply to all online services, including social networks and messaging apps, that are likely to have users who are under 18.</p><p>\u201cIt is provocative to technology companies,\u201d Ms. Denham, the information commissioner, acknowledged. \u201cIt is going to change systematically, and on a systems level, how services are delivered for kids.\u201d</p><p>The tech industry is pushing back, saying the code is too broad and so vague that it will be difficult to comply with.</p><p>In particular, companies have objected to the code\u2019s definition of a child as a person under 18 \u2014 instead of, say, 13 or 16. They have also objected to applying the protections not just to children\u2019s sites but to all sites in Britain that are likely to have minors as users. A children\u2019s online privacy law in the United States, by contrast, applies only to nursery rhyme apps and other services directed at children under 13.</p><p>Industry and civil liberties experts also warn that the code could reduce user privacy, the opposite of its intended outcome. To comply with the code, these critics say, apps might need to collect more information about users to determine their age.</p><p>Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had held discussions with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office about the children\u2019s code. Last month, the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">hosted a design challenge</url> to create ways to show teens online how their data is being collected and used.</p><p>\u201cFacebook works with parents, experts, and policymakers to ensure that privacy and safety measures are in place to protect teens and limit the ways young people can be targeted by advertisers,\u201d said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe are committed to continuing this work.\u201d</p><p>Google, which owns YouTube and offers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">an app to help parents</url> control their children\u2019s internet use, declined to comment.</p><p>In public comments filed with Ms. Denham\u2019s office last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">the companies said</url> parents should be the ultimate arbiters of their children\u2019s internet use.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">Facebook also warned</url> that strict new standards might inadvertently push young people to use untrustworthy services that ignored the rules.</p><p>\u201cThe code is trying to break new ground and being very ambitious,\u201d said Vinous Ali, the head of policy for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">TechUK, a trade organization in London</url> whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. \u201cYet it is not taking a very targeted, narrow approach to where the harms are.\u201d</p><p>Lady Kidron and Ms. Denham said some companies seemed not to have processed the idea that under the new rules, their businesses would need to put the best interests of children above their corporate bottom lines.</p><p>\u201cWhat I haven\u2019t heard from the companies is acknowledgment about the kind of practices that are in place right now to keep kids\u2019 eyes online,\u201d Ms. Denham said, practices \u201cthat push for a quantification of friends, that enable more data-mining, that treat our kids like commodities.\u201d</p><p>Back at the boutique hotel, it was time for Lady Kidron to head to her room. She was meeting the next day with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/baroness-kidron/4258\">Nick Clegg</url>, Facebook\u2019s global policy head and a former deputy prime minister of Britain, to discuss the company\u2019s objections to the children\u2019s code. And she wanted to prepare.</p><p>\u201cThe main thing they are asking me is: \u2018Are you really expecting companies to give up profits by restricting the data they collect on children?\u2019\u201d she said, referring to various online services she had met with this year. \u201cOf course I am! Of course, everyone should.\u201d</p><p>As she arose from a rattan couch and crossed the largely empty hotel patio, a Facebook policy lawyer spied her and came over to welcome her to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\u201cAm I really welcome?\u201d Lady Kidron asked pointedly in a comment that was half charm, half stiletto.</p><p>\u201cYou are always welcome,\u201d the lawyer said.</p><p>The conversation quickly finished, and Lady Kidron, still mulling the comment, moved off toward the lobby.</p><p>\u201cThe more trouble you are,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthe more they say that to you.\u201d</p><p>Natasha Singer covers privacy for The Times.

And now, in a hotel thronging with tech executives, she was recounting her plan to overhaul how their companies treat children.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem, as Baroness Kidron sees it, is that apps like YouTube and Instagram use data-fuelled enticements - such as tallying \"likes\" and automatically personalizing videos that play one after another - to get youngsters hooked. Children, she says, are no match for the influence tactics and often stay glued to the services, even if doing so makes them unhappy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The idea that it's OK to nudge kids into endless behaviours, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons - it's not a fair fight,\" Kidron said. \"It's little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley.\"</p><p>Her goal is to counter that power dynamic, so that children's rights in the digital world more closely resemble those in real life. And she's not just talking about it - she's changing the law.</p><p>Kidron, who was born a commoner, helped lead a campaign to remake how Facebook, Google and other tech companies treat children online in Britain. Two years ago, she persuaded her peers in Parliament to push through sweeping new rules meant to stop online services from exploiting children's personal data to manipulate their behaviour. The changes are meeting fierce resistance, with tech companies and trade groups lobbying to weaken the new rules before they are codified this year.</p><p>Kidron's efforts are part of a drive by lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to rein in the immense power, and data abuses, of Big Tech. Amid that intensifying scrutiny, some officials have zeroed in on the companies' treatment of children.</p><p>In March, Democratic Sens. Edward J. Markey and Josh Hawley introduced a bill to strengthen children's online privacy. In July, the Federal Trade Commission said it was considering updating a children's privacy rule to keep pace with advances in technology. Also last month, Hawley introduced a \"social media addiction bill\" that would require online services to turn off \"nudging\" techniques like autoplaying videos - an effort that seems inspired by the new British rules.</p><p>\"Parents are concerned. Parliamentarians are concerned,\" said Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, an independent government regulator who wrote the new children's rules after Kidron persuaded Parliament to support the protections. \"The kids aren't all right.\"</p><p>It took a long time for Silicon Valley to see Kidron coming. That may be because she doesn't fit the mould - privacy advocate, remorseful former tech executive - of a typical industry challenger.</p><p>Kidron, 58, says she developed her antennae for power, and how people wield it, as a child in London. While healing from surgery to repair a cleft palate when she was 10, she wasn't allowed to run or speak. To communicate, she carried around a pencil, a notebook and a horn - \"like Harpo Marx,\" she said.</p><p>\"One thing about being silent for a period of a year is that you very much notice who is included, who is excluded, who is dominant, who is excluded and where the power lies,\" Kidron recounted.</p><p>She channelled that interest in power dynamics into a career as a filmmaker. She alternated directing popular feature films - Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason - with making documentaries on social justice issues, such as child prostitution in India.</p><p>In 2012, she was one of two commoners nominated to serve in the House of Lords, an appointment that came with the lifetime aristocratic title of baroness. That year, Kidron decided to make a documentary about children and the internet, InRealLife.</p><p>She spent months embedded with tweens and teenagers, sitting next to them as they lived their digital lives. They exchanged messages with friends, fell in love with strangers, were bullied, watched pornography and played video games. The documentary features the children describing how they felt simultaneously interested, hooked, influenced and repulsed by online services.</p><p>\"I was worried about some of the feelings they were having,\" Kidron said.</p><p>By 2014, Kidron had started a foundation, 5Rights, to promote children's digital rights. But she felt frustrated with major tech companies. They scrambled to handle one problem after another for children on their sites, she said, but appeared unwilling to make major changes to try to avert such problems in the first place. She concluded that the only way to give children more control over their online experiences was through regulation.</p><p>In 2017, she proposed the idea of children's online protections in Parliament as an amendment to a data protection bill. The bill generally called for protections for children's data, but Kidron pushed to detail those protections.</p><p>In real life, \"we've already decided that children have rights,\" Kidron said. \"For me, it's all a part of just making tech normal.\"</p><p>The proposed rules are called the Age Appropriate Design Code. They would require that online services turn on by default the highest privacy settings for all minors, preventing things like automated location tracking. They would also require the services to automatically turn off techniques that could push children to stay online longer.</p><p>The changes present a challenge to platforms like YouTube and Instagram, which have said their services are not intended for people under 13 - even though tens of millions of children use them. The British code would apply to all online services that are likely to have users who are under 18.</p><p>\"It is provocative to technology companies,\" Denham, the information commissioner, said. \"It is going to change systematically, and on a systems level, how services are delivered for kids.\"</p><p>The tech industry is pushing back, saying the code is too broad and so vague that it will be difficult to comply with.</p><p>In particular, companies have objected to the code's definition of a child as a person under 18 - instead of, say, 13 or 16. They have also objected to applying the protections not just to children's sites but to all sites in Britain that are likely to have minors as users. A children's online privacy law in the U.S., by contrast, applies only to nursery rhyme apps and other services directed at children under 13.</p><p>Industry and civil liberties experts also warn that the code could reduce user privacy, the opposite of its intended outcome. To comply with the code, these critics say, apps might need to collect more information about users to determine their age.</p><p>Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had held discussions with the Information Commissioner's Office about the children's code. Last month, the company hosted a design challenge to create ways to show teens online how their data is being collected and used.</p><p>\"Facebook works with parents, experts, and policy-makers to ensure that privacy and safety measures are in place to protect teens and limit the ways young people can be targeted by advertisers,\" said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesperson. \"We are committed to continuing this work.\"</p><p>Google, which owns YouTube and offers an app to help parents control their children's internet use, declined to comment.</p><p>In public comments filed with Denham's office last year, the companies said parents should be the arbiters of their children's internet use. Facebook also warned that strict new standards might push young people to use untrustworthy services that ignored the rules.</p><p>\"The code is trying to break new ground,\" said Vinous Ali, head of policy for TechUK, a trade organization whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. \"Yet it is not taking a very targeted, narrow approach to where the harms are.\"</p><p>Kidron and Denham said some companies seemed not to have processed the idea that under the new rules, their businesses would need to put the best interests of children above their profit.</p><p>\"What I haven't heard from the companies is acknowledgment about the kind of practices that are in place right now to keep kids' eyes online,\" Denham said, practices \"that push for a quantification of friends, that enable more data-mining, that treat our kids like commodities.\"</p><p>Back at the boutique hotel, it was time for Kidron to head to her room. She was meeting the next day with Nick Clegg, Facebook's global policy head, to discuss the company's objections to the children's code. And she wanted to prepare.</p><p>\"The main thing they are asking me is: 'Are you really expecting companies to give up profits by restricting the data they collect on children?'\" she said, referring to various online services she had met with this year. \"Of course I am! Of course, everyone should.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019083155483774</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WY2-5GN1-DY91-K2K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 31, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They asked me all sorts of questions about Facebook and Google, artificial intelligence and 5G, data and privacy, and blockchain (of course) because, you know, I\u2019m a tech editor. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They asked if they should delete their Facebook account (yes), if AI is really coming for us (maybe), if 5G will really be the transformative technology we say it will be (it depends). But then they asked about the implications of giving our data to brands, or how safe it is to use \u201csmart\u201d technologies, and the discussion turned toward literature and how similar questions of technological advancement have permeated society for quite some time.</p><p>Three books\u20141984, Brave New World, The Circle\u2014each present an argument about tech. 1984, we\u2019re taught, is about a Big Brother surveillance state; Brave New World shows us how technology can numb us; The Circle shines a light on what it means to be fully transparent.\u00a0Each, in its own way, brings technological determinism to the front of the class, parading it as a fait accompli. The march of technology cannot be stopped\u2014the vision of a dystopian future where technology towers over us, scares us, comforts us, entertains us. </p><p>As the Gregorian calendar, its own special type of technological relativism, flips from 2018 to 2019, the questions of ethics, of legal implications, of rights, get louder, more pointed.\u00a0The\u00a0legal and moral implications of people willingly giving up their data are going to intensify in 2019 in ways we\u2019ve only seen in science fiction.</p><p>Take, for example, the three big tech companies that seem to be at the center of, well, everything: Facebook, Amazon and Google.</p><p>In early October, Facebook rolled out its video camera product, Portal, about which my colleague David Cohen wrote: \u201cUnder intense scrutiny over\u00a0privacy\u00a0and its\u00a0handling of user data, Facebook apparently believes people will welcome a Facebook device, complete with a camera that follows people around the room, into their homes.\u201d</p><p>Google spent all of 2018 pumping millions in marketing money into convincing you, dear reader, that its Google Home Hub is the smart device you need to be a more efficient human. Make Google do it for you, the tagline goes. Or maybe all that marketing money, more strategically, was trying to catch up to Amazon. It worked.</p><p>Amazon, in its quest to make our lives simpler, continues to introduce variations of its Echo Show (as well as all the other products it\u2019s developed or bought that encroach on our personal privacy\u2014Ring, Blink, Go, etc.). At the very least, it makes for a good receptionist, as the Barbarian Group told another colleague, tech staff writer Lisa Lacy, earlier this year.</p><p>All three of these products present ethical quandaries for users. How much of our privacy do we give up in order to turn on the lights by asking an assistant? Should our data be ours, or is it part of the unsigned contract we make with tech companies to use their free services?</p><p>Next year will only intensify the chasm between the tech companies and legal entities that want to regulate them.</p><p>In a late-November FTC hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said, \u201cBig tech is no longer entitled to [America\u2019s] trust, if it ever was, and big tech is maybe no longer entitled to be as big as it is.\u00a0Misuse of bigness can be in violation of antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>This year saw California and Vermont pass data-regulation laws, months after the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect. Deliberations will continue to stretch into the near future at the federal level.</p><p>What it all boils down to is this: One day, we\u2019ll have to reckon with the fact that these three companies know more about us than any living being. Google knows what I\u2019m curious about; Facebook knows what I like; Amazon knows what I buy. This is incredibly powerful, if not chilling. Of course, the challenge for our industry is that Google, Facebook and Amazon each present significant revenue and revenue opportunities for the three pillars of our industry: brands, agencies and publishers.</p><p>People talk about the backlash against \u201ctech,\u201d but it\u2019s specific categories that they\u2019re actually afraid of. My friends\u2019 questions were geared toward this thinking, diving into science-fiction-type parables. They\u2019re scared of constantly being watched, giving up their data, losing their identity. </p><p>And yet, they still gladly sign up for sites using their phone number, which is more valuable than your Social Security number. They still post pictures of their kids on the internet. They are not as afraid as I, your humble tech editor.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps they should be. They\u2019ve read the books.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1002051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWJ-3CX1-JC8H-T1FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 3, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Will the People's Republic of China beat the United States of America?  If so, what are the implications? Kai-fu Lee, a former executive at  Apple, SGI, Microsoft, and Google, argues in his novel AI Superpowers  that China will outpace America in terms of AI development thanks to  abundant data, eager entrepreneurs, well-educated and trained  scientists, and a supportive policy landscape. However, the debate must  be reframed: it's not a battle between the United States and China, but  it instead appears to be a tug-of-war between seven technology  companies\u2014Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft on the American team  and Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent on the Chinese side. Kai-fu Lee  highlights these seven companies as ones spearheading the movement.</p><p>Dive into this game further and the key <br/>players become clearer: it's not even between the seven companies listed<br/>above. It's simply a race of two giants pioneering access to consumer <br/>goods: Amazon and Alibaba.<br/>Ultimately, these two companies' combination of consumer data and <br/>extraordinarily precise supply chains have not only shaped retail, but <br/>they are also mastering the so-called third level of AI called <br/>perception. In AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee describes four layers of AI:</p><p>Internet as a recommendation agent (e.g., Gmail providing suggestions when drafting emails)Business applications, especially with big dataPerception, in particular facial recognition and speech recognitionAutonomous hardware, such as self-driving cars</p><p>The third AI layer illustrates the <br/>increasing complexity of AI and its use. When thinking of how these two <br/>companies are improving \"perception,\" Alexa already comes to mind, but <br/>can Amazon take it further? How does Alibaba plan to catch up? Or is it <br/>already ahead?</p><p>Amazon has developed a cachet of <br/>products that seamlessly integrate AI. Through its omni-channel <br/>presence, the tech behemoth implements machine learning in ventures such<br/>as the Amazon Go store, its recommendation engine, Amazon Web Services <br/>(by offering solutions to large and small businesses), and most <br/>famously, its Amazon Alexa speaker. This gives Amazon a massive <br/>advantage over competitors, such as Facebook and Google, as Amazon is <br/>looking to take over these companies with regards to advertising. By <br/>having access to what customers purchase, instead of unclear data on <br/>whether customers are simply scrolling past ads or going through with <br/>the purchase, Amazon provides a competitive advantage to companies looking to optimize marketing. Amazon's Basics generic brand also enhances consumer data collection. It is also exploring other ways to collect data, such as by sending free samples to see how consumers respond.<br/>Amazon has remained mindful of its data use. When it developed an AI <br/>algorithm to develop resumes, they scrapped the project because the dataset lacked women and discriminated against resumes with the word \"women.\"</p><p>However, as Amazon invests in projects, such as AI-powered doorbell cameras to prevent package theft and facial recognition technology to detect criminals, its own shareholders and activist groups stall Amazon's progress by limiting the sale of AI facial recognition tech to law enforcement. San Francisco<br/>became the first major U.S. city to ban the use of facial recognition <br/>in the same field. While American citizens continue upholding standards <br/>of ethics and morals regarding AI, it may come at the expense of <br/>technological development. Then, how can the U.S. continue peeling the <br/>layers of AI, as Kai-fu Lee describes?</p><p>Meanwhile, due to China's political and social structure, the government is doing exactly what the American government, particularly the White House, is not. By outwardly expressing approval for \"Big Tech\" and protecting major companies from competition, China has already seen a wave of innovation sweep over the country and beyond its borders. Alibaba is already the largest R&amp;D spender in China.<br/>At its core, Alibaba has employed strategies similar to Amazon by <br/>leading the use of AI in improving customers' shopping experience and <br/>developing smart speakers. China smart speaker adoption is poised to <br/>grow 166% in 2019 with Alibaba set to maintain its market share lead.<br/>China's demographics help significantly; with a population nearly <br/>quadruple that of America's, it's easier to access more data points, <br/>strengthening Alibaba's algorithms.</p><p>When looking beyond business models and <br/>products, stark differences appear. Alibaba operates in a completely <br/>different landscape. It is also collaborating with the Chinese <br/>government to implement the City Brain project, which is a cloud-based <br/>system where AI algorithms process data about a city and its citizens to<br/>improve overall living standards. Alibaba has already worked with Shanghai's<br/>transportation system to build machines that provide routes on vocal <br/>requests and developing a facial recognition machine that checks ID. As American citizens critique AI innovation, China's government is lauding it.</p><p>As the United States government has put AI development on the backburner, Chairman Xi Jinping has pledged to build a $1 trillion industry by 2030.<br/>The U.S. is cutting funding for research and education overall; this, <br/>along with stricter immigration policies, can be a detriment to the <br/>country. The current state of America raises many questions on how it <br/>should deal with this situation.</p><p>Should the U.S. approach developing AI from the lens of the military?<br/>While the Department of Defense traditionally developed cutting-edge <br/>technology, it most likely cannot compete in the way it used to during <br/>the Cold War. There is already discussion that the U.S. is more likely <br/>to spend on maintaining and upgrading mature systems and underinvest in <br/>technological breakthroughs. Instead, the innovation hub is clearly <br/>Silicon Valley, with smaller hubs appearing in cities across the <br/>country.Should President Donald Trump sharply criticize Amazon? Most <br/>certainly not. Trump and Xi have opposite views with regards to dealing <br/>with these major technology companies. Already, we see the Chinese <br/>leader steering the technology sector to maintain a competitive position<br/>in the global arena. In contrast, Trump has lacked a clear direction <br/>when it comes to his approach to technology.Should American regulators discuss the breakup of \"Big Tech\"? A <br/>radical idea, but definitely the most harmful. These technology <br/>companies, especially Amazon, have amassed influence because of their <br/>talent and overwhelming presence. Splitting them up will lead to weaker <br/>and smaller companies. On the other hand, Chinese conglomerates will <br/>continue achieving scale and eventually overtake these smaller, <br/>broken-up companies.Have cities such as San Francisco established precedent on banning <br/>certain technologies due to ethical implications? Is this the right <br/>approach? Several cities have already adopted legislation banning facial recognition.<br/>This will certainly stall AI development. The strength of algorithms <br/>depends on the quality of the dataset. If cities deprive companies of <br/>information, then the AI will be trapped in a cycle of poor datasets <br/>leading to poor technology. Meanwhile, Chinese companies have installed (and are exporting) facial recognition technology.More broadly, how can local governments balance support of Amazon<br/>and the economic benefits it brings while also protecting constituents? <br/>As Chinese cities are embracing technology companies' involvement into <br/>their day-to-day lives, American cities are doing the opposite. The best<br/>example is of Amazon and its plan to build its second headquarters in <br/>New York City. Amazon eventually scrapped the project,<br/>ultimately forcing Amazon to focus on expanding to Virginia. These <br/>types of political debates, while certainly healthy in democratic <br/>societies, eventually slow down progress in the long term. Amazon was <br/>unlocking a lot of potential in New York by tapping into a unique labor <br/>pool and accelerating expansion; however, its citizens prevented it from<br/>executing. Thus, if cities want to be competitive and support the <br/>overall effort to improve technology, they have to be much more <br/>supportive of the private companies and be willing to let them grow <br/>quickly.</p><p>The more regulation, whether from the  government or society, America puts in place, the more its citizens  effectively halt the progress of artificial intelligence. As Amazon  attempts to take one step forward, current social and political forces  it to take two steps back. Currently, Amazon and Alibaba have comparable  levels of technology thanks to their access to consumer data, but that  won't be for long. Amazon will soon be left in the dust as Alibaba races  to the AI finish line.</p><p>*About the author: Joshita Varshney, an intern at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, is a current junior at the University of Pennsylvania's Huntsman Program, a dual degree program through The Wharton School and the College of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Source: This article was published by FPRI</p><p>The post The Battle For Artificial Intelligence Supremacy: Corporations Or Countries? - Analysis appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-156059559</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7J-YJX1-F11P-X17G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While certainly not Luddites, those who form this vanguard are more inclined to question the untrammelled growth of technology as the creeping invasion, almost by stealth, of a handful of giant corporations (call them Big Tech if you like) and their profit motive into some of humanity's most personal spaces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not to put too fine a point on it, but while there is no sense in succumbing to the Luddite view of the world, that recoils at every expansion of the use of technology as one would at the sight of a marauding army, the past few years have thrown up a number of episodes to demonstrate why it may indeed be a good thing to start questioning the tech giants. Nevermind that some of them have pledged to 'do no evil'.</p><p>My mention of the most famous (or now infamous) line ever to appear in a company's mission statement draws a scoff from Dan Chefet, described by US outlet NPR as \"the Paris lawyer who gives Google nightmares\". Now if that doesn't make you sit up and take notice, nothing ever will. The reason they said that is because since 2013, Chefet has waged an astonishingly effective campaign in Europe, to thwart the torrent of fake news and damaging personal attacks that have come to dominate discourse on the web, to the detriment, in subtle and varied ways, of our lived experience.</p><p>In 2014, he won what may have been the most powerful single case of all against Google: the right to get search results about oneself removed, thus establishing the \"right to be forgotten\" on the internet. It addressed an issue very specific to the internet, where previously a smear, no matter how defamatory or ill-founded with malicious intent, could live forever and taint an individual's reputation. Not anymore of course. At least not in Europe.</p><p>This past week, he was in Dhaka to attend a symposium organised by the Cosmos Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Dhaka Courier's parent company, on fake news and its subversion of democratic systems, where he delivered a thoughtful and engaging keynote. In the post-2016 world, what started out as a personal matter for Chefet has grown into an issue of global import, befuddling authorities grappling with how to control it, and individuals unsure of who to even trust anymore. The day after the event, I had the opportunity to sit down with him one-on-one, and delve deeper into what informed the work that has catapulted him to global renown.</p><p>\"I think the main challenge that you face as an emerging economy is that you want to welcome in technology and apply it for its good purposes, but you need to also preserve not only your sovereignty, but also your culture, your language and your traditions. What we've seen is that one of the main reasons behind some of the social unrest and regional instability that we see around the world today is that things move too fast,\" Chefet says, at which I cannot help but invoke another famous Silicon Valley company's mission statement: \"Move fast and break things.\"Again it draws the scorn of the 63-year-old Chefet, whose boundless energy is enough to fill a room. He is far from imposing, but speaks with passion and is good-humoured. About the only sign I see that he may cause nightmares to anybody, let alone Google, is the slightly mischievous glint in his eyes. By his own admission though, he has no love for the \"saviours of humanity\" spawned in Silicon Valley.</p><p>And so he takes enormous pleasure in talking about a landmark ruling last January, in which France's data protection watchdog fined Google 50 million euros ($57 million) for breaching European Union online privacy rules, the biggest such penalty levied against a U.S. tech giant.</p><p>The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the biggest shake-up of data privacy laws in more than two decades, came into force last May ('May 25th', Chefet pinpoints). It allows users to better control their personal data and gives regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations. Chefet clearly loves it, repeating the word 'global' not once, not twice, but thrice - to emphasise the significantly larger pot from which the fine will be derived.</p><p>\"Look, these companies have been so clever, I have to say, in how wherever there has been some criticism of their practices, they have quickly turned the conversation around to some concept like freedom, so that ultimately people are protesting on their behalf,\" he says almost incredulously, before putting a clever spin on Churchill: \"Never before has so much information been controlled by so few.\"</p><p>\"Breaking things may do irreparable harm in social settings that are not used to that same set of American values, or actually Silicon Valley values, or lack of values! In fact they're corporate interests. Essentially you are left with 3 different choices when it comes to regulation, that I divide geographically: you have the US, that is 100% free speech, brooking almost no regulation. Almost dogmatically so. On the other side you have the Chinese, which is more-or-less the complete opposite, in that it is state-controlled. Then you have the European model, which is kind of in-between: it aims to strike a balance. That is in one with our values. Our history is such, at least after the Renaissance, that we aim to find the more nuanced way of doing things.</p><p>\"Those are the three choices, and I obviously advocate the European model going forward, but you have the advantage as a late-comer of choosing from our experience and what we learn from it,\" Chefet offers, after I explain how his battles revolve around certain concepts (privacy for one) that have yet to mature in the Bangladeshi context. The work he has done out of his Parisian legal practise, Cabinet Chefet, and more recently as founder of the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy, or AAID, which works to introduce \"a general principle of accountability on the internet,\" will serve as warnings.</p><p>We live in interesting times. It would seem more than a few countries have in the last decade or so witnessed some iteration of a state-sponsored scheme to go 'Digital'. Bangladesh, and India certainly have. Indeed in both cases, they are still ongoing. And yet at the same time there are those who are starting to push back, \"finally waking up to the fact that they are being manipulated\", in Chefet's words. That may come across as scathing, but he clearly is onto something when he talks about the importance of recognising that the rapid pace of change in the field means no-one can be sure where it's going. He even uses it to absolve 'Big Tech' of some of what it is accused of.</p><p>\"Look, we have to be fair. I think Facebook realizes some of its duties and obligations as a platform much better today than they did back in 2016 when the whole thing over Cambridge Analytica broke,\" is how he shoots down my attempt to bash Zuckerberg and co around a bit. Clearly he is not the villainous figure portrayed in some sections of the US media, as some kind of \"free speech killer\" with a chip on his shoulder.</p><p>That being said, even in his final analysis, Chefet fails to see hope for the future of the Internet. By then he has left Dhaka, but I leave a question on his Whatsapp: beyond the big corporations that act like today's \"robber barons\", how did he envision our future relationship with the Internet, arguably the most consequential invention of the last 30 years? Could the inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who has come out and acknowledged the degradation of the internet in relation to its original vision, and pledged to try and save it, even coming up with a program of actions, really do so?</p><p>Chefet's almost instant response is reproduced below in full:</p><p>\"I was already approached by TBL's (Tim Berners-Lee) WebFoundation and you can probably find a reference to AAID and myself on their website. I was one of the first to come out with a statement in support of his Solid Program which is an attempt to get back to the philosophy of the early, decentralised Net. Despite my strong support for this initiative, I'm afraid the battle for the surface web is lost to the Titans. Unfortunately.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

But a quieter source of discontent is also bubbling up: Europe's scientists. The continent of Galileo and Darwin is not about to cast off its glorious heritage. But the boffins have two recent causes for concern. One is a new investment plan devised by the European Commission to kickstart growth, which relies partly on taking ?2.7 billion ($3.4 billion) of money previously devoted to Horizon 2020, the EU's science fund. The Royal Society, an august British scientific body, and others have complained about the money grab.</p><p>The second is over the role of science in European policymaking. Three years ago Anne Glover, a Scottish molecular biologist, became the EU's first chief scientific adviser. She could also be its last. Her mandate expired, along with the previous commission's, and <person><nameText>Jean-Claude Juncker, </nameText></person>the new president, has not seen fit to renew it. Not in office long enough to absorb the diplomatic habits of Brussels insiders, Ms Glover was notably outspoken on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), describing opponents as suffering from \"a form of madness\". That was too much for green NGOs, who called for her head in a letter to Mr Juncker. Some saw in this the seeds of Ms Glover's downfall.</p><p>In fact Mr Juncker's commission has given greens little cause for cheer in the six weeks it has been in office. Only this week it infuriated them by shelving two long-planned environmental proposals. Ms Glover's troubles had more to do with a struggle to get the attention of EU bureaucrats. Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law, points out that there are many ways to channel scientific advice to politicians beyond creating a single senior adviser. Mr Juncker seems in no hurry to decide how, or whether, to revive the job. There are other priorities, says a spokeswoman, and policymakers are not short of scientific advice. </p><p>Yet even sober-minded observers worry about the signal Ms Glover's departure sends. There are plenty of policy challenges ahead, from synthetic biology to artificial intelligence to the applications of new materials like graphene. And Europe's agonies over GMOs illustrate the problems that arise when science is not well integrated into policymaking. Despite repeated studies finding no risk to human health from the consumption of GMOs, just one such crop (a form of maize) is cultivated in the EU, and in only a handful of countries. Under a new proposal countries will even be able to deny farmers the right to purchase GM seeds that have been approved at pan-European level. It is rare for the EU to return powers to national governments once it has acquired them. But politicians saw no other way to break the impasse. </p><p>Or take data protection, which excites peculiar passion in the European breast. After the NSA scandal erupted in America, the European Parliament passed fierce regulations to enshrine privacy rights that make it hard for medical researchers to use personalised data. The legislation would have been much improved had its drafters heeded scientific advice, says Stephan Kuster of Science Europe, an association of European research groups. (The proposal has yet to become law.) </p><p>Many countries struggle to work out how to ground policy in sound science. But critics have a bigger worry. Europe, they fear, is clinging desperately to old certainties as technological change sweeps past. Some detect signs of this attitude in the tensions between the EU and big tech firms. The European Court of Justice has forced Google to consider removing links to articles at individuals' request. And the European Parliament has passed a non-binding resolution urging the \"unbundling\" of large search engines. This, hints an American official, may have more to do with protecting European incumbents than with competition law.</p><p>Not all the criticism is fair. Data protection and GMOs are not mere technocratic concerns, and the rules for them should not be dispassionately crafted by number-crunchers. Europeans take different views about how their data should be used, or what foods they wish to see in their supermarkets, and politicians should reflect these concerns. Nor is America the libertarian paradise of some imaginations, as Charlemagne, a former resident, can attest. </p><p>Americans are not alone in lamenting EU timidity. Mark Walport, Britain's chief scientific adviser, wrote recently that in Europe the precautionary principle has drifted from \"a holding position pending further evidence to what is now effectively a stop sign\". Moreover, Europe has a serious innovation problem. Politicians routinely travel to California for a sprinkling of Silicon Valley stardust, but rarely act to improve the investment climate at home. Lawmakers celebrate the consumer benefits of apps like Uber, a taxi service, but are loth to amend laws protecting incumbents. France has just become the latest country to clamp down on Uber. Small firms seeking money struggle to find alternatives to lumbering banks (although the commission is working on this). Outside the Nordics no EU country meets the European target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development.</p><p>There is, even so, a good-news story to tell. Europe's cities hum with smart minds and entrepreneurial energy. Startup clusters have emerged from Bratislava to Barcelona, as well as in established hubs like London and Berlin. They will benefit from Mr Juncker's promise to propose legislation to complete the single market for digital services in the first half of 2015. And the EU has improved the way it distributes money to scientists. Of course, more would be nice. Just 7% of the EU budget is devoted to Horizon 2020, against 38% for farm subsidies. Reversing those numbers would surely quieten the doubters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-DR4SRC2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DVS-9X81-DY2R-20H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"989\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Given the routine inaccuracies in traditional media, and their near pervasive refusal to issue corrections and make retractions, the uproar over social media is not about accuracy. If you have any doubts, see how many publications have eliminated the historical venue for making complaints, an ombudsman, which is Potemkin accountability. Recall how the Washington Post refused to correct or retract its PropOrNot piece which attacked this site and other alternative media venues. </p><p>The Post instead issued a bizarre 'We don't stand by the accuracy of our reports' disclaimer, which was ridiculed by the Columbia Journalism Review. Traditional media regularly publish quotes that are factually challenged as part of their fetishization for accuracy. It is hard to see what the beef is about when the source of allegedly inaccurate information discloses his real-world identity, or it is widely known.  By Marshall Auerback, a market analyst and commentator. Produced by Economy for All[1], a project of the Independent Media Institute Donald Trump threatened to close Twitter down a day after the social media giant marked his tweets with a fact-check warning label for the first time. The president followed this threat up with an executive order that would encourage federal regulators to allow tech companies to be held liable for the comments, videos, and other content posted by users on their platforms. As is often the case with this president, his impetuous actions were more than a touch self-serving and legally dubious[2] absent a congressionally legislated regulatory framework. Despite himself, Trump does raise an interesting issue\u2014namely whether and how we should regulate the social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as the search engines (Google, Bing) that disseminate their content. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[3] largely immunizes internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content (in contrast to conventional media). The statute directed the courts to not hold providers liable for removing content, even if the content is constitutionally protected. On the other hand, it doesn't direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enforce anything, which calls into question whether the FCC does in fact have the existing legal authority to regulate social media (see this article[4] by Harold Feld, senior vice president of the think tank Public Knowledge[5], for more elaboration on this point). Nor is it clear that vigorous antitrust remedies via the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would solve the problem, even though FTC Chairman Joe Simons suggested last year[6] that breaking up major technology platforms could be the right remedy to rein in dominant companies and restore competition. In spite of Simons' enthusiasm for undoing past mergers, it is unclear how breaking up the social media behemoths and turning them into smaller entities would automatically produce competition that would simultaneously solve problems like fake news, revenge porn, cyberbullying, or hate speech. In fact, it might produce the opposite result, much as the elimination of the 'fairness doctrine[7]' laid the foundations for the emergence of a multitude of hyper-partisan talk radio shows and later, Fox News. Given the current conditions, the Silicon Valley-based social media giants have rarely had to face consequences for the dissemination of misinformation, or outright distortion (in the form of fake news), and have profited mightily from it. Congress has made various attempts to establish a broader regulatory framework for social media companies over the past few years, in part by imposing existing TV and radio ad regulations on social media companies, introducing privacy legislation in California, as well as having congressional hearings featuring Facebook, Twitter and Google, where their CEOs testified on social media's role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. But an overarching attempt to establish a regulatory framework for social media efforts has seldom found consensus[8] among the power lobbies in Washington, and, consequently, legislative efforts have foundered. As the 2020 elections near, the GOP has little interest in censoring Donald Trump. Likewise, Silicon Valley elites have largely seized control of the Democratic Party's policy-making apparatus, so good luck expecting the Democratic Party to push hard on regulating big tech, especially if their dollars ultimately help to lead the country to a Biden presidency and a congressional supermajority. As things stand today, there's not even a hint of a regulatory impulse in this direction in Joe Biden's camp. As for Donald Trump, he can fulminate all he likes about having Twitter calling into question the veracity of his tweets, but that very conflict is red meat for his base. Trump wants to distract Americans from the awful coronavirus death toll, which recently topped 100,000, civil unrest on the streets of America's major cities, and a deep recession that has put 41 million Americans out of work. A war with Twitter is right out of his usual political playbook. By the same token, social media companies cannot solve this problem simply by making themselves the final arbiter of fact-checking, as opposed to an independent regulatory body. Twitter attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump looks like a self-serving attempt to forestall a more substantial regulatory effort. Even under the generous assumption that social media giants had the financial resources, knowledge, or people to do this correctly, as a general principle, it is not a good idea to let the principal actors of an industry regulate themselves, especially when that arbiter is effectively one person, as is the case at Facebook. As Atlantic columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote[9] recently, 'Facebook's young CEO is an emperor of information who decides rules of amplification and access to speech for billions of people, simply due to the way ownership of Facebook shares are structured[10]: Zuckerberg personally controls 60 percent of the voting power.' At least Zuckerberg (unlike Twitter's Jack Dorsey) has personally acknowledged[11] that 'Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.' One thing we can quickly dismiss is a revival of the old fairness doctrine[12], which, until its abolition in 1987, required any media companies holding FCC-broadcast licenses to allow the airing of opposing views on controversial issues of public importance. That doctrine first came under challenge in 1969 on First Amendment grounds in the case of Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission. Dylan Matthews explained in the Washington Post that[13] '[t]he Court ruled unanimously that while broadcasters have First Amendment speech rights, the fact that the spectrum is owned by the government and merely leased to broadcasters gives the FCC the right to regulate news content.' In theory, the idea that the broadcast spectrum is still owned by the government and merely 'leased' to private media could arguably be extended to the internet broadband spectrum, so that social media companies and digital platforms, like broadcast media companies, would have to abide by a range of public interest obligations, some of which may infringe upon their First Amendment freedoms. 'However,' Matthews went on to point out, 'First Amendment jurisprudence after Red Lion started to allow more speech rights to broadcasters, and put the constitutionality of the Fairness Doctrine in question.' It is unlikely that this would change, especially given the configuration of the Supreme Court led by Justice John Roberts, which has tended to adopt a strongly pro-corporate bias in the majority of its rulings. The FCC still retains some discretion to regulate conventional media on the basis of public interest considerations, but Philip M. Napoli, James R. Shepley Professor of Public Policy in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, has argued that[14] 'the FCC's ability to regulate on behalf of the public interest is in many ways confined to the narrow context of broadcasting.' Consequently, there would likely have to be some reimagination of the FCC's concept of public interest, so as to justify expanding their regulatory remit into the realm of social media. Napoli has suggested that[15]: 'Massive aggregations of [private] user data provide the economic engine for Facebook, Google, and beyond. 'If we understand aggregate user data as a public resource, then just as broadcast licensees must abide by public interest obligations in exchange for the privilege of monetizing the broadcast spectrum, so too should large digital platforms abide by public interest obligations in exchange for the privilege of monetizing our data.' That still would mandate changes being initiated by Congress. As things stand today, existing legal guidelines for digital platforms in the U.S. fall under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[16]. The goal of that legislation was to establish some guidelines for digital platforms in light of the jumble of (often conflicting) pre-existing case law that had arisen well before we had the internet. The legislation broadly immunizes internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content. By contrast, a platform that publishes digitally can still be held liable for its own content, of course. So, a newspaper such as the New York Times or an online publication such as the Daily Beast could still be held liable for one of its own articles online, but not for its comments section. While the quality of public discourse has suffered mightily for the immunity granted by Section 230, the public doesn't have much power to do anything about it. There is, however, a growing coalition of business powers that have bristled for many years at their inability to hold these platforms accountable for the claims made by critics and customers of their products, and to prevent the expansion of Section 230 into international trade agreements, as it had already seeped into parts of the new USMCA agreement with Mexico and Canada. A New York Times story about the fight explained that[17] 'companies' motivations vary somewhat. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.' At this point, it is necessary to be prepared for the sophistication and capacity of business lobbies in Washington to initiate a national controversy like the recent headlines of struggles at Twitter and Facebook with Trump to serve a long-term regulatory goal. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, an advocate of Section 230, argued that[18] 'companies in return for that protection\u2014that they wouldn't be sued indiscriminately\u2014were being responsible in terms of policing their platforms.' In other words, the quid pro quo for such immunity was precisely the kind of moderation that is conspicuously lacking today. However, Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of the book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, suggested[19] there was no quid pro quo in the legislation, noting that '[t]here are countless individuals who are chased offline as a result of cyber mobs and harassment.' In addition to the issues of intimidation or targeted groups cited by Citron, there are additional problems, such as the dissemination of content designed to interfere with the function of democracy (seen in evidence in the 2016 presidential election), that can otherwise disrupt society. This is not a problem unique to the United States. Disinformation was spread during the Brexit referendum, for starters. Another overseas example is featured in a Wall Street Journal article that reported in June, [20]'[a]fter a live stream of a shooting spree at New Zealand mosques last year was posted on Facebook, Australia passed legislation that allows social-media platforms to be fined if they don't remove violent content quickly.' Likewise, Germany passed its NetzDG law[21], which was designed to compel large social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, to block or remove 'manifestly unlawful[22]' content, such as hate speech, 'within 24 hours of receiving a complaint but have up to one week or potentially more if further investigation is required,' according to an analysis of the law written by Human Rights Watch[23]. It is unclear whether Section 230 confers similar obligations in the U.S. Given this ambiguity, many still argue that the immunity conferred by Section 230 is too broad. Last year, Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act[24], the aim being to narrow the scope of immunity conferred on large social media companies by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The stated goal[25] of the legislation was to compel these companies to 'submit to an external audit that proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral.' Under Hawley's proposals, for example, Google or Bing would not be allowed to arbitrarily limit the range of political ideology available. The proposed legislation would also require the FTC to examine the algorithms as a condition of continuing to give these companies immunity under Section 230. Any change in the search engine algorithm would require pre-clearance from the FTC. Hawley's proposal would fundamentally alter business models of social media companies that today depend on huge volumes of user-generated content. But it certainly will not solve the problem of fake news, which has emerged as an increasingly controversial flashpoint in the discussion on how to regulate social media. The problem with Hawley's proposal is that it could potentially require digital platforms to engage in further content moderation. Ironically, then, efforts to retain the platform's political neutrality could well create disincentives against moderation and in fact encourage platforms to err on the side of extremism (which might inadvertently include the dissemination of misinformation). Public Knowledge[26]'s Harold Feld noted that[27] Section 230 does not exempt the application of federal or state criminal laws, such as sex trafficking or illegal drugs, with respect to third-party content protection. But he recognized that it by no means constitutes a complete solution to the problems raised here. In his book The Case for the Digital Platform Act[28], he proposes that Congress create a new agency with permanent oversight jurisdiction over social media. Such an agency could 'monitor the impact of a law over time, and mitigate impacts from a law that turns out to be too harsh in practice, or creates uncertainty, or otherwise has negative unintended consequences.' To maintain ample flexibility and democratic legitimacy, Feld proposed that the agency have the 'capacity to report to Congress on the need to amend legislation in light of unfolding developments.' Regulating the free-for-all on social media is unlikely to circumscribe our civil liberties or democracy one way or another, so the First Amendment enthusiasts can breathe easy. The experiment in letting anybody say whatever he/she wants, true or false, and be heard instantly around the world at the push of a button has done less to serve the cause of free speech, or enhance the quality of journalism, than it has to turn a few social media entrepreneurs into multi-hundred millionaires or billionaires. We managed to have the civil rights revolution even though radio and TV and Hollywood were regulated, so there is no reason to think that a more robust series of regulations of social media will throw us back into the political dark ages or stifle free expression. Even with the dawn of the internet era, major journalistic exposes have largely emerged from traditional newspapers and magazines, online publications such as the Huffington Post, or curated blogs, not random tweets, or Facebook posts. Congress should call Trump's bluff on social media, by crafting regulation appropriate for the 21st century. That may have to wait until after the 2020 election, but it is a problem that won't go away.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/06/the-battle-over-free-speech-online-is-a-volcano-thats-ready-to-blow.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/06/the-battle-over-free-speech-online-is-a-volcano-thats-ready-to-blow.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[29], Guest Post[30], Legal[31], Media watch[32], Politics[33] on June 4, 2020[34] by Yves Smith[35].

The president followed this threat up with an executive order that would encourage federal regulators to allow tech companies to be held liable for the comments, videos, and other content posted by users on their platforms. As is often the case with this president, his impetuous actions were more than a touch self-serving and legally dubious absent a congressionally legislated regulatory framework.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite himself, Trump does raise an interesting issue-namely whether and how we should regulate the social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as the search engines (Google, Bing) that disseminate their content. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act largely immunizes internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content (in contrast to conventional media).</p><p>The statute directed the courts to not hold providers liable for removing content, even if the content is constitutionally protected. On the other hand, it doesn't direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enforce anything, which calls into question whether the FCC does in fact have the existing legal authority to regulate social media (see this article by Harold Feld, senior vice president of the think tank Public Knowledge, for more elaboration on this point). Nor is it clear that vigorous antitrust remedies via the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would solve the problem, even though FTC Chairman Joe Simons suggested last year that breaking up major technology platforms could be the right remedy to rein in dominant companies and restore competition.</p><p>In spite of Simons' enthusiasm for undoing past mergers, it is unclear how breaking up the social media behemoths and turning them into smaller entities would automatically produce competition that would simultaneously solve problems like fake news, revenge porn, cyberbullying, or hate speech. In fact, it might produce the opposite result, much as the elimination of the 'fairness doctrine' laid the foundations for the emergence of a multitude of hyper-partisan talk radio shows and later, Fox News.</p><p>Given the current conditions, the Silicon Valley-based social media giants have rarely had to face consequences for the dissemination of misinformation, or outright distortion (in the form of fake news), and have profited mightily from it.</p><p>Congress has made various attempts to establish a broader regulatory framework for social media companies over the past few years, in part by imposing existing TV and radio ad regulations on social media companies, introducing privacy legislation in California, as well as having congressional hearings featuring Facebook, Twitter and Google, where their CEOs testified on social media's role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. But an overarching attempt to establish a regulatory framework for social media efforts has seldom found consensus among the power lobbies in Washington, and, consequently, legislative efforts have foundered.</p><p>As the 2020 elections near, the GOP has little interest in censoring Donald Trump. Likewise, Silicon Valley elites have largely seized control of the Democratic Party's policy-making apparatus, so good luck expecting the Democratic Party to push hard on regulating big tech, especially if their dollars ultimately help to lead the country to a Biden presidency and a congressional supermajority. As things stand today, there's not even a hint of a regulatory impulse in this direction in Joe Biden's camp. As for Donald Trump, he can fulminate all he likes about having Twitter calling into question the veracity of his tweets, but that very conflict is red meat for his base. Trump wants to distract Americans from the awful coronavirus death toll, which recently topped 100,000, civil unrest on the streets of America's major cities, and a deep recession that has put 41 million Americans out of work. A war with Twitter is right out of his usual political playbook.</p><p>By the same token, social media companies cannot solve this problem simply by making themselves the final arbiter of fact-checking, as opposed to an independent regulatory body. Twitter attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump looks like a self-serving attempt to forestall a more substantial regulatory effort. Even under the generous assumption that social media giants had the financial resources, knowledge, or people to do this correctly, as a general principle, it is not a good idea to let the principal actors of an industry regulate themselves, especially when that arbiter is effectively one person, as is the case at Facebook. As Atlantic columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote recently, 'Facebook's young CEO is an emperor of information who decides rules of amplification and access to speech for billions of people, simply due to the way ownership of Facebook shares are structured: Zuckerberg personally controls 60 percent of the voting power.' At least Zuckerberg (unlike Twitter's Jack Dorsey) has personally acknowledged that 'Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online\u2026 Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'</p><p>One thing we can quickly dismiss is a revival of the old fairness doctrine, which, until its abolition in 1987, required any media companies holding FCC-broadcast licenses to allow the airing of opposing views on controversial issues of public importance. That doctrine first came under challenge in 1969 on First Amendment grounds in the case of Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission. Dylan Matthews explained in the Washington Post that '[t]he Court ruled unanimously that while broadcasters have First Amendment speech rights, the fact that the spectrum is owned by the government and merely leased to broadcasters gives the FCC the right to regulate news content.' In theory, the idea that the broadcast spectrum is still owned by the government and merely 'leased' to private media could arguably be extended to the internet broadband spectrum, so that social media companies and digital platforms, like broadcast media companies, would have to abide by a range of public interest obligations, some of which may infringe upon their First Amendment freedoms. 'However,' Matthews went on to point out, 'First Amendment jurisprudence after Red Lion started to allow more speech rights to broadcasters, and put the constitutionality of the Fairness Doctrine in question.' It is unlikely that this would change, especially given the configuration of the Supreme Court led by Justice John Roberts, which has tended to adopt a strongly pro-corporate bias in the majority of its rulings.</p><p>The FCC still retains some discretion to regulate conventional media on the basis of public interest considerations, but Philip M. Napoli, James R. Shepley Professor of Public Policy in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, has argued that 'the FCC's ability to regulate on behalf of the public interest is in many ways confined to the narrow context of broadcasting.'</p><p>Consequently, there would likely have to be some reimagination of the FCC's concept of public interest, so as to justify expanding their regulatory remit into the realm of social media. Napoli has suggested that:</p><p>'Massive aggregations of [private] user data provide the economic engine for Facebook, Google, and beyond.\u2026</p><p>'If we understand aggregate user data as a public resource, then just as broadcast licensees must abide by public interest obligations in exchange for the privilege of monetizing the broadcast spectrum, so too should large digital platforms abide by public interest obligations in exchange for the privilege of monetizing our data.'</p><p>That still would mandate changes being initiated by Congress. As things stand today, existing legal guidelines for digital platforms in the U.S. fall under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The goal of that legislation was to establish some guidelines for digital platforms in light of the jumble of (often conflicting) pre-existing case law that had arisen well before we had the internet. The legislation broadly immunizes internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content. By contrast, a platform that publishes digitally can still be held liable for its own content, of course. So, a newspaper such as the New York Times or an online publication such as the Daily Beast could still be held liable for one of its own articles online, but not for its comments section.</p><p>While the quality of public discourse has suffered mightily for the immunity granted by Section 230, the public doesn't have much power to do anything about it. There is, however, a growing coalition of business powers that have bristled for many years at their inability to hold these platforms accountable for the claims made by critics and customers of their products, and to prevent the expansion of Section 230 into international trade agreements, as it had already seeped into parts of the new USMCA agreement with Mexico and Canada. A New York Times story about the fight explained that 'companies' motivations vary somewhat. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.' At this point, it is necessary to be prepared for the sophistication and capacity of business lobbies in Washington to initiate a national controversy like the recent headlines of struggles at Twitter and Facebook with Trump to serve a long-term regulatory goal.</p><p>Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, an advocate of Section 230, argued that 'companies in return for that protection-that they wouldn't be sued indiscriminately-were being responsible in terms of policing their platforms.' In other words, the quid pro quo for such immunity was precisely the kind of moderation that is conspicuously lacking today. However, Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of the book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, suggested there was no quid pro quo in the legislation, noting that '[t]here are countless individuals who are chased offline as a result of cyber mobs and harassment.'</p><p>In addition to the issues of intimidation or targeted groups cited by Citron, there are additional problems, such as the dissemination of content designed to interfere with the function of democracy (seen in evidence in the 2016 presidential election), that can otherwise disrupt society. This is not a problem unique to the United States. Disinformation was spread during the Brexit referendum, for starters. Another overseas example is featured in a Wall Street Journal article that reported in June, '[a]fter a live stream of a shooting spree at New Zealand mosques last year was posted on Facebook, Australia passed legislation that allows social-media platforms to be fined if they don't remove violent content quickly.' Likewise, Germany passed its NetzDG law, which was designed to compel large social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, to block or remove 'manifestly unlawful' content, such as hate speech, 'within 24 hours of receiving a complaint but have up to one week or potentially more if further investigation is required,' according to an analysis of the law written by Human Rights Watch.</p><p>It is unclear whether Section 230 confers similar obligations in the U.S.</p><p>Given this ambiguity, many still argue that the immunity conferred by Section 230 is too broad. Last year, Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, the aim being to narrow the scope of immunity conferred on large social media companies by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The stated goal of the legislation was to compel these companies to 'submit to an external audit that proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral.'</p><p>Under Hawley's proposals, for example, Google or Bing would not be allowed to arbitrarily limit the range of political ideology available. The proposed legislation would also require the FTC to examine the algorithms as a condition of continuing to give these companies immunity under Section 230. Any change in the search engine algorithm would require pre-clearance from the FTC.</p><p>Hawley's proposal would fundamentally alter business models of social media companies that today depend on huge volumes of user-generated content. But it certainly will not solve the problem of fake news, which has emerged as an increasingly controversial flashpoint in the discussion on how to regulate social media. The problem with Hawley's proposal is that it could potentially require digital platforms to engage in further content moderation. Ironically, then, efforts to retain the platform's political neutrality could well create disincentives against moderation and in fact encourage platforms to err on the side of extremism (which might inadvertently include the dissemination of misinformation).</p><p>Public Knowledge's Harold Feld noted that Section 230 does not exempt the application of federal or state criminal laws, such as sex trafficking or illegal drugs, with respect to third-party content protection. But he recognized that it by no means constitutes a complete solution to the problems raised here. In his book The Case for the Digital Platform Act, he proposes that Congress create a new agency with permanent oversight jurisdiction over social media. Such an agency could 'monitor the impact of a law over time, and\u2026 mitigate impacts from a law that turns out to be too harsh in practice, or creates uncertainty, or otherwise has negative unintended consequences.' To maintain ample flexibility and democratic legitimacy, Feld proposed that the agency have the 'capacity to report to Congress on the need to amend legislation in light of unfolding developments.'</p><p>Regulating the free-for-all on social media is unlikely to circumscribe our civil liberties or democracy one way or another, so the First Amendment enthusiasts can breathe easy. The experiment in letting anybody say whatever he/she wants, true or false, and be heard instantly around the world at the push of a button has done less to serve the cause of free speech, or enhance the quality of journalism, than it has to turn a few social media entrepreneurs into multi-hundred millionaires or billionaires.</p><p>We managed to have the civil rights revolution even though radio and TV and Hollywood were regulated, so there is no reason to think that a more robust series of regulations of social media will throw us back into the political dark ages or stifle free expression. Even with the dawn of the internet era, major journalistic exposes have largely emerged from traditional newspapers and magazines, online publications such as the Huffington Post, or curated blogs, not random tweets, or Facebook posts.

There are a lot of deals happening around these parts lately, with a record amount of money changing hands.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through mid-November, there were just over 400 completed and pending mergers and acquisitions targeting Massachusetts-based companies this year, worth a total of $100 billion, according to the finance software firm Dealogic. That's the highest combined deal value on record. There's a good chance the number of deals will surpass last year's total of 426, but the level of activity is already higher than it was in the years immediately preceding the recent recession and 2008 credit-market implosion, according to Dealogic. And while megadeals such as Dell's pending $67 billion buyout of EMC Corp. have hogged the spotlight, the frenzy has infected companies of all sizes, in all sorts of industries across the state, according to lawyers and investment bankers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what's fueled the boom? A big part of it is cheap credit and the improved economy, both nationally and locally. At the same time, an increasingly onerous tax and regulatory climate has compelled a number of U.S. companies, particularly in the life sciences sector, to seek foreign buyers domiciled in more favorable tax environments.</p><p>But there's another, darker factor: A fear that, while the good times won't stop completely, they have peaked, and we're starting to come down the other side of the mountain.</p><p>In other words, companies are looking to get their dealmaking done while the gettin's still good.</p><p>For now, buyers have plenty of cash on hand to finance M&amp;A activity, putting all of that post-recession penny-pinching to good use. The private equity space is intensely competitive, driving up both valuations and dealmaking. Interest rates are still in the basement, making loans attractive.</p><p>\"The stars are really aligning here,\" said Mary-Laura Greely, a Pierce Atwood LLPattorney who advises clients on mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>The good times aren't expected to last. The Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates in December. Even a tiny bump could have a big effect. \"The interest rate increases are going to be quite small in terms of historical norms, but from a psychological standpoint, any time someone whispers (about a raise), you can see what the markets are doing,\" said Tim Maguire, another Pierce Atwood lawyer.</p><p>The recent slowdowns in Europe and China have many worried about ripple effects here in the U.S. The terror attacks in Paris this month only have added to the uncertainty surrounding the global economic climate, experts said.</p><p>There are early signs that M&amp;A activity is beginning to slow down in Massachusetts. While the deal value exploded with the EMC-Dell merger announcement, the number of deals in the state fell by almost 40 percent from the second to the third quarter, according to data from Mergermarket. The investment banking firm Covington Associates has had a few of its clients' deals this autumn fall through, managing director Tom Cibotti said.</p><p>\"We were gangbusters through August, but a couple significant transactions have gone off the rails,\" he said. \"We've seen a couple of instances where forecasts aren't being achieved.</p><p>\"As we head into 2016, it's hard to argue that things will only continue upward,\" Cibotti added. \"I think there's still a lot of excess capital that will continue to keep the market relatively strong ... but there's going to be more caution put into dealmaking.\"</p><p> Commercial real estate's shifting terrain<br/></p><p>The commercial real estate sector has been no stranger to consolidation during the past decade, but the past year brought a tidal wave of change to the local landscape with two major deals. The first was Chicago-based DTZ's $2 billion buyout of New York-based Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which has led to a bloodletting of Cushman leadership both nationally and locally, with Boston head Luis Alvarado leaving and former head of research for the Americas Maria Sicola suing the brokerage for gender discrimination. The merger also forced the move of New England power broker Robert E. Griffin Jr. and his 70-person crew from Cushman's Boston office in favor of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank. Joe Fallon, formerly of DTZ, Cassidy Turley and FHO Partners, replaced Alvarado as New England market leader.</p><p>Meanwhile, New York-based investment manager The Blackstone Group continued its dominating run to become one of - if not the - largest owners of real estate in the U.S. with its $8 billion acquisition of San Diego, California-based life science real estate investment trust BioMed Realty Trust. With a 3.4 million-square-foot portfolio in Boston and Cambridge, BioMed is among the largest owners of life sciences-focused real estate in the region. Some 2.5 million square feet of BioMed's local portfolio is located in Cambridge's Kendall Square.</p><p>The deals come at a time of continued high-level, high-profile, high-dollar-value transactions throughout the region. Blackstone recently worked a deal to sell 500 Boylston St. and 222 Berkeley St. in Boston's Back Bay to JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Oxford Properties Group for $1.3 billion, a deal valued at more than $1,000 per square foot. That deal follows last year's $2.1 billion sale of five area properties, including the Microsoft New England R&amp;D Center at One Memorial Dr. in Kendall Square, a deal which also came in at a price of more than $1,000 per square foot.</p><p>- Catherine Carlock</p><p> Economic upheaval in the life sciences<br/></p><p>Count New York's Pfizer - the second-biggest drugmaker in the United States - among the major biotechs seeking a more tax-friendly climate abroad with its pending $150 billion deal to acquire Dublin-based Allergan. Should the deal come to pass, it would mark the latest example of a major U.S. corporation openly eschewing the onerous tax and regulatory climates bearing down on employers, particularly ones working in drug development and medical devices. Last year's $43 billion buyout involving Medtronic and Covidien, which is based in Ireland but operates out of Mansfield, Massachusetts, is among the largest of the so-called tax-inversion deals to date.</p><p>But dealmaking is frothy throughout the industry, regardless of tax consequences. Shire Pharmaceuticals' potential acquisition of Baxalta is potentially the biggest of the bunch. While neither is technically based in Massachusetts, they both have major presences here. Shire is based in Ireland and registered in Jersey (in the U.K.) for tax purposes, but most of its executives and its largest-single concentration of employees are in Lexington. Illinois-based Baxalta opened a 500-employee R&amp;D facility in Kendall Square this summer. Baxalta rebuffed a $30 billion offer in September, but Shire CEO Fleming Ornskov has said he's still hoping to complete the deal.</p><p>Shire has been particularly active since its $55 billion bid to acquire AbbVie fell through last year. It recently agreed to pay $5.9 billion for Burlington-based Dyax Corp., a deal announced in November. That news came roughly a year after Shire bought a New Jersey biotech, NPS Pharma, for $5.2 billion.</p><p>But amid all the billions of dollars involved in biotech acquisitions, one recent deal serves to show that shareholders aren't necessarily warming to the trend. Directors at Ocata, a Marlborough-based biotech working on stem cell treatments for causes of blindness, have accepted a $379 million bid from Japanese drugmaker Astellas, which represents a 79 percent premium to the company's stock price. But many shareholders are far from on board, arguing the price doesn't reflect the company's true worth and that any acquisition should wait until after key trial data expected next year.</p><p>- Don Seiffert</p><p> Big tech's deal of the century<br/></p><p>The largest tech-sector takeover in history is underway right here in the Bay State, following October's news that Texas computer maker Dell Inc. has agreed to buy Hopkinton-based data storage giant EMC Corp. for $67 billion, or $33.15 per share.</p><p>While the deal isn't yet complete, the fact that EMC could be taken private will have a wide-ranging impact on publicly traded technology companies looking to restructure without having the pressure of reporting profits to shareholders.</p><p>\"Everyone's on the table now,\" said Chris Bulger, founder of Boston-based Bulger Partners, a tech and software-focused investment bank and advisory firm.</p><p>The second high-profile tech acquisition this year was Burlington-based web hosting company Endurance International Group Holdings Inc.'s decision to acquire Waltham-based online marketing firmConstant Contact Inc. in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. Both of those tech firms are public. As part of the deal, Endurance will acquire all of Constant Contact's outstanding shares of common stock for $32 per share in cash.</p><p>The combined company will serve more than 5 million small businesses and nonprofits and have combined revenue of more than $1 billion.</p><p>M&amp;A activity is up in 2015 for several reasons, Bulger said. First, there's upwards of $400 billion of capital sitting at private equity firms around the country, ready to be disbursed in the form of mergers and acquisitions. That's up by about 30 percent compared to 2014.</p><p>Private equity firms are playing a big role in mergers, Bulger said. For every one strategic corporation bidding on a company, there's another four or five private equity firms bidding for that same company, Bulger said.</p><p>\"Because of that, the speed of the deal and the time it takes to get a deal done has been cut by about 70 percent over the past year,\" Bulger said. The time to close a deal has been cut from months to days, he said, which could also be another reason activity is up.</p><p>Other notable tech acquisitions this year have included a $68 million deal that will see Rapid7, a Boston-based cybersecurity firm, acquire Boston-based Logentries, and London-based Reward Gateway, which was acquired by Boston-based private equity firm Great Hill Partners in a deal valued at $217.6 million.</p><p>- Sara Castellanos</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Winnie Mandela, a furious, passionate and unrepentant fighter was 81.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That`s all for \"MTP Daily.\" THE BEAT starts now with Stephanie Ruhle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, Steph.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC HOST: Hello, my friend, Katy Tur. What a beautiful tribute.</p><p>Thank you so much for tuning in. I`m Stephanie Ruhle in for my friend Ari Melber tonight.</p><p>And we are starting by asking a question. Is President Trump rolling out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin? The Kremlin now revealing that Trump suggested a meeting with Putin at the White House when they spoke by phone last month. The White House then seem to confirm the report, saying Trump already told reports he and Putin discussed having a meeting in the not so distant future. And it could be at a number of venues, one could be the White House.</p><p>But President Trump, he didn`t say anything about location.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory. The call had to do, also, with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distant future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: Remember, even that congratulatory call raised serious questions from both Republicans and Democrats. Here is the question. Why would President Trump want to reward Vladimir Putin with a White House visit after, of course, the election hack and the poisoning of a former spy in England. And why did we first learn about this from Russians? Even some of the President staunchest defenders can`t explain his attitude towards Putin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I think the problem is that Russia is running wild. Whatever we`re doing is not working and the President for some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: So even if you think there`s no money laundering. Even if you think there`s no collusion, why? Why is President Trump so intent on being so nice to Vladimir Putin?</p><p>We will have a great panel to help weigh in on all of this. Max Boot a senior at the counsel of foreign relations and a columnist for \"the Washington Post,\" Ned Price, former spokesperson for the national security council and my friend Bill Kristol, founder and editor-at-large for \"the Weekly Standard.\"</p><p>Max, to you first, why is a Putin meeting a big deal? You who really understands this could be losing your mind over. But the average person at home could say who cares? They meets world leaders all the time.</p><p>MAX BOOT, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Remember, Putin is not a good guy. I mean, he is committing aggression against the west on a daily basis. He is invading Ukraine as we speak. He is committing war crimes in Syria. He just used a very exotic nerve agent to try to kill two people in Great Britain, our ally.</p><p>And so the proper policy of the United States is to tell Putin you can`t get away with this. We are going to make you pay a price. We are going to stand with our allies against this kind of aggression.</p><p>And there are people in the U.S. government who are trying to send that message, like for example, pushing for the expulsion of Russian diplomats. But at every turn, Trump is undercutting that (INAUDIBLE) on Russia message because he can`t help himself. He just loves Putin too much. And so, you know, his national security council says in big block letters, do not congratulate Putin on his rigged reelection, and Trump can`t help himself, he has to congratulate Putin. And of course, it probably didn`t occur to them to say, don`t invite Putin to the White House, because this is a favor that you roll out for the leaders that you are trying to woo. And we should be wooing Vladimir Putin. But this, you know, Trump has a mind of his own when it comes to Putin.</p><p>RUHLE: But Trump has always made the argument, Bill Kristol, I`m going to try something different. Could he make the argument, inviting Putin over for a playdate is a good strategy? I mean, the playdate is the only way I can think of it. You should not reward a hostile power with an invite. But he is saying come on over.</p><p>BOOT: I think he needs a time out instead of a playdate.</p><p>RUHLE: Bill?</p><p>BILL KRISTOL, FOUNDER/EDITOR-AT-LARGE, WEEKLY STANDARD: Conservatives and hawks, like Max and me, they were critical of the Bush administration that many times the Obama administration (INAUDIBLE) for being too soft on Putin, for not making him pay much of consequence for the things he did, whether it was invading Ukraine or much later, of course, try to tamper to say the least with our electoral process and now poisoning someone on UK soil, on British soil as a message to others. Don`t mess with us. You are not safe. That was a very important thing. It`s been underappreciated. How devastating.</p><p>I mean, if he gets away with that, if they pay no price for that, what Russian emigre, what dissident, what person speaking up against Russia, not even a Russian perhaps is going to feel entirely safe. So that is the newly, the kind of amazing form of aggression to do that, to do with the bad chemical agent.</p><p>I mean, the idea that the President of the United States, the head of the alliance of which Britain is such an important part, just invites Putin over to the White House, what, in weeks of that happening. I mean, it really is a shocking weakness in American foreign policy.</p><p>I`m just reading John Bolton who is going to be the president`s national security advisor, attacking the Obama administration for being too weak on Putin. I agree with some of those attacks. And now he is going to become national security advisor to our president who has gone how much further than President Obama did in not responding or affirmatively undercutting any attempts to respond to Putin`s aggression.</p><p>RUHLE: We can`t seem to figure out why the President is so complementary or at least not tough on Russia and Putin.</p><p>Ned, why does it matter that we keep learning about this stuff from Russians? Is it that the White House is keeping secrets? Or let`s be honest. We know this White House is not organized. At very best, the communication team has limited information. John Kelly is not on all the calls, and they are playing defense all day long.</p><p>NED PRICE, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Steph, it`s not just a messaging issue. This is and actual substantive issue, and it provides, really, a source of leverage to the Russians that they have consistently provided the official account, the readout of these meetings or phone calls, hours in some cases before the White House has done so.</p><p>Look, in this case, what`s important is had this close Putin aide, (INAUDIBLE) not made THIS comment, we may not have learned of this invitation. And the timing of this comment from the Kremlin aide is interesting. There`s reason to believe to think that it may have been made to embarrass President Trump. Of course this revelation comes just days after President Trump and some of our European allies together expelled 60 Russian spies from our country alone, with dozens mosh from Europe.</p><p>And so, we have been so fixated on this issue of leverage in the sense of compromise - when it comes to personal leverage or financial leverage in Trump`s longstanding desire to do business with the Russians.</p><p>But we have forgotten the fact that Donald Trump routinely has given our allies and adversaries alike, additional points of leverage. And this is one of those points of leverage. The Russians rolled this out according to their schedule in an effort to embarrass him.</p><p>For example, let`s assume that the \"Washington Post\" hadn`t reported last spring that Trump had called Comey a nut-job no the oval office. If they had kept that and rolled that out according to their own timing, that, too, would have been a source of leverage. And so, the question becomes how many other sources, how many other points of leverage are out there that we just don`t know about, that President Trump has doled out to our friends and I think most worrisome, to our foes.</p><p>RUHLE: How about a different kind of leverage? Robert Mueller`s leverage.</p><p>Max, we know that the Mueller investigation is getting broader and deeper. Could that be motivating Donald Trump in his behavior and his actions here? I mean, when I watch, you know, defenders of the president continue to grab a Robert Mueller, saying they brought him into soon. He is a Democrats. But let`s back this up.</p><p>This is guy, a Republican who is, who ran the FBI. I want to say ran the FBI, has a purple heart, is Ivy League educated. I scratch my head when they continue to go after this guy. What is it?</p><p>BOOT: Well, mean, it`s the old adage that, you know, if you can`t beat the case in court you have to beat the table. And they are beating the table right now. They are trying to discredit Robert Mueller, because clearly Donald Trump is terrified of what Mueller is going to come up with. And of course, what Mueller is looking at is the nature of this very strange relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.</p><p>We know that there`s been a lot of smoke out there, a lot of stuff has already come out. There is already a circumstantial case of collusion. There is a more than circumstantial case that Trump has committed obstruction of justice. And so, of course, they are trying to beat up the prosecutor and soften him up ultimately. And that -- what this might be leading to, of course, is an attempt by Trump either fire Mueller or to get rid of sessions or Rosenstein and (INAUDIBLE), the scale of the Mueller probe or whatever is going on. Donald Trump is clearly worried. And yet, this is what makes his outreach to Putin all the more bizarre. Trump`s own interest to appear tough on Putin.</p><p>RUHLE: This is where I don`t get.</p><p>BOOT: The more that he invites Putin for a playdate at the White House the more he gives fodder to this impression that there is something nefarious about his relationship. And yet he keeps on doing it, which makes you wonder, is he afraid of what Vladimir Putin has on him as Ned Price does suggested.</p><p>RUHLE: Bill, can you comment on that? Because that is what I don`t get. They beat Mueller up, right, left and center, but it doesn`t stick, because the guy has a stellar reputation, and Trump continues to do things that make you scratch your head saying, yes, guess you really do like those Russians.</p><p>KRISTOL: Right. Well, yes, maybe on that. I think look. If I were in Trump`s shoes, I think he thinks that Mueller may find stuff that Trump is not wanting to find whether it is an impeachable offensive or no. And he is trying to discredit the investigator. It`s the O.J. defense, if you can`t beat the rap on the merits, you discredit the investigators, you create enough confusion about the investigators, you create reasonable doubt for the least the people who want to believe you can stick with you. And that, Trump has succeed in doing.</p><p>Mueller is still, thank God, more popular than Trump as polls the other day. I think Mueller needs some help and I think some of us will try to make the case for Mueller. Someone we should believe. We should let the investigation go.</p><p>But it`s not as if Republicans on the hill are rising up steadfastly saying that Mueller shouldn`t be fired. That no one should be pardoned. Trump is systematically laying the basis for either trying to get rid of Mueller and or parting people because he is scared of this probe. I think he knows what he is doing. We may say it is bad if you are to do this. He also has the sense that, you know, boldness pays off, maybe. If he has Putin here and there`s no huge reaction, if people from Congress come and eat with Putin, it just seems like this is as normal. And if he gets away with that, that is another step in the (INAUDIBLE) of everything. And it makes people like us who are saying, well, there is something deeply perhaps and proper about this relationship. And it does look like the ones who are crying Wolf. So I think Trump, in a way, knows what he is doing.</p><p>RUHLE: That`s a great point. We could say he doesn`t know what he is doing. We can call it buffoonery all day long, but that guy`s sitting in the White House. He has got some sort of strategy working.</p><p>We are going to talk about another new development in the Mueller probe tonight. There is new reports of Robert Mueller examining former Trump adviser Roger Stone`s contacts with WikiLeaks. The \"Wall Street Journal\" learning Stone wrote an email in August of 2016 to former Trump advisor Sam Nunberg, a favorite of this specific television show claiming he dined with Julian Assange last night. Sam claims that email was a joke and he denied ever meeting Assange. If that was a joke, where was the punch line?</p><p>But last week on this very show, as I mentioned, Nunberg, he`s a regular, he said he didn`t think Stone was joking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM NUNBERG, TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE: I think he will just say, look - he won`t say he was lying. He will say I was joking as he sign. I mean, the joke is essentially on me, because that`s why he got called in. I think one of the primary reasons by Muller`s special counsel.</p><p>ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: Was it a joke?</p><p>NUNBERG: I don`t -- that`s not the way I recollect it. That`s not the way I recall it.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a no?</p><p>NUNBERG: Was it a joke to me that he --?</p><p>MELBER: Was it a joke? Yes or no.</p><p>NUNBERG: I didn`t think it was a joke.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: He didn`t think it was a joke. And remember, Sam Nunberg, a massive defender of Roger Stone.</p><p>Shelby Holliday broke that story for \"the Wall Street Journal.\" Great piece. Congratulations.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thank you.</p><p>RUHLE: Walk as through this. I mean, what is Mueller`s team looking for behind this email?</p><p>HOLLIDAY: Well, it shows how they have to sort through the complexities of emails that may or may not be true. We saw the email. We don`t have it in our possession. But Roger Stone sent an email on August 4th saying he dined with Julian Assange on August 3rd. When we approached Roger and asked him for comment on this. He sent us what appear to be a flight booking. There`s no way for us to verify it. And Delta won`t verify ii. But it showed him being in L.A. and traveling to Miami. So there are lot of question. Obviously, you would have to go to London if you are going to dine with Julian Assange.</p><p>I have been talking to some prosecutors once that dining doesn`t necessarily mean simply being there. Maybe he caught him on the phone during dinner. Maybe they did --.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOLLIDAY: Prosecutors say there`s no fine print there dinning and that means --.</p><p>RUHLE: If I had dinner, if I dined with you last night, it means we broke bread, it means salad, soup, appetizer, I mean, are you kidding?</p><p>HOLLIDAY: So right. So the big question is was he in London? And there has not been any sort of prove. We can`t see the flight records. Delta, for privacy reasons, won`t tell us whether he was actually on this flight he said he was on.</p><p>But the big picture here is if you look at the timeline, this email came just days after President Trump called on Russia to find Clinton`s missing emails. And it also came days after reported contacts between Manafort, who is a longtime friend and business associate of Roger Stone, Manafort`s contact with Konstantin Kiliminik (ph) who the special counsel`s hinted this weeks as who had ties to Russian intelligence in 2016.</p><p>And days after this, actually the next day after the email, Roger Stone praised Julian Assange on WikiLeaks and continued to do so over the next few months, predicting that it would be Podesta`s time in the barrel. And by the way, for that tweet, he said he meant their work showing up in the panama papers which were published earlier in 2016.</p><p>RUHLE: You can`t make this up.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: You can`t make it up. And Roger Stone has an excuse for everything. But it is just really hard to parse the truth here. And I think that probably shows how difficult it might be for the special counsel`s office. They obviously know more than we do. But it can be difficult when you are looking at statements. You are not sure if they are true.</p><p>RUHLE: Max, what do you make of this? And do you want to dine with me over the phone?</p><p>BOOT: Absolutely, that will be a new experience, virtual dining.</p><p>Look. I mean, from the outside I looks, it seems to me, and again, we don`t know everything that Robert Mueller knows and he consistently surprises us time after time with new indictments and new information. But even based on what we know, it seems like there is a pretty compelling case of collusion which is being put together here of which this latest information about Roger Stone is just one of the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>I mean, we also know, by the way, that Roger Stone talked of Guccifer 2.0, there was a Russian intelligence agent. We know that were more than 70 contacts in 2016 between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. We know that George Papadopoulos, who was a Trump foreign policy adviser knew in advance about the stolen Russian emails from the DNC. It certainly looks like Roger Stone knew in advance about some of these stolen email that were going to be leaked out.</p><p>You can argue about anyone piece of the puzzle and you know, you can have an argument of who was dining with whom or whatever. But when you look at the whole smorgasbord, it adds up to a pretty damning picture, I would say, that it is going to be fascinating to see what, you know, what Robert Mueller makes of it because to me, it seems pretty darn incriminated.</p><p>RUHLE: A real smorgasbord, not a virtual one. This whole story, it makes me feel bad for political and crime novelists. Because after this, what could you possibly make up? Real life is simply too bizarre.</p><p>Max, Ned, Bill, Shelby, thank you so much.</p><p>What a way to start the show. When we come back, President Trump`s bizarre message to children, kindergarteners. That`s 5-year-olds at the White House Easter Egg roll.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have never had an economy like we have right now. And we are going to make it big Iran bigger and better and stronger. Just think of $700 billion because that is all going in to our military this year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: I don`t know how many kids thinking about $700 billion. But I`m thinking about Sinclair. The propaganda machine. We are going to talk to a former Sinclair anchor spilling the beans about the pressure to sell the corporate`s message.</p><p>Also Mark Zuckerberg hitting back at his rival or at least another big tech CEO, Tim Cook of Apple and he gives a timeline for fix being Facebook.</p><p>I am Stephanie Ruhle in for Ari Melber. And you know that you are watching THE BEAT here on MSNBC.</p><p>RUHLE: Welcome back. I`m Stephanie Ruhle.</p><p>Today, President Trump is making an appearance at the annual White House Easter egg roll. And there were a lot of things he didn`t cover today. Notably, the markets, which tumbled amid a brewing trade war or at least skirmish with China. Instead, with an Easter bunny standing at his side, he touted the economy and the military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have never had an economy like we have right now. And we are going to make it bigger and better and stronger. Our military is now at a level, it will soon be at a level that it`s never been before. Just think of 700 billion, because that`s all going into our military this year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: He also responded to a reporter question about immigration in front of a group of kids. Again, I said at that before, 5-year-olds, kindergartners who are there to see the Easter bunny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Democrats have really let them down. It is a shame. And now people are taking advantage of DACA and that`s a shame. It should have never happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: DACA. Joining me now, Michael Steele, a former RNC chairman and MSNBC political analyst.</p><p>Michael, what was your take on the President`s performance today?</p><p>MICHAEL STEELE, FORMER RNC CHAIRMAN: The man has no time and place awareness. That`s clearly it. You know, this is a big festive occasion. Like you said, there are a bunch of four and 5-year-olds all over the lawn there. You know, little Easter eggs and bunnies running around. And you know, to use that as a messaging point on the military and DACA and other things to me is just kind of tone-deaf to the occasion. And I get it, you want to get your message out there, but leave that for others who can have those conversations with the press on the side while you talk about, you know, the joys of the Easter season and having these kids here, family and those types of things. So time and place awareness, it does matter.</p><p>RUHLE: Well, how about his message being factually correct? You know, there`s this talk with more members of the sort of the establishment cabinet gone, you know. Gary Cohn is still in the building but leaving. Hope Hicks is gone. Rob Porter, no longer in the building. People are saying this is Trump unleashed.</p><p>STEELE: It is. No, I mean, this is probably the freest Donald Trump has felt as President. Period. He is looking around, and he is saying all those folks who are going to be there to block and defend for him have been run out. Those were there to control and manage him have been run out. And so, from his perspective, those who are left do not have what it takes to stand up to him and even control the messaging let alone what he is going to do.</p><p>RUHLE: But how about, Michael, fact-checking. How do other --.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RUHLE: You talked to establishment Republicans all day every day.</p><p>STEELE: Yes.</p><p>RUHLE: How can they stand with the President when he goes out after DACA blaming Democrats when he ended it? He makes no mention of the stock market - excuse me, he makes no - he mentions the market and the great economy.</p><p>STEELE: Right.</p><p>RUHLE: And he does it reference China putting in place tariffs. And to go to Amazon saying you are not paying fair share. You could hate the game and want to change the rules. But Amazon is working and paying within the bombardments of the law.</p><p>STEELE: Right. And so, what`s your point?</p><p>RUHLE: If I`m Paul Ryan, if I`m Mitch McConnell --.</p><p>STEELE: Did you hear Paul Ryan respond to that? No.</p><p>RUHLE: How can they not drew this and say, right on, brother?</p><p>STEELE: I mean, what he is going to do? Paul Ryan is not going to come out and go where the President was factually incorrect on that. He is not going to do that. He hasn`t done that. We missed goes back to the campaign. There is no will inside the Republican establishment on the hill.</p><p>RUHLE: Why?</p><p>STEELE: To present the counter narrative. Because the President`s got them by the short of their voter base. And the fact of the matter is, the President`s style, his messaging and his impromptu character or nature is something that animates that base. And until that changes for a lot of these members, they are not going to take that penalty point. There`s no reason for them to do it. It`s unfortunate. We will see what happens come November. And if they lose the House because of their failure to step up as you are saying, then we will see how they respond going into 2020.</p><p>But right now, you know, Stephanie, there`s no incentive for them to do that, because we haven`t seen them do it up to this point. They are not going to start this Easter weekend with that. This is just not there.</p><p>RUHLE: Fair point. Well, trade wars, President Trump says they are good. They are easy to win. We will see how that plays out.</p><p>Michael, thank you so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>STEELE: Go it. Take care.</p><p>RUHLE: All right. Ahead, the largest owner of TV stations across the country now under fire after a local anchor, his own anchors push Trump`s fake news message and some are saying I don`t want to do it.</p><p>And former on-air Sinclair broadcasting (INAUDIBLE) joins us live.</p><p>Also a Trump ally, Chris Christie blasting a Trump staffer`s ethics. As \"New York\" magazine`s says Trump is using the power and prestige of his office to line his own pockets. Richard Painter joins me next.</p><p>RUHLE: Welcome back. I`m Stephanie Ruhle in for Ari Melber.</p><p>A conservative-leaning television empire under fire accused of parroting Donald Trump`s talking points about the media. Sinclair broadcasting. Never heard of them? Well, they have almost 200 local TV stations across the country. And they are on the front pages after a video went viral, featuring news anchors reciting this mandatory script.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP PLAYING)</p><p>RUHLE: In an internal memo obtained by NBC News, Sinclair executives are defending themselves saying quote \"the critics are now upset about our well-researched journalistic initiative, focused on fair and objective reporting.\"</p><p>Let`s break this down. Joining me now is Curt Client, a former Sinclair anchor and meteorologist, Dave Truedell, a union rep for photojournalist and (INAUDIBLE) and Renato Marriotti, a former federal prosecutor.</p><p>Renato, I turn to you, because it was your tweet that said this is the company that is going to take over tribune soon, along with the 42 TV stations it owned. If that doesn`t concern you, it should. Tell us why it should.</p><p>RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, what we are seeing is a company that is pushing a far-right agenda that is taking over more and more local TV stations across this country. And I will tell you, there are many parts of this country that might only have one or two local television stations and people aren`t going to -- don`t always realize that what they`re getting is not an objective recitation of the news. These anchors that have local reputations that people have learned to trust over the years are being hijacked by a corporate agenda and will ultimately, what`s happening is people are getting fed a one-sided propaganda and frankly, it`s a concern.</p><p>STEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC ANCHOR: But Renato, where could it go? Because the average person could look at what those anchors said and say, I don`t know, taken one at a time, it doesn`t sound so bad and don`t T.V. anchors read scripts? So to the person out there with that response to these videos, what do you say?</p><p>MARIOTTI: Well, what I think makes this country great is having a diversity of voices, and right now we have a presidency that is trying to stifle the free press, trying to stifle the people who can be a check or challenge to the president. And here we have Sinclair Broadcasting that is very tight with the administration, where frankly, Jared Kushner and others have said that we`ve struck deals and we`ve given favorable treatment to Sinclair. What I`m concerned about is that there isn`t a diversity of views. Let the anchors, if these views are so -- are so -- have so much merit, then why not let the anchors come to those conclusions on their own instead of feeding them from a corporate headquarters.</p><p>RUHLE: OK, Kirk, you worked for Sinclair stations for five years and I know you`re not there now, and you weren`t there in the last year after President Trump won the election or Jared Kushner struck this dial but tell me what it`s like inside, the editorial pressures that may exist if they do.</p><p>KIRK CLYATT, FORMER SINCLAIR ANCHOR: Well, Stephanie, this is certainly not the first time that Sinclair has tried something like this. Right after 9/11, I was actually out of the country reporting at the time for Sinclair`s flagship station in Baltimore Fox 45 WBFF. But at that time, with great controversy and great angst in the newsroom, the anchors and the number of reporters, they were compelled to do something very similar, reading a statement about how they supported President Bush`s war on terrorism. As Renato has just said, if the anchors come to these conclusions, let them come to themselves. And a friend of mine over the weekend contacted me and they say what is so bad about this announcement? Well, what they`re doing here is you know, everybody knows in propaganda. The most important thing you can do in propaganda is repeat the same message over and over again. What Sinclair is doing is says oh, no, we would never do anything to bring you fake news. That`s just not going to happen.</p><p>It`s all these other people we are concerned about and worried about, while they are the company that more than any other, with their forced-run commentaries from people such as Mark Hyman which are extreme and I think has really gotten some people aware of stations they`ve recently taken over such as KOMO in Seattle, a very progressive area, like what is this coming out of my television from a station that I used to know and trust. So you have these extreme commentaries coming from this station, a very cookie- cutter way that is certainly not good for America. We`ve come so far from the days. When I started in the media, it was 1975 and there used to be a rule called 7-7-7 rule, Stephanie, which means that one company could own seven A.M., seven F.M. and seven television stations. That gave local control.</p><p>Here in Las Vegas, we had a man named Jim Rogers who recently passed away, and unfortunately, his station KSNV taken over by Sinclair Broadcasting. This was a man who really did serve the public as a public trustee instead of this must announcements. He had community organizations, say from the Filipino Community, say from the Hispanics Business Community come on the air and tell what`s happening, what`s important in their communities. That has been replaced from something that is important for us and under each individual market across the country, by these forced, must-run, lock-step with the Trump administration commentaries. And of course, you have to remember, Stephanie, that every time you have a newsroom meeting, that is a way of advocacy journalism. What stories is that news team going to cover today?</p><p>RUHLE: All right, well, let`s talk about those newsrooms. Now, Dave, you represent the photo journalists at KOMO which we just heard is a Sinclair station in Seattle, and that is at the center of all of this. What has been the talk around the station of the anchors having to read these prepared scripts?</p><p>DAVE TWEDELL, UNION REPRESENTATIVE, SINCLAIR PHOTOJOURNALISTS: The talk around the station is that this is of a piece with what`s been going on ever since Sinclair bought that station in 2013. And it is one-way drift towards more control from Baltimore headquarters, where Sinclair headquarters is and less and less control at home. Now, it is true as of this moment, they have not affected the local broadcast but as you saw on that video that went viral over the weekend, where you see all of the stations saying the exact same thing, that is the real threat. Political issues come and go, structural changes are forever and the FCC has allowed this monster that will be the new Sinclair after they pick up the Tribune stations. They`re going to double their audience reach. Never before in American history has any station -- any owner been allowed to have any more than 39 percent reach of the country. Because of a gimmick passed by the FCC, they will now have 72 percent reach. And because of another gimmick passed by the FCC, the door is open towards a national broadcast. I`m far more concerned and our members are far more concerned about a national broadcast just supplanting local news altogether and getting rid of the services that local news provides, that is what has been -- the door has been opened by the FCC, and that is really troubling.</p><p>RUHLE: All right, quickly before we go, Renato, today the President tweeted Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more fake NBC which is a total joke. When the President says something like this, doesn`t that make Sinclair`s argument that it is fair down the middle and unbiased harder?</p><p>MARIOTTI: I think so. And frankly, what I see, Stephanie, is the President of the United States, Donald Trump trying to say that no one other than him is where you can get truth from. He attacks any independent source of information, try and convince his followers and his supporters that you can only go to him for the truth, and that is really scary.</p><p>RUHLE: Gentlemen, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. And I want to make it clear, we invited Sinclair executives to come on and discuss this with us, and as always, every day, I invite members of this administration to join me here on MSNBC and are always welcome. Next, the new magazine cover is blowing up. You know the one I`m talking about. It`s getting a lot of attention. This picture, I cannot unsee it. It`s depicting Donald Trump as a pig and it`s arguing corruption could be his downfall. I`m talking self-dealing. Richard Painter is with me when we`re back in just 90 seconds.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My whole life, I`ve been greedy, greedy, greedy. I`ve grabbed all the money I could get, I`m so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: Oh, goodness gracious. That speech from Donald Trump on the campaign trail is at the heart of New York Magazine`s new cover story. The headline, Corruption, Not Russia is Trump`s Greatest Political Liability. And now Trump ally, Chris Christie not holding back on ethics issues in the Trump administration. Trump`s EPA Chief reportedly renting a D.C. condo from an energy lobbyist for just $50.00 a day. I need rent like that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: This was a brutally unprofessional transition. This was a transition that didn`t vet people for these types of judgment issue which I think could have been seen very easily in a lot of these people. And the President`s been ill served by this and if Mr. Pruitt is going to go, it`s because he should have never been --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does he have to go?</p><p>CHRISTIE: Listen, I don`t know how you survive this one. And if he has to go -- if he has to go, it`s because he never should have been there in the first place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: That`s a wow. Joining me now, Richard Painter, White House Ethics Chief under President George W. Bush whose watchdog group is suing the President and Hugh Hewitt host of the radio show Hugh Hewitt Show and a Host of MSNBC \"HUGH HEWITT\" Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. Mr. Painter, to you, first. We have talked a number of times, saying this is unprecedented, this is unethical. We can`t believe they`re doing this. But now it`s Chris Christie, attacking Trump and/or his cabinet ethics. Does this signal some sort of shift?</p><p>RICHARD PAINTER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS CHIEF: Well, I don`t know that it`s a shift. We`ve all known that this administration ignores ethics, ignores the law.</p><p>RUHLE: But Chris Christie. That`s a different voice.</p><p>PAINTER: Well, it is and I think we`re finding Republican supporters of President Trump, one by one, starting to realize that this administration is corrupt and has been corrupt from day one. And our lawsuit is about foreign government money that has been going to the President in violation of the United States Constitution. We have the incidents involving cabinet members getting money and favors from lobbyists. We just today had the President of the United States making statements that were false, probably knowingly false, about Amazon, driving the stock price down. If an investor lost money in that stock, that investor could sue him for securities fraud. And those investors ought to be calling a lawyer. It`s every day we have a new violation of either the constitution, the federal statutes or the ethics regulations. It`s over and over again and yes, I think people like Chris Christie are finally getting fed up and the voters are getting fed up. I`ve been fed up with this president ever since he was a candidate and it was very clear he was going to violate the law if he won the election, and that`s what we`ve had non-stop.</p><p>RUHLE: One other thing. Chris Christie, there was talking Scott Pruitt, and his apartment he rented down in Washington. Hugh, you and I have spoke via Twitter on this and you`re saying it`s much ado about nothing. Why?</p><p>HUGH HEWITT, MSNBC HOST: Well, let me begin by saying Scott Pruett is a very old friend of mine, and I`ve had him on my show a dozen times, and my son works at EPA, so I want to be very transparent. But I`ve been the designated agency ethics officer at two agencies. Like Professor Painter, I worked in the White House Counsel`s office as well and the key opinion here is that of Kevin Minoli. He is the permanent, he is the Principal Deputy Attorney General at EPA. He`s also the designated agency ethics officer. He`s a lifer. He`s been there since 2000. Gina McCarthy, President Obama`s Administrator made him the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General at EPA and Mr. Minoli reviewed the lease and upheld it. It is not in any way shape or form a gift. It`s much to do about nothing. I think this is really about policy, Stephanie, as we`ve talked about on Twitter and I think it`s about the Vacancy Act. Specifically, people on the left are upset with Scott Pruitt over the clean power plan which he repealed. The waters of the United States which he repealed, the cafe standards today which he put up for repeal. He`s executing Donald Trump`s policy on WOTUS and on regulatory roll back and they want him out. They`re also afraid that if for any reason, Attorney General Sessions leaves the Attorney Generalship, under the vacancy act, Scott Pruett is eligible to for up to 210 days to serve as attorney general, even beyond depending on circumstances.</p><p>RUHLE: OK, well, Hugh, there are ethics issues and self-dealing issues that go far beyond Scott Pruitt. So let`s go back to the New York Magazine cover where Jonathan Chait writes, to be out for yourself is probably the single most disqualifying flaw a politician can have. Do you, Hugh Hewitt, who has a much longer history around politics than I do, do you have ethics concerns with President Trump or his administration when it comes to self- dealing?</p><p>HEWITT: Yes, always. As I said, I serve as an ethics officer for two agencies and I`m aware of Professor Painter`s 180 different complaints against the agencies across the government. But in every case, Stephanie, it`s a fact and circumstances inquiry. I think every single case against Scott Pruitt has been a nagging, political attack to slow down the agenda. But there has been some very --</p><p>RUHLE: OK, then let`s go broader that Scott Pruitt. We can do Jarred Kushner, we can do President Trump.</p><p>PAINTER: Excuse me, excuse me, Stephanie, Stephanie, can you find me --</p><p>RUHLE: Richard?</p><p>PAINTER: Find my a hotel rent for $50.00 a night in Washington, D.C. and tell me that`s not a gift from a lobbyist. This is disgusting and no decent ethics lawyer would sign off on that. If that had happened in the Bush administration, I would have shut it down in a minute. $50.00 a night to get a room in Washington, D.C., you know, we all know that that that is a violation of the gift rules and no ethics lawyer could cover that up. It`s just flat-out wrong and you know it.</p><p>HEWITT: Well, I would say that to Mr. Painter, I don`t know Mr. Minoli and I don`t know you, but I wouldn`t slander a career professional who`s been there for 18 years.</p><p>PAINTER: I will -- no career professional would ever sign off on that. $50.00 a night in Washington, D.C. Give me a break. That`s a joke.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAINTER: I did not file 180 complaints. Get a room for $50.00 a night in Washington.</p><p>RUHLE: OK, then I`ll ask you. Hugh Hewitt, when was the last time you stayed in Washington, D.C.?</p><p>HEWITT: A month ago in my own home, which, by the way, I have often given to friends, but Mr. Pruitt could not use it because of the gift rules. That`s one of the funny things about this, Stephanie. When you`ve got friends in Washington, you come to town for five months and your wife is at home with the last five months of your son finishing high school, you can`t stay at a friend`s house because of the gift rules, despite Mr. Painter`s passion which is misplaced.</p><p>PAINTER: Not if you`re a lobbyist.</p><p>RUHLE: Hugh, you cannot stay at a lobbyist`s house when you`re the EPA chief and your work could directly impact theirs.</p><p>HEWITT: Stephanie, John Boehner stayed at a lobbyist`s house, rented it from him for ten years as Majority Leader of the House. It goes to whether or not it`s a gift and by the way, it`s not owned by Steven Hart, he`s been a friend of mine, again, transparency, for 25 years.</p><p>RUHLE: You don`t think $50.00 a night is a gift? You don`t think $50.00 a night is a gift? How much do you think -- how much do you think hotel rooms cost no Washington?</p><p>HEWITT: All I`m telling you is it was reviewed by the career Deputy Senior Associate General and the ethics official at this agency, for whom I have no knowledge but great deal of respect, Mr. Painter doesn`t. He`s entitled to pass judgment on whomever he wants. But there`s a reason he`s in Minnesota and not Washington, D.C. and that reason goes back to whether or not you have do regard for other professionals work. I do.</p><p>PAINTER: Excuse me, I am fed up with people being attacked in Minnesota.</p><p>HEWITT: I`m sure you are.</p><p>PAINTER: In my state, we elect people in Washington, D.C. We are sick and tired of K-Street lobbyists who looked down at us in Minnesota as you would. This is the reason you`re in Minnesota, instead of raking in money in Washington, D.C. on K-Street and leasing out a room for $50.00 a night to the EPA Administrator. This is corruption. This is why the people of Minnesota and every other state, you`re in a flyover country. While you want to look down on us, we are going to vote these people out. It is disgusting what you just said about people in Minnesota, that somehow we are here because we don`t play by your rules in Washington, D.C. We`re going to shut it down! We`re going to drain the swamp for sure and this back fill they brought in from New York, we`re going to send them back to New York, New Jersey, wherever they came from with Trump brought on down. This is really wrong, and you know it. And don`t talk down to us in Minnesota.</p><p>RUHLE: Can we just end this segment jogging on New Jersey?</p><p>HEWITT: I have a question.</p><p>RUHLE: Gentlemen, we`re going to leave it there. Clearly, this conversation is to be continued. Respect, we always need to have that.</p><p>HEWITT: Thank you, Stephanie.</p><p>RHULE: And no going after Jersey, Richard Painter, Hugh Hewitt, thank you both so much. Be sure to watch Hugh right here on MSNBC on Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. We`ll be right back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer. If our customer was our product, we could make a ton of money. We`ve elected not to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you`re Mark Zuckerberg, what would you do?</p><p>COOK: What would I do? I wouldn`t be in this situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: Ouchy-pooh. Apple`s Tim Cook hitting Mark Zuckerberg where it hurts, and now Mark Zuckerberg trying to hit back.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I find that argument, that if you`re not paying that somehow we can`t care about you to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. I think so it`s important that we don`t all get Stockholm Syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you because that sounds ridiculous to me.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: Zuckerberg also said it would take years to solve some of Facebook`s problems.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I think we will dig through this hole, but it will take a few years. I wish I could solve all these issues in three months or six months but I just think the reality is that solving some of these questions are just going to take a longer period of time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUHLE: Really? That`s a funny reality and a big reversal for Zuckerberg. In 2010, eight years ago, Zuckerberg wrote \"there needs to be a simpler way to control your information. In the coming weeks, we will add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.\" Eight years ago said it would just take a few weeks. Joining me now, my dear friend David Kirkpatrick, Author of the Facebook Effect. David, what`s your take on all this?</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, AUTHOR, THE FACEBOOK EFFECT: I think you were a little unfair in that last comparison. He was talking about a specific set of changes in whatever year that was. But (INAUDIBLE) put them in. But they clearly weren`t enough. I mean, that`s the bottom line here. Facebook lacks the controls that it needs to governor its system and he is basically backpedaling furiously in this quite interesting interview he did with Ezra Klein on Vox that came out today in a way that he has never done before. That interview is a breakthrough interview.</p><p>RUHLE: Why.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: But there are so many weird things about it.</p><p>RUHLE: What`s so breakthrough about it?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I tell you what`s breakthrough about it is that he`s acknowledging that Facebook needs help to figure out what to do. He`s never really had that humility before. He specifically said even for something as minor as you know, if Facebook tells you-you can`t put up a piece of content, there should be an external place where you can appeal that. Well, he used a word like a Supreme Court, not that`s run by people that don`t work for Facebook. That is a minor step in a very good direction because the reality is Facebook is now in a position that no company should be in and he`s starting to own that. You know, basically --</p><p>RUHLE: He`s owning that, but he`s also calling Tim Cook glib and ridiculous. You know Tim Cook. Would you call Tim Cook glib or ridiculous?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. but the Tim Cook argument is not the central issue about this interview. The Tim Cook argument is interesting because basically, Facebook is raking it in with advertising more than any other company of its size in history.</p><p>RUHLE: And they can`t possibly say they`re not a media company if what they do is get advertising dollars and they`re getting advertising dollars only from places like this.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I agree. We`ll here`s the -- you know, if you`re a media company, the big argument is they should then, therefore, bear responsibility for the content on their service which --</p><p>RUHLE: Like we do here.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: In general, we should agree that is the case and he is starting to more or less say that but, you know, it`s interesting. He is outlying himself more with Amazon as a cost-cutting company than with Apple as a you know, cost-raising company which is basically what he basically accused apple of in return. But I think the interesting thing is you know, the -- he talks so much about the social responsibility Facebook has, but in many parts of the interview, he sounds more like he`s the U.N. Secretary-General or the you know, the Head of the you know, FBI in responsibilities that he thinks Facebook has to keep society functioning normally. He keeps using the word \"we\" throughout this interview as if he is really capable of making the decisions that will properly guide society towards healthy resolutions, which he says he wants and it`s very idealistic of him. But the reality is he`s one guy who completely controls a commercial company that cannot be in the position of deciding what is right in the public square.</p><p>RUHLE: Well, David, words like we and community are why millions of people believed that Facebook was all about posting pictures of your babies and cute puppies. David, thank you so much.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Thanks for having me, Stephanie.</p><p>RUHLE: This conversation, it is not going away. And tune in this Friday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern for the full MSNBC Town Hall with Apple`s Tim Cook. You don`t want to miss it.</p><p>RUHLE: That does it for me. I will be back in tomorrow night for Mr. Ari Melber, and you can see me first thing tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Thanks for watching. \"HARDBALL\" with my friend Chris Matthews starts right now.</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Welcome Vladimir. Let`s play HARDBALL.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Elizabeth Warren (D), Massachusetts about her proposal of breaking up tech giants.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: I`m excited for it. Thank you Chuck. We`re going to get right into it because we do have a very special show this Friday night. Senator Elizabeth Warren, she made some big news today with this plan to take on some major corporations. She`s my guest in studio tonight talking about that plan. There`s a lot of other news that is also going down today from the fallout over a Paul Manafort`s light sentence to where is this Mueller probe headed? I`m going to get into all of it with her in this extensive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is, we should mention, her first time on \"The Beat\" as a presidential candidate and that will be our very next segment. Right now let me tell you the top story. It was the sight today of the President of the United States openly sympathizing with a unrepentant convicted felon. Now unrepentant is not a word that I`m telling you from my brain and our scripting or my planning, it`s literally how the judge overseeing this case, Judge Ellis, described guilty former Trump Campaign Chief Paul Manafort right before rewarding him with this very light prison sentence that was heard around the nation.</p><p>Donald Trump taking a different tack in talking about his former lawyer, Michael Cohen today who has been credited for some cooperation by Mueller. He`s trying to draw Cohen into a new fight over whether Cohen ever asked for a pardon. Now if that wasn`t enough, I could tell you the U.S. also got a weak jobs report today. Donald Trump lost his fifth communications director -- fifth. \"Fox News\" insider Bill Shine out.</p><p>And there are now reports that it was a leaker in Trump`s own White House who dished to democrats about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump`s nepotism scandal over security clearances. That`s happening right now and as Mueller gears up for Manafort`s second sentencing next week, I can also report for you I guess because it`s Friday and things are always happening in this other related case, this investigating WikiLeaks, a pretty famous witness Chelsea Manning was jailed today for refusing to talk.</p><p>All of that is going on. I want to begin with former federal prosecutor Seth Waxman whose last trial as a prosecutor was actually before Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the judge who will sentence Manafort for his crimes in the D.C. District next week. Great to have you tonight. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SETH WAXMAN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER: Before we get to next week and before we get to Senator Warren who I`m telling viewers we`re going to get to, I want to get to what we learned from the Mueller side last night because they seem to be very clear on the record, they wanted the judge to know and now the world knows, they say Manafort was lying the whole time. What is the significance of that?</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, it means that Mr. Manafort wasn`t coming forward, wasn`t being truthful. He has failed as a cooperator. The government has let the judge know that. They`re duty bound to describe the nature and extent of a potential -- a person being sentenced cooperation. And it seems very clear that he wasn`t giving the government much, if anything, during those many 50 hours.</p><p>They`ve made it clear that he didn`t do a lot for them so they haven`t done a lot for them in return. They`re going hard on him in Virginia. They got a lenient sentence there. I don`t expect it to be as lenient in D.C. next week.</p><p>MELBER: I want to ask you about Judge Jackson going ahead to that. But before we get to that, take a listen to Manafort`s own lawyer bizarrely focusing on something that`s not an issue in either case. Kevin Downing last night, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, PAUL MANAFORT`S LAWYER: I think most importantly what you saw today is the same thing that we had said from day one. There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved with any collusion with any government official from Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER: Was it suspicious that he was focused on that?</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, you know, there`s some suggestion that he`s out there trying to seek that pardon once again. I mean, it wasn`t an expressed request for a pardon. But you could see if you read between the lines, that he`s out there toeing the company line that there was no collusion.</p><p>MELBER: It wasn`t - it wasn`t an express request but it was tantamount to him coming out and saying, \"Hey, everyone, CNN sucks or the inauguration crowd was large.\" I mean, it had nothing to do with the victory that they`d just scored. You can give him legal credit. They got the result they wanted for their client. I mean Ellis gave less jail time than Manafort`s own lawyers had talked about him getting but it wasn`t about that and it`s not about next week so what else was it about?</p><p>WAXMAN: Yes, I mean it sure does look like a play for a pardon. We know that seems to be out there. Mr. Trump himself has said I`m not taking anything off the table and that raises the question of obstruction of justice which is very troubling.</p><p>MELBER: And then that brings us to your expertise. America has been going to law school together. People are learning names of judges they might never know. Judge Ellis now people have come to learn about and we`re going to talk about some of the disparities and racial justice issues in his courtroom in a minute. But as for Judge Jackson, who`s next week going to make a final call here, what can you tell us about her having been before her?</p><p>WAXMAN: Yes, I did my last trial as a federal prosecutor back in 2015 in front of her. She is a highly-respected judge. She does not suffer fools lightly and I will tell you just like every judge in this country, when they let a person stay out of jail pending trial and that person goes out</p><p>She does not suffer fools lightly. And I will tell you just like every judge in this country, when they let a person stay out of jail pending trial and that person goes out and flouts the judge`s orders and thumbs their nose or puts it right in the judge`s face and goes out and commits additional crimes, judges despise that. So I know Judge Berman Jackson is going to hold that against Mr. Manafort and in addition it`s kind of an unique case in that the sentencing guidelines are way above the maximum sentence that Judge Berman Jackson can give which is ten years. The defense has agreed that that guideline range which is upwards of 17 to 21 years is a reasonable sentence and should be sentenced within that guideline range.</p><p>MELBER: So you think it could be a tough -- tougher day next week?</p><p>WAXMAN: Yes, no question.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, Seth Waxman who`s been there, thank you.</p><p>I want to turn now as promised. I`m joined by Melissa Murray. We`re going to walk through something so important even if you`d already heard about it which is that there is racial injustice in criminal sentencing. Thank you for being here.</p><p>MELISSA MURRAY, INTERIM DEAN AND PROFESSOR OF LAW AT BOALT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW: Shocking.</p><p>MELBER: So let`s walk through this. Manafort had a pretty light sentence and it`s a reminder of the blatant inequities in our justice system. Take a look at this recent study, 2017, from the sentencing commission which found black male offenders received sentences that are 19 percent longer than similarly situated white male offenders and that`s just when you get to the sentencing stage and the facts.</p><p>Then let`s look at Judge Ellis more narrowly. This is the person who sentenced Paul Manafort and hasn`t shied away in some cases although he is a critic of prosecutors at times but let`s look at what he`s done in other cases in the past, 2009. Here`s former Congressman Jefferson, and Judge Ellis handled him for financial crimes, not violence, a 13-year sentence over corruption. It was at the time the longest sentence ever for a Congressman. So when you look at this argument that maybe financial crimes are not sentenced to the max, that wasn`t true there for Judge Ellis and it`s not true around the country.</p><p>Here`s former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. He was sentenced to 28 years in 2013, the max. It was a corruption case. His coconspirator got 21 years, a little under the 28-year maximum. Unlike Paul Manafort, Mayor Kilpatrick also talked to the court about his remorse. He said quote, \"He really, really, really messed up and took full responsibility for all his actions.\" NYU`s Law Professor Melissa Murray, a former clerk at times to then Judge Sotomayor. Thanks for being here.</p><p>MELISSA MURRAY, INTERIM DEAN AND PROFESSOR OF LAW AT BOALT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s get into it. Because Judge Ellis is more critical of prosecutors and I want to note that to be accurate. But this was a record- breaking sentence for Jefferson in his courtroom. Mr. Kilpatrick we showed there also didn`t live a blameless life. But these were all African- American males.</p><p>MURRAY: So it should come as no surprise to anyone who has been watching the news or even listening to casual observers that there are serious disparities on the basis of race in the criminal justice system, both at the charging stage where the charges are levied and all the way through to sentencing. That shouldn`t be shocking. The fact that it is being raised in such a blatant way in this particular case is actually newsworthy. Judge Ellis.</p><p>MELBER: You`re saying this is even worse than what someone familiar with how racist the system can be in its operation?</p><p>MURRAY: Likely because of the political overlay. This is not your average run of the mill case with any random ...</p><p>MELBER: Certainly not.</p><p>MURRAY: . so this is unusual. The political overlay is really unusual here. I don`t think that we should necessarily be skeptical of a judge who questions the severity of criminal sentences.</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>MURRAY: And Judge Ellis has consistently done that.</p><p>MELBER: As mentioned.</p><p>MURRAY: There have been cases where he has challenged the mandatory minimum and has sentenced the mandatory minimum because it is mandatory but he`s expressed real reservations about severe sentences. The problem I think with this case is it does look so jarring in light of everything that has happened and in light of the observations that the judge has made. The idea Paul Manafort has had a blameless life is ludicrous in light of the fact that he has lied to the special counsel. That he has been charged in another jurisdiction with obstruction of justice. This is not a blameless individual. This is an individual who hasn`t gotten caught yet.</p><p>MELBER: We should be clear when it`s a complete automatic mandatory - judges can talk about what they think about it .</p><p>MURRAY: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: . but they don`t have the legal freedom to do anything different.</p><p>MURRAY: Exactly.</p><p>MELBER: With the sentencing guidelines, that`s when you get into the discretion and the choice.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: And its pretty telling that Judge Ellis looked at all of this including the post indictment obstruction and then the attacks on Mueller through the plea deal that Manafort blew up for himself and then the statement in court that didn`t even repent and still came down so differently than Congressman Jefferson. Do you think this is a situation where judges don`t even realize their own blind spots?</p><p>MURRY: I don`t know. Judge Ellis, I`ve never seen Judge Ellis unlike Seth Waxman. All I can say about the situation is that there are true disparities here. This is a four year -- less than a four-year sentence on truly serious crimes versus 13 years also for financial crimes. And Judge Ellis has noted that the severity of these sentences has real consequences for the offender, for their families. All of that was true in the case of Bill Jefferson and all of that will be true for Paul Manafort but the difference between 4 years and 13 years is really sizable especially in a case with the political implications this one has.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, it`s quite a -- we have it on the screen behind us. These are two faces. This is the face of two people who were involved in politics who were convicted of bad things. Right? So the question isn`t are either of them great. The question is why does the other face, Paul Manafort here behind me, why does that face look so different in our system and is treated to different than Jefferson? There is also just the general fact that some of this is cooky even beyond race, there`s class and other dynamics. You were talking about survivor star Richard Hatch. Tell us about that. We`ll put it on the screen.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes. So if you`re a pulp culture aficionado, as I am, you know Richard Hatch was the first winner of \"Survivor\" and when he received those winnings, he did not pay taxes on them. He was later charged in the District of Rhode Island of tax evasion and he served 51 months in prison - or he was sentenced to 51 months in prison for that crime. Tax evasion, a really serious crime, as serious as the fraud and tax fraud charges that Paul Manafort was up against here. The difference between 51 months and 47 months again not that sizable but again the political overlay makes this look a little more complicated and I think it`s unusual that given everything, given that Judge Ellis recognized that Paul Manafort had had not expressed remorse, that there were these issues of lying to the prosecutors even though he was supposed to be cooperating. That nonetheless Judge Ellis came to the conclusion that Paul Manafort had otherwise lived a blameless life.</p><p>MELBER: Right, and I`m not here to search inside the judge`s soul. I can`t do that as a reporter but I am here to show the facts and the discrepancies and the system that we`ve been documenting and reporting on for some time which grinds down African-Americans and people of color and explicitly and especially African-American males. And so to have it all pop off.</p><p>MURRAY: And women. There`s also the issue of Crystal Mason who registered to vote not realizing as a former convicted felon that she was ineligible to do so.</p><p>MELBER: And didn`t even have the requisite intent and got years.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes, five years.</p><p>MELBER: Yes I know but I think when you look at the assumptions that are made about whether someone is blameless and the type of life they`ve led, I think that goes to a final point that I think can be confusing that I think we need to reflect on more which is empathy and sympathy are really great human emotions when we deal with them day to day but there`s a reason they`re not supposed to govern a fair and equal system of law that is supposed to be standard for everyone. Because it seems that when empathy comes up in some of these places, it`s some sort of beltway swamp empathy for only certain types of people.</p><p>MURRAY: Well it also raises the point that elections matter. Judge Ellis is on the bench because he is a Reagan appointee. President Trump has at this point in his tenure in office, appointed more judges than President Obama. These are judges who again, the diversity of the bench matters. This is not necessarily a situation where this judge might be as sympathetic or empathetic with other kinds of defendants.</p><p>MELBER: Melissa Murray gets the last word on this one. Thank you for being here tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>MURRAY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER: Up next, we fit in a quick break and then we`re going to get into it, my exclusive sit down interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren right here in New York making news with this big plan to break up tech giants like Amazon and Google. She`s one of the biggest names right now in the presidential race. She`s at 30 Rock and later, don`t think we forgot. We still got a \"Fall Back\" for you. Actor John Turturro who has played a lawyer on TV and Nick Ackerman who has played a lawyer on TV. I`m telling you it`s a big show. Please stick around, we`ll be right back.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Elizabeth Warren is one of the most famous democrats running for president right now. And she`s in New York today unveiling a big plan to take on corporations. Something that I think is fair to say she`s known for. But specifically corporations which have actually proven popular among voters and among a lot of democratic donors which makes this in itself pretty interesting.</p><p>She`s also heading into this interview at a pretty busy time in the Mueller probe, you may have heard. Let`s just say we have a lot to get to and we`re going to do it right now. Senator Elizabeth Warren here for the interview in 30 seconds.</p><p>MELBER: Joining me now is Senator Elizabeth Warren democrat from Massachusetts and a 2020 presidential candidate. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Thank you. I`m delighted to be here.</p><p>MELBER: You have criticized a lot of big banks. Today you`re talking about breaking up big tech. Why?</p><p>WARREN: So here`s the deal, we need real competition in this field and there`s a problem. So Amazon, Google, they own a platform which is pretty cool, right where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say, to Amazon in order to sell their goods.</p><p>And they don`t just compete straight up. They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide, oh. I`m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect. It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team. My view is you can do one, be an umpire, or the other, own a team. But you don`t get to do both at the same time.</p><p>MELBER: Right and you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You dropped this plan today. This is your first big TV interview about it. Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Warren rolling out one of her big policy plans, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen to date from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s big, and it`s bold, and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER: Could she really do it? What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN: You bet. The answer is yes, but you know let`s be really clear about this. If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at -- you know, 63 choices and get the one that`s going to be there in 48 hours. You can still do that as a consumer. This preserves the platform.</p><p>If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it. What this is about is about competition, it`s about all those little businesses and start-up businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon, or on Google and who are at an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google -- if they like the money they see that you`re making because they get all the information, they decide to go in to competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s go through some of these companies so we can all understand.</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>MELBER: Yes or no, and then we`ll get in to them.</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>MELBER: Do you view them as operating monopolies? Google?</p><p>WARREN: So Google, yes -- pretty much in a monopoly.</p><p>MELBER: Amazon?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, yes. They`ve got - can we just do on Amazon, 49 percent .</p><p>MELBER: Well I`m going to go forward, Facebook? Yes?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Apple?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: OK, so let`s look at Facebook first and then we`ll go through each of them.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: So Mr. Zuckerberg disagrees with you, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is Twitter the same as what you do?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It overlaps a portion of what we do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don`t think you have a monopoly?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It certainly doesn`t feel like that to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER: Is he wrong?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Because he has the Facebook platform, that`s the key part here. So if you want to check on what your college roommates are up to, you`ve got to go to his platform. And the part that gets me and I really want to describe at this way, monopoly power is that so many folks have got to come to his platform to be able to transact. He wants to be able to sell ads for example, on that. The problem is he`s scooping all this information up.</p><p>MELBER: He`s -- Facebook is your arm in this analogy? OK.</p><p>WARREN: OK, this is the platform. That`s exactly right.</p><p>MELBER: And then what goes on?</p><p>WARREN: And then what happens is he uses all this information and then makes the decisions about how to scoop up others in the marketplace. For example, he runs a buy and sell for ads. So he`s in every position on that -- a buyer of ads, a seller of ads and running the little platform where those are sold.</p><p>That just creates an enormous competitive advantage and here`s the problem on every one of these, these advantages are now so enormous that venture capitalists are starting to say, \"Wait a minute if you`re going to go in to a space where you could in some way be challenging Amazon, or be challenging Facebook or be challenging Google -- it is now referred to as the kill zone.\"</p><p>And venture capital has gone down, investment by about 20 percent over the past five years or so because they`re just saying it doesn`t make any sense.</p><p>MELBER: So if you plan is enacted, does each of those companies get somewhat broken up?</p><p>WARREN: So what they did is the platform gets broken off from the individual companies. That`s what I`m saying.</p><p>MELBER: And you think that`s good for consumers?</p><p>WARREN: It`s excellent for consumers because it not only means the platform will be level. You`re not getting something from Amazon pushed out in front of you, and a better competitor hidden back on page six. It also means the next good idea has a chance to mature and develop.</p><p>MELBER: Right, but Amazon just like everyone remembers as booksellers is not going to be knee tapping everyone, then you.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Then you -- you`re here on \"The Beat\" tonight announcing this plan today and you`re campaigning in Long Island City.</p><p>WARREN: I am.</p><p>MELBER: . where Amazon just pulled out, is that deliberate?</p><p>WARREN: That`s right, you bet it`s deliberate.</p><p>MELBER: What are you saying?</p><p>WARREN: What I`m talking about is how big these tech giants have gotten, so that what we see -- and we saw right there on Long Island City. Is they come in, they bully towns, cities, states all around the country.</p><p>You know the handful of tech giants have gotten more than $10 billion in breaks from towns, and cities, and states over the past few years.</p><p>MELBER: Corporate welfare...</p><p>WARREN: That`s right, but.</p><p>MELBER: So let me ask you this, is that a problem with the incentives or was New York wrong to give them that much of an offer?</p><p>WARREN: The problem - the problem is the \"Hunger Games\" about it because that`s what`s happening here, and it`s a problem because it creates more concentration in the industry. You know, they`re not offering the cities and towns a zillion bucks in goodies and tax breaks to the entrepreneur whose getting started, to the small business that`s trying to make a go of it. Even to the medium-sized business and big business that want to grow more -- nope.</p><p>This is about the giants who are able to swagger in to town and say, \"Lay in front of me what you`re going to offer and I`ll decide if I like it or not, and then I`ll go somewhere else and see what they`ll offer. And by the way, if you start asking me hard questions about the jobs, about where the money`s going to come from, about how much guarantee I`m putting in to this -- I`ll just get mad and go somewhere else.\"</p><p>MELBER: So your new plan also talks a lot about antitrust. You`ve been critical of the AT&amp;T merger with CNN`s parent company.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: So has Donald Trump, but \"The New Yorker\" reported this week his reason was he wanted to use those powers to beat up on CNN.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Is that wrong, and if so what do you do about it?</p><p>WARREN: Yes, it`s very wrong. For the president to say I want to see an antitrust prosecution based on political advantage to the president, is about as wrong as it gets. What I want to see is antitrust enforcement, because it protects markets, because it protects small competitors, because it protects consumers over the long run.</p><p>MELBER: So how do you deal with what he has allegedly done? And should there be punishment for that?</p><p>WARREN: Well I think we need -- I mean, I think there`s going to be a very serious investigation about this. There`s a fundamental question about whether what he`s done is even legal.</p><p>MELBER: Would that -- that may have been a legal way to attack CNN?</p><p>WARREN: May have been.</p><p>MELBER: Interesting, which they happen to be a competitor but we`re interested in more of the free press issue. Let`s go to the way the Treasury Department is run, because you look at it right now and I`ll draw your attention to a very simple illustration. Under Donald Trump, we can put up on the screen you have in the red zone there, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: . as part of Treasury Department leadership.</p><p>If you go back in the Obama era we checked and as you know we had Goldman Sachs former executives running Treasury then. Go back to Bush, also Goldman Sachs.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: You go back to Bill Clinton, also Goldman Sachs. In a Warren Administration would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN: Nope.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Oh, that`s easy.</p><p>MELBER: That`s a litmus test?</p><p>WARREN: Absolutely. But let me tell you why, the problem we`ve got right now is a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington that causes everybody to be on this (ph) for -- wait a minute, the next time this Treasury Secretary puts forward a proposal is it because it really helps the economy, helps the American consumer, helps the American homeowner?</p><p>Or is it because it helps their former and possibly future employer? Let`s just do for one second the Gary Cohn example -- another Goldman Sachs, you remember.</p><p>MELBER: Oh, I`m sure.</p><p>WARREN: That`s exactly right. So Trump appoints Gary Cohn, he leaves Goldman Sachs and Gary Cohn is going to have exactly one job. And that is to ramrod through a rewrite of the tax laws that will profoundly affect Goldman Sachs. So what does Goldman Sachs do as Gary walks out the door? They hand him nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, it`s a gift -- they don`t have to.</p><p>MELBER: Is it legal bribery?</p><p>WARREN: I think of it as a pre-bribe.</p><p>MELBER: Pre-bribe?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. So Gary then goes out and guess what he does? He writes a tax law and manages to help ramrod it through that benefits Goldman Sachs to the tune of oh, a quarter of a billion dollars in the first go-round.</p><p>MELBER: And what you`re saying.</p><p>WARREN: And then it`s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>MELBER: What you`re saying makes sense, and we have such ripe targets, I think people could understand what you`re pointing to. But what does it mean for the Democratic Party if this was also how Obama and Clinton ran the Treasury? Would you be a fundamental break with that, I guess is the question?</p><p>WARREN: Well the problem -- I have written the biggest anticorruption bill since Watergate. Because we have a fundamental problem in Washington, and understand it`s a problem that predates Trump by decades.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: Trump may be the most extreme example now, the pre-bribe of Gary Cohn for example. But we have a longstanding problem, and that`s the influence of money on decision making in Washington.</p><p>So this bill has lots of pieces to it, including closing the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. Ending lobbying as we know it. Putting a real ethics cop on the beat, saying that the heads of these agencies cannot be trading in stocks .</p><p>MELBER: Right, so as a political matter are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money?</p><p>WARREN: Maybe. But this isn`t about the money. This is about how it is we`re kind of make this country work again not just for the rich of the powerful. How we`re going to make it work for everyone. You know, we live in America right now where Washington works great for giant drug companies, just not for people are trying fill a prescription.</p><p>MELBER: So you talk about -- this is -- you talk about how the Beltway works. Everyone has been talking about the rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got. When you look at that, does that reflect what you`re saying when Washington works well for the connected in the affluent and nobody else?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. It`s two justice systems. Look at the words carved above the United States Supreme Court. Equal justice under law. But look at the reality. People who got buckets of money and a well-connected get treated with kid gloves.</p><p>MELBER: So do you think --</p><p>WARREN: Everybody else doesn`t.</p><p>MELBER: Do you think when you look at that statistically, that a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, we know the data on this. Of course, the sentence would have been different. In fact, study after study after study shows that for the exact same crime, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be prosecuted, to be wrongfully convicted, and to receive harsher sentences. Race matters in our criminal justice system and it is not a system of equal justice under law.</p><p>MELBER: On the bullet probe, I read a pledge you recently made. You said -- this is interesting. You would issue \"no pardons for anyone implicated in the investigations into Donald Trump.\" How can you know that before the investigations are over? Would that include someone like Andy McCabe, the former acting FBI director who was under investigation right now and in the D.C. office?</p><p>WARREN: Because I know what pardons are for. Pardons are there for the powerless to show a little justice that they need. Pardons are not there as part of a plea agreement. That`s somewhere else in the system. We reserve pardons for those people who didn`t receive justice under the law. And I`m not there to say pardons are going to be part of a political horse trade of my administration.</p><p>MELBER: Does that mean you would commit to saying you`re never going to pardon anyone that worked directly for you?</p><p>WARREN: I assume so. I mean I don`t know if any case why I would do that. This is about the powerless. That`s what pardons are supposed to be about. Not about people who have connections, not about people who -- not about people who have a way to be protected, who can hire the lawyers, who get to work their way through the system, who get the best representation. Pardons are about one last way that we try to put a little justice back into a system that today is very unjust.</p><p>MELBER: If Bob Mueller finishes this probe with no further indictments, so they don`t indict anyone in America for helping the Russians collude, what do you think then is the conclusion and two people who were hoping this would all bust Donald Trump have to accept those lawful findings even if they don`t go far as far as somewhat?</p><p>WARREN: I don`t know what his reports are going to say and we just have to wait and see. But I`ll tell you this about this report that it has already produced nearly three dozen indictments or guilty pleas. This is a serious investigation. In addition to that, we`ve got investigations that are going on in other jurisdictions and the House has just started its own series of investigations.</p><p>You know, the sound of hoof beats of all those investigations catching up with Donald Trump must be loud in his ears.</p><p>MELBER: I want to ask you about some politics and some of the fun stuff, what makes you tick.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: On the politics, the Democratic Party`s announced you guys aren`t going to do any debates with Fox News. Is that the right call?</p><p>WARREN: You know, this is ultimately a decision for the -- for the party to make, but I do understand that when more and more keeps coming out about how Fox News was just operating as an arm of the Trump campaign and then the Trump administration, boy that doesn`t much look like we really have a free and independent press. It just looks like a propaganda machine.</p><p>MELBER: So you agree with the chairman.</p><p>WARREN: So I understand -- I understand why it is that the Democratic Party would say we`re just not going to be a part of that. And I -- you know, look, I want to be able to get out and talk to everyone. I mean, I`ll just tell you that as a candidate. I want to be and everybody`s living room. I want a chance to reach out to everyone.</p><p>MELBER: And that makes sense. I guess the thing we heard from a lot of activists was while you may go talk to whoever you choose to, why should as you put it, an entity that was perceived as being an arm of the Trump administration help pick who runs against Trump?</p><p>WARREN: And I think that`s part of why the Democratic Party as a party since we got a real problem here.</p><p>MELBER: Mike Bloomberg, do you want his endorsement?</p><p>WARREN: What -- I`m glad to have everybody`s endorsement but I`m not out looking for any of them.</p><p>MELBER: You`re not going to ask -- you`re not asking Mr. Bloomberg?</p><p>WARREN: Not asking.</p><p>MELBER: OK. Bernie Sanders has more individual donors right now than any other Dem candidate by a long ways. Is that because he`s really popular with the grassroots or is it because he`s good at raising money?</p><p>WARREN: I assume it`s because he`s popular with the grassroots. Bernie has been out there fighting his fight and you know that`s got a lot of people energized.</p><p>MELBER: Is he the front-runner?</p><p>WARREN: I -- you need a pundit for this, but it sure looks like it. I mean --</p><p>MELBER: It does look like it.</p><p>WARREN: Punditry is not my business but --</p><p>MELBER: Not your thing. Let me ask you something I was wondering because you spent most of your life in other types of yeah service. How old were you when you first thought I think I might run for office?</p><p>WARREN: Oh golly. Well, let`s see. I could just do the math but I was in my 60s. I never was going to do this.</p><p>MELBER: When you were teaching, this was not the next step?</p><p>WARREN: Not even close.</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to run through a couple of quick ones. They`re fun or at least maybe nerdy fun.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: And we could do them as fast as possible. We call it a lightning round sometimes.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: Past or present, favorite member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</p><p>WARREN: Oh Janet Yellen.</p><p>MELBER: Janet Yellen?</p><p>WARREN: Oh she`s -- she is fabulous.</p><p>MELBER: International Women`s Day, a woman past or present who inspires you.</p><p>WARREN: Oh let me think, Bella Abzug. You know, a woman who just got out there and fought for what she believed in. I love it.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve got a couple one-word associations. If you could do it in a word. Some of them relate to your bill.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: Amazon?</p><p>WARREN: Can I have two words?</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Google.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful. And that`s really the point of the two bigs it`s they`ve got too much power and they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors, and ultimately to change the consumer experience. We got to change that.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite song to work out to.</p><p>WARREN: Anything from Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Patsy Cline. Favorite --</p><p>WARREN: I love Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite album or artist when you were growing up.</p><p>WARREN: Any of the Beatles.</p><p>MELBER: Beatles?</p><p>WARREN: Probably the White Album.</p><p>MELBER: Now I got to know your favorite Beatle.</p><p>WARREN: Oh no, that`s not fair. That`s like asking your favorite child.</p><p>MELBER: I would guess and what do I know. I don`t know you that well. I would guess Lennon. George Harrison? Boom.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Your dream running mate throughout history living or dead. You could pick a person that would run with you.</p><p>WARREN: Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>MELBER: A Republican?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Because he took on the trusts?</p><p>WARREN: Because he was brave, and he took on the trust and he didn`t care how many people were going to be mad about it, and he did it. This is what`s amazing for the right reasons. It wasn`t just that they were big. It wasn`t just that they were dominating an economy. It wasn`t just that they were putting farmers out of business and competitors out of business and small companies out of business, it was that they had too much political power.</p><p>And it was the very fact of that political power that caused Teddy Roosevelt to say I`m going to be a trust buster. Man, I`d like to have that guy at my side.</p><p>MELBER: There is a beloved actress who`s been talking about you, Annette Bening.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s take a look. I think we have this for you. Annette Bening says she knows she looks like Elizabeth Warren. Thank you very much. Now, did she look like you or do you look like her?</p><p>WARREN: Either way. I`m totally happy with this comparison.</p><p>MELBER: You like this.</p><p>WARREN: Yes, I do.</p><p>MELBER: Would you be comfortable if and when and then there`s a Warren movie, would you be comfortable with her playing you.</p><p>WARREN: I`m all in.</p><p>MELBER: You`re ready for that.</p><p>WARREN: I`m ready.</p><p>MELBER: Have you guys ever met?</p><p>WARREN: Yes, actually.</p><p>MELBER: And?</p><p>WARREN: Once. I think she actually does -- we kind of look like each other.</p><p>MELBER: Did you talk about it at the time?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Just a little bit.</p><p>MELBER: How could you not?</p><p>WARREN: Yes, how could we not.</p><p>MELBER: We have to ask before we let you go how Bailey is doing. This dog is beloved on your campaign.</p><p>WARREN: This dog is the best. Between the Bailey cam and the opportunity to meet people and voters and people been bringing him little treats. So Bailey is filling out now for a ten-month-old dog.</p><p>MELBER: And he has his own greeting line as well as you.</p><p>WARREN: Oh man, he does a photo line like you wouldn`t believe. And I want to be really clear about this, Ari, it is not a competition.</p><p>MELBER: No.</p><p>WARREN: I say this because I definitely do not want to be in competition with a ten-month-old golden retriever.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve seen him. I`m a dog person myself. I`m sure he could get a lot of individual donors as well if he goes in that direction.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Warren, coming here on the day of your big tech announcement, we really appreciate it. I hope you`ll come back on THE BEAT.</p><p>WARREN: Good.</p><p>MELBER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Senate Elizabeth Warren. And we will be right back.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Elizabeth Warren on THE BEAT making some news right here. A new pledge, a revelation on who she says the front-runner is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got, a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence.</p><p>WARREN: Of course the sentence would have been different.</p><p>MELBER: Corporate welfare, was New York wrong to give him up that much of an offer.</p><p>WARREN: No, the problem is the Hunger Games.</p><p>MELBER: In a Warren administration, would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running in the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN: Nope.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money?</p><p>WARREN: Maybe.</p><p>MELBER: Bernie Sanders has more individual donors right now. Is he the front-runner?</p><p>WARREN: I -- you need a pundit for this, but it sure looks like it.</p><p>MELBER: Google.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Too powerful. Just some highlights of our discussion. Now next we go -- it`s Friday, we go to \"FALLBACK FRIDAY\" with the actor John Turturro and our own Nick Akerman, that`s next.</p><p>MELBER: It`s time for a special edition of \"FALLBACK.\" I`m joined by Emmy award-winning actor John Turturro, currently starring in the film Gloria Bell along with Julianne Moore. Other notable films include Quiz Show, Michael Bay`s Transformers franchise, and of course the collaborations with the Coen brothers including the unforgettable role as Jesus Quintana in The Big Lebowski, one of our favorites.</p><p>Turturro also played a scrappy lawyer in the HBO hit The Night Of which is something he has in common with our other guest Nick Akerman, also plays a lawyer on television and was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District and of course a Watergate special prosecutor. Thanks to both of you for being here.</p><p>NICK AKERMAN, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: Great to be here.</p><p>MELBER: Nick, who needs to fall back?</p><p>AKERMAN: Who is to fall back is Roger Stone. I mean, him -- his Instagram account is absolutely his problem here. He`s got me on his Instagram page and he calls me a cranky old man. Now, first of all, I`m not cranky. You know that. And old -- well yes, but Roger Stone isn`t that much you know, we younger than me. And I`m also senile which he also claims.</p><p>MELBER: You get the feeling that Roger may have wanted to be an actor in another life?</p><p>JOHN TURTURRO, ACTOR: Well, a lot of these guys are actors. They`re more of an actor than I am actually.</p><p>MELBER: Really?</p><p>TURTURRO: Yes. I think there are many people in the political arena, I could never do what they do. Because I try to really believe what I`m doing and research what I`m doing so I understand something about the topic that I`m portraying.</p><p>MELBER: Yes. And John, who do you think -- what do you think needs to fall back?</p><p>TURTURRO: I think the oversimplification of any you know, news topic is something that really sort of bothers me, just the oversimplification. How they make everything into black and white. The void of in historical context. And so the loss of nuance I think is a major problem and that`s why these things like Instagram and you know, when you`re tweeting and everything, it`s the void of nuance.</p><p>MELBER: Do you think it`s something that is accelerated by the internet or is it in our nature as human beings to oversimplify?</p><p>TURTURRO: I think it`s been accelerated, absolutely.</p><p>MELBER: We heard you might do this and I have some examples to throw up here for you.</p><p>TURTURRO: Oh really?</p><p>MELBER: To see -- yes, because we heard you were -- this was on your mind.</p><p>TURTURRO: Oh God.</p><p>MELBER: Here`s one a headline that said, scientists, reveal three keys to happiness.</p><p>TURTURRO: Right.</p><p>MELBER: Oversimplified or not?</p><p>TURTURRO: Oversimplified.</p><p>MELBER: Are illegal immigrants, this headline says, the ones ruining America. Oversimplified?</p><p>TURTURRO: Oversimplified, yes. Yes. I mean, you know, these are complex topics and with complex solutions, you know, that once you demonize a whole group of people -- I mean, everyone was an immigrant and they`re talking about illegal immigrants, but that`s a complex topic.</p><p>MELBER: I got something that you guys have in common. You`ve done so many great performances, one of them that speaks to the Nick Akerman`s of the world was your portrayal of a very hardscrabble defense attorney in The Night Of on HBO. Let`s take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURTURRO: To the presumption of his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. We hear that term a lot, but what does it really mean? What`s its definition? It doesn`t have one. It`s what we think. And as much as what we think what we feel, and what we feel.</p><p>MELBER: Nick, how did he do?</p><p>AKERMAN: I thought he did pretty well. I mean, it was good. I mean, I -- the next trial I have you`re going to do my summation. I thought that was great. Now, I`m surprised the judge didn`t intervene because what`d you say there`s no definition of beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge gives a very specific charge on that. So this is like kind of a typical television or movie type portrayal.</p><p>MELBER: Oh my God. John --</p><p>TURTURRO: You have to take the liberty, you know.</p><p>MELBER: Leave it to Nick Akerman.</p><p>TURTURRO: I disagree with him.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, go ahead. Why?</p><p>TURTURRO: No, he`s right. He knows what he`s talking about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Nick Akerman to say, there would be an objection.</p><p>AKERMAN: Of course.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, of course, there would, but what did you think of the feeling and the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AKERMAN: No, but he was looking at the jury. He was being honest, he was coming -- he was basically connecting with people. And I think that`s what make a summation and a great trial.</p><p>MELBER: You felt so raw and real in that role. How did you get to that place?</p><p>TURTURRO: I spent a lot of time with a lot of lawyers who were very helpful to me. Every life is valuable so I don`t know how I would feel if I had someone`s life in my hands, you know. So that was the idea.</p><p>MELBER: There`s something very like gentle about you.</p><p>TURTURRO: Me? Well, I think gentleness is underrated. I think Abraham Lincoln said there`s nothing stronger than gentleness and I think that`s something in our society that there`s a great lack of. And -- because usually the wisest people, you know, it comes from a quiet place, not a loud place.</p><p>People who can hold your attention and take space and dominate the scene will be elected, but they may be the worst leaders and it`s -- you know, history has proved that many times over, may I add. But you know, I guess if it wasn`t for my business, probably, and a writer`s strike in the `90s, maybe reality television would have never happened.</p><p>And because of reality television, someone was able to hone a persona and bring him all the way up into the most powerful position in the country. And that is an essential thing because you learn like basic craft elements of how to keep someone`s attention. And people were convinced this was the character and it`s actually a fabrication of who the person actually was. And so you`ve seen this over and over you know, again.</p><p>MELBER: I think it`s a great reminder and a toast to gentility.</p><p>TURTURRO: OK.</p><p>MELBER: John Turturro --</p><p>TURTURRO: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Nick Akerman, thanks to both of you. And we will be right back. John`s film, I should mention, Gloria Bell in theaters now.</p><p>MELBER: What a week. We are out of time. I`ll be back next week, Monday, 6:00 p.m. Eastern. We`re going to cover those hearings for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone and a whole lot more. I`ll see you then. Have a great weekend.</p><p>HARDBALL with Chris Matthews is up next.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Thank you Chuck. We`re going to get right into it because we do have a very special show this Friday night. Senator Elizabeth Warren, she made some big news today with this plan to take on some major corporations. She`s my guest in studio tonight talking about that plan. There`s a lot of other news that is also going down today from the fallout over a Paul Manafort`s light sentence to where is this Mueller probe headed?  I`m going to get into all of it with her in this extensive interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is, we should mention, her first time on \"The Beat\" as a presidential candidate and that will be our very next segment.  Right now let me tell you the top story.  It was the sight today of the President of the United States openly sympathizing with a unrepentant convicted felon.  Now unrepentant is not a word that I`m telling you from my brain and our scripting or my planning, it`s literally how the judge overseeing this case, Judge Ellis, described guilty former Trump Campaign Chief Paul Manafort right before rewarding him with this very light prison sentence that was heard around the nation.</p><p>Donald Trump taking a different tack in talking about his former lawyer, Michael Cohen today who has been credited for some cooperation by Mueller.  He`s trying to draw Cohen into a new fight over whether Cohen ever asked for a pardon.  Now if that wasn`t enough, I could tell you the U.S. also got a weak jobs report today. Donald Trump lost his fifth communications director -- fifth. \"Fox News\" insider Bill Shine out.</p><p>And there are now reports that it was a leaker in Trump`s own White House who dished to democrats about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump`s nepotism scandal over security clearances. That`s happening right now and as Mueller gears up for Manafort`s second sentencing next week, I can also report for you I guess because it`s Friday and things are always happening in this other related case, this investigating WikiLeaks, a pretty famous witness Chelsea Manning was jailed today for refusing to talk.</p><p>All of that is going on. I want to begin with former federal prosecutor Seth Waxman whose last trial as a prosecutor was actually before Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the judge who will sentence Manafort for his crimes in the D.C. District next week. Great to have you tonight. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SETH WAXMAN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER:  Before we get to next week and before we get to Senator Warren who I`m telling viewers we`re going to get to, I want to get to what we learned from the Mueller side last night because they seem to be very clear on the record, they wanted the judge to know and now the world knows, they say Manafort was lying the whole time. What is the significance of that?</p><p>WAXMAN:  Well, it means that Mr. Manafort wasn`t coming forward, wasn`t being truthful. He has failed as a cooperator. The government has let the judge know that. They`re duty bound to describe the nature and extent of a potential -- a person being sentenced cooperation. And it seems very clear that he wasn`t giving the government much, if anything, during those many 50 hours.</p><p>They`ve made it clear that he didn`t do a lot for them so they haven`t done a lot for them in return. They`re going hard on him in Virginia. They got a lenient sentence there. I don`t expect it to be as lenient in D.C. next week.</p><p>MELBER:  I want to ask you about Judge Jackson going ahead to that. But before we get to that, take a listen to Manafort`s own lawyer bizarrely focusing on something that`s not an issue in either case. Kevin Downing last night, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, PAUL MANAFORT`S LAWYER:   I think most importantly what you saw today is the same thing that we had said from day one. There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved with any collusion with any government official from Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER:  Was it suspicious that he was focused on that?</p><p>WAXMAN:  Well, you know, there`s some suggestion that he`s out there trying to seek that pardon once again. I mean, it wasn`t an expressed request for a pardon. But you could see if you read between the lines, that he`s out there toeing the company line that there was no collusion.</p><p>MELBER:   It wasn`t - it wasn`t an express request but it was tantamount to him coming out and saying, \"Hey, everyone, CNN sucks or the inauguration crowd was large.\"  I mean, it had nothing to do with the victory that they`d just scored. You can give him legal credit. They got the result they wanted for their client. I mean Ellis gave less jail time than Manafort`s own lawyers had talked about him getting but it wasn`t about that and it`s not about next week so what else was it about?</p><p>WAXMAN:  Yes, I mean it sure does look like a play for a pardon. We know that seems to be out there. Mr. Trump himself has said I`m not taking anything off the table and that raises the question of obstruction of justice which is very troubling.</p><p>MELBER:  And then that brings us to your expertise. America has been going to law school together. People are learning names of judges they might never know. Judge Ellis now people have come to learn about and we`re going to talk about some of the disparities and racial justice issues in his courtroom in a minute.  But as for Judge Jackson, who`s next week going to make a final call here, what can you tell us about her having been before her?</p><p>WAXMAN: Yes, I did my last trial as a federal prosecutor back in 2015 in front of her.  She is a highly-respected judge.  She does not suffer fools lightly and I will tell you just like every judge in this country, when they let a person stay out of jail pending trial and that person goes out</p><p>She does not suffer fools lightly. And I will tell you just like every judge in this country, when they let a person stay out of jail pending trial and that person goes out and flouts the judge`s orders and thumbs their nose or puts it right in the judge`s face and goes out and commits additional crimes, judges despise that. So I know Judge Berman Jackson is going to hold that against Mr. Manafort and in addition it`s kind of an unique case in that the sentencing guidelines are way above the maximum sentence that Judge Berman Jackson can give which is ten years. The defense has agreed that that guideline range which is upwards of 17 to 21 years is a reasonable sentence and should be sentenced within that guideline range.</p><p>MELBER:  So you think it could be a tough -- tougher day next week?</p><p>WAXMAN:  Yes, no question.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes, Seth Waxman who`s been there, thank you.</p><p>I want to turn now as promised. I`m joined by Melissa Murray. We`re going to walk through something so important even if you`d already heard about it which is that there is racial injustice in criminal sentencing. Thank you for being here.</p><p>MELISSA MURRAY, INTERIM DEAN AND PROFESSOR OF LAW AT BOALT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW:  Shocking.</p><p>MELBER:  So let`s walk through this. Manafort had a pretty light sentence and it`s a reminder of the blatant inequities in our justice system. Take a look at this recent study, 2017, from the sentencing commission which found black male offenders received sentences that are 19 percent longer than similarly situated white male offenders and that`s  just when you get to  the sentencing stage and the facts.</p><p>Then let`s look at Judge Ellis more narrowly. This is the person who sentenced Paul Manafort and hasn`t shied away in some cases although he is a critic of prosecutors at times but let`s look at what he`s done in other cases in the past, 2009. Here`s former Congressman Jefferson, and Judge Ellis handled him for financial crimes, not violence, a 13-year sentence over corruption. It was at the time the longest sentence ever for a Congressman. So when you look at this argument that maybe financial crimes are not sentenced to the max, that wasn`t true there for Judge Ellis and it`s not true around the country.</p><p>Here`s former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.  He was sentenced to 28 years in 2013, the max.  It was a corruption case. His coconspirator got 21 years, a little under the 28-year maximum. Unlike Paul Manafort, Mayor Kilpatrick also talked to the court about his remorse. He said quote, \"He really, really, really messed up and took full responsibility for all his actions.\"   NYU`s Law Professor Melissa Murray, a former clerk at times to then Judge Sotomayor.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>MELISSA MURRAY, INTERIM DEAN AND PROFESSOR OF LAW AT BOALT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW:   Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER:  Let`s get into it. Because Judge Ellis is more critical of prosecutors and I want to note that to be accurate. But this was a record-breaking sentence for Jefferson in his courtroom. Mr. Kilpatrick we showed there also didn`t live a blameless life. But these were all African-American males.</p><p>MURRAY:  So it should come as no surprise to anyone who has been watching the news or even listening to casual observers that there are serious disparities on the basis of race in the criminal justice system, both at the charging stage where the charges are levied and all the way through to sentencing. That shouldn`t be shocking. The fact that it is being raised in such a blatant way in this particular case is actually newsworthy. Judge Ellis.</p><p>MELBER:  You`re saying this is even worse than what someone familiar with how racist the system can be in its operation?</p><p>MURRAY:  Likely because of the political overlay. This is not your average run of the mill case with any random ...</p><p>MELBER:  Certainly not.</p><p>MURRAY: . so this is unusual. The political overlay is really unusual here. I don`t think that we should necessarily be skeptical of a judge who questions the severity of criminal sentences.</p><p>MELBER:  Sure.</p><p>MURRAY:  And Judge Ellis has consistently done that.</p><p>MELBER:  As mentioned.</p><p>MURRAY:  There have been cases where he has challenged the mandatory minimum and has sentenced the mandatory minimum because it is mandatory but he`s expressed real reservations about severe sentences.  The problem I think with this case is it does look so jarring in light of everything that has happened and in light of the observations that the judge has made. The idea Paul Manafort has had a blameless life is ludicrous in light of the fact that he has lied to the special counsel. That he has been charged in another jurisdiction with obstruction of justice. This is not a blameless individual. This is an individual who hasn`t gotten caught yet.</p><p>MELBER:  We should be clear when it`s a complete automatic mandatory - judges can talk about what they think about it .</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER: . but they don`t have the legal freedom to do anything different.</p><p>MURRAY:  Exactly.</p><p>MELBER:  With the sentencing guidelines, that`s when you get into the discretion and the choice.</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  And its pretty telling that Judge Ellis looked at all of this including the post indictment obstruction and then the attacks on Mueller through the plea deal that Manafort blew up for himself and then the statement in court that didn`t even repent and still came down so differently than Congressman Jefferson. Do you think this is a situation where judges don`t even realize their own blind spots?</p><p>MURRY:  I don`t know. Judge Ellis, I`ve never seen Judge Ellis unlike Seth Waxman. All I can say about the situation is that there are true disparities here. This is a four year -- less than a four-year sentence on truly serious crimes versus 13 years also for financial crimes. And Judge Ellis has noted that the severity of these sentences has real consequences for the offender, for their families.  All of that was true in the case of Bill Jefferson and all of that will be true for Paul Manafort but the difference between 4 years and 13 years is really sizable especially in a case with the political implications this one has.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes, it`s quite a -- we have it on the screen behind us. These are two faces. This is the face of two people who were involved in politics who were convicted of bad things. Right? So the question isn`t are either of them great. The question is why does the other face, Paul Manafort here behind me, why does that face look so different in our system and is treated to different than Jefferson? There is also just the general fact that some of this is cooky even beyond race, there`s class and other dynamics.  You were talking about survivor star Richard Hatch. Tell us about that. We`ll put it on the screen.</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.  So if you`re a pulp culture aficionado, as I am, you know Richard Hatch was the first winner of \"Survivor\" and when he received those winnings, he did not pay taxes on them. He was later charged in the District of Rhode Island of tax evasion and he served 51 months in prison - or he was sentenced to 51 months in prison for that crime. Tax evasion, a really serious crime, as serious as the fraud and tax fraud charges that Paul Manafort was up against here. The difference between 51 months and 47 months again not that sizable but again the political overlay makes this look a little more complicated and I think it`s unusual that given everything, given that Judge Ellis recognized that Paul Manafort had had not expressed remorse, that there were these issues of lying to the prosecutors even though he was supposed to be cooperating.  That nonetheless Judge Ellis came to the conclusion that Paul Manafort had otherwise lived a blameless life.</p><p>MELBER:  Right, and I`m not here to search inside the judge`s soul. I can`t do that as a reporter but I am here to show the facts and the discrepancies and the system that we`ve been documenting and reporting on for some time which grinds down African-Americans and people of color and explicitly and especially African-American males. And so to have it all pop off.</p><p>MURRAY:  And women. There`s also the issue of Crystal Mason who registered to vote not realizing as a former convicted felon that she was ineligible to do so.</p><p>MELBER:  And didn`t even have the requisite intent and got years.</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes, five years.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes I know but I think when you look at the assumptions that are made about whether someone is blameless and the type of life they`ve led, I think that goes to a final point that I think can be confusing that I think we need to reflect on more which is empathy and sympathy are really great human emotions when we deal with them day to day but there`s a reason they`re not supposed to govern a fair and equal system of law that is supposed to be standard for everyone.  Because it seems that when empathy comes up in some of these places, it`s some sort of beltway swamp empathy for only certain types of people.</p><p>MURRAY:  Well it also raises the point that elections matter.  Judge Ellis is on the bench because he is a Reagan appointee. President Trump has at this point in his tenure in office, appointed more judges than President Obama. These are judges who again, the diversity of the bench matters. This is not necessarily a situation where this judge might be as sympathetic or empathetic with other kinds of defendants.</p><p>MELBER:  Melissa Murray gets the last word on this one.  Thank you for being here tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>MURRAY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MELBER:  Up next, we fit in a quick break and then we`re going to get into it, my exclusive sit down interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren right here in New York making news with this big plan to break up tech giants like Amazon and Google.  She`s one of the biggest names right now in the presidential race.  She`s at 30 Rock and later, don`t think we forgot.  We still got a \"Fall Back\" for you.  Actor John Turturro who has played a lawyer on TV and Nick Ackerman who has played a lawyer on TV.  I`m telling you it`s a big show. Please stick around, we`ll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELBER:  Senator Elizabeth Warren is one of the most famous democrats running for president right now. And she`s in New York today unveiling a big plan to take on corporations. Something that I think is fair to say she`s known for. But specifically corporations which have actually proven popular among voters and among a lot of democratic donors which makes this in itself pretty interesting.</p><p>She`s also heading into this interview at a pretty busy time in the Mueller probe, you may have heard. Let`s just say we have a lot to get to and we`re going to do it right now. Senator Elizabeth Warren here for the interview in 30 seconds.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELBER:  Joining me now is Senator Elizabeth Warren democrat from Massachusetts and a 2020 presidential candidate. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS:  Thank you. I`m delighted to be here.</p><p>MELBER:  You have criticized a lot of big banks. Today you`re talking about breaking up big tech. Why?</p><p>WARREN:  So here`s the deal, we need real competition in this field and there`s a problem. So Amazon, Google, they own a platform which is pretty cool, right where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say, to Amazon in order to sell their goods.</p><p>And they don`t just compete straight up. They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide, oh. I`m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect.   It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team. My view is you can do one, be an umpire, or the other, own a team. But you don`t get to do both at the same time.</p><p>MELBER:  Right and you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You dropped this plan today. This is your first big TV interview about it. Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Senator Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Warren rolling out one of her big policy plans, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen to date from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A  huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s big, and it`s bold, and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER:  Could she really do it?  What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN:  You bet.  The answer is yes, but you know let`s be really clear about this.  If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at -- you know, 63 choices and get the one that`s going to be there in 48 hours.  You can still do that as a consumer.  This preserves the platform.</p><p>If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it.  What this is about is about competition, it`s about all those little businesses and start-up businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon, or on Google and who are at an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google -- if they like the money they see that you`re making because they get all the information, they decide to go in to competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER:  Let`s go through some of these companies so we can all understand.</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes or no, and then we`ll get in to them.</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>MELBER:  Do you view them as operating monopolies?  Google?</p><p>WARREN:  So Google, yes -- pretty much in a monopoly.</p><p>MELBER:  Amazon?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, yes.  They`ve got - can we just do on Amazon, 49 percent .</p><p>MELBER:  Well I`m going to go forward, Facebook?  Yes?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  Apple?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  OK, so let`s look at Facebook first and then we`ll go through each of them.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  So Mr. Zuckerberg disagrees with you, take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is Twitter the same as what you do?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It overlaps a portion of what we do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don`t think you have a monopoly?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn`t feel like that to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MELBER:  Is he wrong?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  Because he has the Facebook platform, that`s the key part here.  So if you want to check on what your college roommates are up to, you`ve got to go to his platform.  And the part that gets me and I really want to describe at this way, monopoly power is that so many folks have got to come to his platform to be able to transact.  He wants to be able to sell ads for example, on that.  The problem is he`s scooping all this information up.</p><p>MELBER:  He`s -- Facebook is your arm in this analogy?  OK.</p><p>WARREN:  OK, this is the platform.  That`s exactly right.</p><p>MELBER:  And then what goes on?</p><p>WARREN:  And then what happens is he uses all this information and then makes the decisions about how to scoop up others in the marketplace.  For example, he runs a buy and sell for ads.  So he`s in every position on that -- a buyer of ads, a seller of ads and running the little platform where those are sold.</p><p>That just creates an enormous competitive advantage and here`s the problem on every one of these, these advantages are now so enormous that venture capitalists are starting to say, \"Wait a minute if you`re going to go in to a space where you could in some way be challenging Amazon, or be challenging Facebook or be challenging Google -- it is now referred to as the kill zone.\"</p><p>And venture capital has gone down, investment by about 20 percent over the past five years or so because they`re just saying it doesn`t make any sense.</p><p>MELBER:  So if you plan is enacted, does each of those companies get somewhat broken up?</p><p>WARREN:  So what they did is the platform gets broken off from the individual companies. That`s what I`m saying.</p><p>MELBER:  And you think that`s good for consumers?</p><p>WARREN:  It`s excellent for consumers because it not only means the platform will be level.  You`re not getting something from Amazon pushed out in front of you, and a better competitor hidden back on page six.  It also means the next good idea has a chance to mature and develop.</p><p>MELBER:  Right, but Amazon just like everyone remembers as booksellers is not going to be knee tapping everyone, then you.</p><p>WARREN:  That`s right.</p><p>MELBER:  Then you -- you`re here on \"The Beat\" tonight announcing this plan today and you`re campaigning in Long Island City.</p><p>WARREN:  I am.</p><p>MELBER:  . where Amazon just pulled out, is that deliberate?</p><p>WARREN:  That`s right, you bet it`s deliberate.</p><p>MELBER:  What are you saying?</p><p>WARREN:  What I`m talking about is how big these tech giants have gotten, so that what we see -- and we saw right there on Long Island City.  Is they come in, they bully towns, cities, states all around the country.</p><p>You know the handful of tech giants have gotten more than $10 billion in breaks from towns, and cities, and states over the past few years.</p><p>MELBER:  Corporate welfare...</p><p>WARREN:  That`s right, but.</p><p>MELBER:  So let me ask you this, is that a problem with the incentives or was New York wrong to give them that much of an offer?</p><p>WARREN:  The problem - the problem is the \"Hunger Games\" about it because that`s what`s happening here, and it`s a problem because it creates more concentration in the industry.  You know, they`re not offering the cities and towns a zillion bucks in goodies and tax breaks to the entrepreneur whose getting started, to the small business that`s trying to make a go of it.  Even to the medium-sized business and big business that want to grow more -- nope.</p><p>This is about the giants who are able to swagger in to town and say, \"Lay in front of me what you`re going to offer and I`ll decide if I like it or not, and then I`ll go somewhere else and see what they`ll offer.  And by the way, if you start asking me hard questions about the jobs, about where the money`s going to come from, about how much guarantee I`m putting in to this -- I`ll just get mad and go somewhere else.\"</p><p>MELBER:  So your new plan also talks a lot about antitrust.  You`ve been critical of the AT&amp;T merger with CNN`s parent company.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  So has Donald Trump, but \"The New Yorker\" reported this week his reason was he wanted to use those powers to beat up on CNN.</p><p>WARREN:  That`s right.</p><p>MELBER:  Is that wrong, and if so what do you do about it?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, it`s very wrong.  For the president to say I want to see an antitrust prosecution based on political advantage to the president, is about as wrong as it gets.  What I want to see is antitrust enforcement, because it protects markets, because it protects small competitors, because it protects consumers over the long run.</p><p>MELBER:  So how do you deal with what he has allegedly done?  And should there be punishment for that?</p><p>WARREN:  Well I think we need -- I mean, I think there`s going to be a very serious investigation about this.  There`s a fundamental question about whether what he`s done is even legal.</p><p>MELBER:  Would that -- that may have been a legal way to attack CNN?</p><p>WARREN:  May have been.</p><p>MELBER:  Interesting, which they happen to be a competitor but we`re interested in more of the free press issue.  Let`s go to the way the Treasury Department is run, because you look at it right now and I`ll draw your attention to a very simple illustration.  Under Donald Trump, we can put up on the screen you have in the red zone there, Goldman Sachs.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  . as part of Treasury Department leadership.</p><p>If you go back in the Obama era we checked and as you know we had Goldman Sachs former executives running Treasury then.  Go back to Bush, also Goldman Sachs.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  You go back to Bill Clinton, also Goldman Sachs.  In a Warren Administration would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN:  Nope.</p><p>MELBER:  Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  Oh, that`s easy.</p><p>MELBER:  That`s a litmus test?</p><p>WARREN:  Absolutely.  But let me tell you why, the problem we`ve got right now is a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington that causes everybody to be on this (ph) for -- wait a minute, the next time this Treasury Secretary puts forward a proposal is it because it really helps the economy, helps the American consumer, helps the American homeowner?</p><p>Or is it because it helps their former and possibly future employer?  Let`s just do for one second the Gary Cohn example -- another Goldman Sachs, you remember.</p><p>MELBER:  Oh, I`m sure.</p><p>WARREN:  That`s exactly right.  So Trump appoints Gary Cohn, he leaves Goldman Sachs and Gary Cohn is going to have exactly one job.  And that is to ramrod through a rewrite of the tax laws that will profoundly affect Goldman Sachs.  So what does Goldman Sachs do as Gary walks out the door?  They hand him nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, it`s a gift -- they don`t have to.</p><p>MELBER:  Is it legal bribery?</p><p>WARREN:  I think of it as a pre-bribe.</p><p>MELBER:  Pre-bribe?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  So Gary then goes out and guess what he does?   He writes a tax law and manages to help ramrod it through that benefits Goldman Sachs to the tune of oh, a quarter of a billion dollars in the first go-round.</p><p>MELBER:  And what you`re saying.</p><p>WARREN:  And then it`s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>MELBER:  What you`re saying makes sense, and we have such ripe targets, I think people could understand what you`re pointing to.  But what does it mean for the Democratic Party if this was also how Obama and Clinton ran the Treasury?  Would you be a fundamental break with that, I guess is the question?</p><p>WARREN:  Well the problem -- I have written the biggest anticorruption bill since Watergate.  Because we have a fundamental problem in Washington, and understand it`s a problem that predates Trump by decades.</p><p>MELBER:  Right.</p><p>WARREN:  Trump may be the most extreme example now, the pre-bribe of Gary Cohn for example.  But we have a longstanding problem, and that`s the influence of money on decision making in Washington.</p><p>So this bill has lots of pieces to it, including closing the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington.  Ending lobbying as we know it.  Putting a real ethics cop on the beat, saying that the heads of these agencies cannot be trading in stocks .</p><p>MELBER:  Right, so as a political matter are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money?</p><p>WARREN:  Maybe.  But this isn`t about the money.  This is about how it is we`re kind of make this country work again not just for the rich of the powerful.  How we`re going to make it work for everyone.  You know, we live in America right now where Washington works great for giant drug companies, just not for people are trying fill a prescription.</p><p>MELBER:  So you talk about -- this is -- you talk about how the Beltway works.  Everyone has been talking about the rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got.  When you look at that, does that reflect what you`re saying when Washington works well for the connected in the affluent and nobody else?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  It`s two justice systems.  Look at the words carved above the United States Supreme Court.  Equal justice under law.  But look at the reality.  People who got buckets of money and a well-connected get treated with kid gloves.</p><p>MELBER:  So do you think --</p><p>WARREN:  Everybody else doesn`t.</p><p>MELBER:  Do you think when you look at that statistically, that a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, we know the data on this.  Of course, the sentence would have been different.  In fact, study after study after study shows that for the exact same crime, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be prosecuted, to be wrongfully convicted, and to receive harsher sentences.  Race matters in our criminal justice system and it is not a system of equal justice under law.</p><p>MELBER:  On the bullet probe, I read a pledge you recently made.  You said -- this is interesting.  You would issue \"no pardons for anyone implicated in the investigations into Donald Trump.\"  How can you know that before the investigations are over?  Would that include someone like Andy McCabe, the former acting FBI director who was under investigation right now and in the D.C. office?</p><p>WARREN:  Because I know what pardons are for.  Pardons are there for the powerless to show a little justice that they need.  Pardons are not there as part of a plea agreement.  That`s somewhere else in the system.  We reserve pardons for those people who didn`t receive justice under the law.  And I`m not there to say pardons are going to be part of a political horse trade of my administration.</p><p>MELBER:  Does that mean you would commit to saying you`re never going to pardon anyone that worked directly for you?</p><p>WARREN:  I assume so.  I mean I don`t know if any case why I would do that.  This is about the powerless.  That`s what pardons are supposed to be about.  Not about people who have connections, not about people who -- not about people who have a way to be protected, who can hire the lawyers, who get to work their way through the system, who get the best representation.  Pardons are about one last way that we try to put a little justice back into a system that today is very unjust.</p><p>MELBER:  If Bob Mueller finishes this probe with no further indictments, so they don`t indict anyone in America for helping the Russians collude, what do you think then is the conclusion and two people who were hoping this would all bust Donald Trump have to accept those lawful findings even if they don`t go far as far as somewhat?</p><p>WARREN:  I don`t know what his reports are going to say and we just have to wait and see.  But I`ll tell you this about this report that it has already produced nearly three dozen indictments or guilty pleas.  This is a serious investigation.  In addition to that, we`ve got investigations that are going on in other jurisdictions and the House has just started its own series of investigations.</p><p>You know, the sound of hoof beats of all those investigations catching up with Donald Trump must be loud in his ears.</p><p>MELBER:  I want to ask you about some politics and some of the fun stuff, what makes you tick.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>MELBER:  On the politics, the Democratic Party`s announced you guys aren`t going to do any debates with Fox News.  Is that the right call?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, this is ultimately a decision for the -- for the party to make, but I dounderstand that when more and more keeps coming out about how Fox News was just operating as an arm of the Trump campaign and then the Trump administration, boy that doesn`t much look like we really have a free and independent press.  It just looks like a propaganda machine.</p><p>MELBER:  So you agree with the chairman.</p><p>WARREN:  So I understand -- I understand why it is that the Democratic Party would say we`re just not going to be a part of that.  And I -- you know, look, I want to be able to get out and talk to everyone.  I mean, I`ll just tell you that as a candidate.  I want to be and everybody`s living room.  I want a chance to reach out to everyone.</p><p>MELBER:  And that makes sense.  I guess the thing we heard from a lot of activists was while you may go talk to whoever you choose to, why should as you put it, an entity that was perceived as being an arm of the Trump administration help pick who runs against Trump?</p><p>WARREN:  And I think that`s part of why the Democratic Party as a party since we got a real problem here.</p><p>MELBER:  Mike Bloomberg, do you want his endorsement?</p><p>WARREN:  What -- I`m glad to have everybody`s endorsement but I`m not out looking for any of them.</p><p>MELBER:  You`re not going to ask -- you`re not asking Mr. Bloomberg?</p><p>WARREN:  Not asking.</p><p>MELBER:  OK.  Bernie Sanders has more individual donors right now than any other Dem candidate by a long ways.  Is that because he`s really popular with the grassroots or is it because he`s good at raising money?</p><p>WARREN:  I assume it`s because he`s popular with the grassroots.  Bernie has been out there fighting his fight and you know that`s got a lot of people energized.</p><p>MELBER:  Is he the front-runner?</p><p>WARREN:  I -- you need a pundit for this, but it sure looks like it.  I mean --</p><p>MELBER:  It does look like it.</p><p>WARREN:  Punditry is not my business but --</p><p>MELBER:  Not your thing.  Let me ask you something I was wondering because you spent most of your life in other types of yeah service.  How old were you when you first thought I think I might run for office?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh golly.  Well, let`s see.  I could just do the math but I was in my 60s.  I never was going to do this.</p><p>MELBER:  When you were teaching, this was not the next step?</p><p>WARREN:  Not even close.</p><p>MELBER:  I`m going to run through a couple of quick ones.  They`re fun or at least maybe nerdy fun.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>MELBER:  And we could do them as fast as possible.  We call it a lightning round sometimes.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>MELBER:  Past or present, favorite member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh Janet Yellen.</p><p>MELBER:  Janet Yellen?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh she`s -- she is fabulous.</p><p>MELBER:  International Women`s Day, a woman past or present who inspires you.</p><p>WARREN:   Oh let me think, Bella Abzug.  You know, a woman who just got out there and fought for what she believed in.  I love it.</p><p>MELBER:  I`ve got a couple one-word associations.  If you could do it in a word.  Some of them relate to your bill.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>MELBER:  Amazon?</p><p>WARREN:  Can I have two words?</p><p>MELBER:  Sure.</p><p>WARREN:  Too big.</p><p>MELBER:  Google.</p><p>WARREN:  Too big.</p><p>MELBER:  Facebook.</p><p>WARREN:  Too big.</p><p>MELBER:  Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN:  Too powerful.  And that`s really the point of the two bigs it`s they`ve got too much power and they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors, and ultimately to change the consumer experience.  We got to change that.</p><p>MELBER:  Favorite song to work out to.</p><p>WARREN:  Anything from Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER:  Patsy Cline.  Favorite --</p><p>WARREN:  I love Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER:  Favorite album or artist when you were growing up.</p><p>WARREN:  Any of the Beatles.</p><p>MELBER:  Beatles?</p><p>WARREN:  Probably the White Album.</p><p>MELBER:  Now I got to know your favorite Beatle.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh no, that`s not fair.  That`s like asking your favorite child.</p><p>MELBER:  I would guess and what do I know.  I don`t know you that well.  I would guess Lennon.  George Harrison?  Boom.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  Your dream running mate throughout history living or dead.  You could pick a person that would run with you.</p><p>WARREN:  Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>MELBER:  A Republican?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  Because he took on the trusts?</p><p>WARREN:  Because he was brave, and he took on the trust and he didn`t care how many people were going to be mad about it, and he did it.  This is what`s amazing for the right reasons.  It wasn`t just that they were big.  It wasn`t just that they were dominating an economy.  It wasn`t just that they were putting farmers out of business and competitors out of business and small companies out of business,  it was that they had too much political power.</p><p>And it was the very fact of that political power that caused Teddy Roosevelt to say I`m going to be a trust buster.  Man, I`d like to have that guy at my side.</p><p>MELBER:  There is a beloved actress who`s been talking about you, Annette Bening.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  Let`s take a look.  I think we have this for you.  Annette Bening says she knows she looks like Elizabeth Warren.  Thank you very much.  Now, did she look like you or do you look like her?</p><p>WARREN:  Either way.  I`m totally happy with this comparison.</p><p>MELBER:  You like this.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, I do.</p><p>MELBER:  Would you be comfortable if and when and then there`s a Warren movie, would you be comfortable with her playing you.</p><p>WARREN:  I`m all in.</p><p>MELBER:  You`re ready for that.</p><p>WARREN:  I`m ready.</p><p>MELBER:  Have you guys ever met?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, actually.</p><p>MELBER:  And?</p><p>WARREN:  Once.  I think she actually does -- we kind of look like each other.</p><p>MELBER:  Did you talk about it at the time?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  Just a little bit.</p><p>MELBER:  How could you not?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, how could we not.</p><p>MELBER:  We have to ask before we let you go how Bailey is doing.  This dog is beloved on your campaign.</p><p>WARREN:  This dog is the best.  Between the Bailey cam and the opportunity to meet people and voters and people been bringing him little treats.  So Bailey is filling out now for a ten-month-old dog.</p><p>MELBER:  And he has his own greeting line as well as you.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh man, he does a photo line like you wouldn`t believe.  And I want to be really clear about this, Ari, it is not a competition.</p><p>MELBER:  No.</p><p>WARREN:  I say this because I definitely do not want to be in competition with a ten-month-old golden retriever.</p><p>MELBER:  I`ve seen him.  I`m a dog person myself.  I`m sure he could get a lot of individual donors as well if he goes in that direction.</p><p>WARREN:  That`s right.</p><p>MELBER:  Senator Warren, coming here on the day of your big tech announcement, we really appreciate it.  I hope you`ll come back on THE BEAT.</p><p>WARREN:  Good.</p><p>MELBER:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>MELBER:  Senate Elizabeth Warren.  And we will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELBER:  Senator Elizabeth Warren on THE BEAT making some news right here.  A new pledge, a revelation on who she says the front-runner is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER:  The rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got, a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence.</p><p>WARREN:  Of course the sentence would have been different.</p><p>MELBER:  Corporate welfare, was New York wrong to give him up that much of an offer.</p><p>WARREN:  No, the problem is the Hunger Games.</p><p>MELBER:  In a Warren administration, would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running in the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN:  Nope.</p><p>MELBER:  Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>MELBER:  Are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money?</p><p>WARREN:  Maybe.</p><p>MELBER:  Bernie Sanders has more individual donors right now.  Is he the front-runner?</p><p>WARREN:  I -- you need a pundit for this, but it sure looks like it.</p><p>MELBER:  Google.</p><p>WARREN:  Too big.</p><p>MELBER:  Facebook.</p><p>WARREN:  Too big.</p><p>MELBER:  Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN:  Too powerful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER:  Too powerful.  Just some highlights of our discussion.  Now next we go -- it`s Friday, we go to \"FALLBACK FRIDAY\" with the actor John Turturro and our own Nick Akerman, that`s next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELBER:  It`s time for a special edition of \"FALLBACK.\"  I`m joined by Emmy award-winning actor John Turturro, currently starring in the film Gloria Bell along with Julianne Moore.  Other notable films include Quiz Show, Michael Bay`s Transformers franchise, and of course the collaborations with the Coen brothers including the unforgettable role as Jesus Quintana in The Big Lebowski, one of our favorites.</p><p>Turturro also played a scrappy lawyer in the HBO hit The Night Of which is something he has in common with our other guest Nick Akerman, also plays a lawyer on television and was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District and of course a Watergate special prosecutor.  Thanks to both of you for being here.</p><p>NICK AKERMAN, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST:  Great to be here.</p><p>MELBER:  Nick, who needs to fall back?</p><p>AKERMAN:  Who is to fall back is Roger Stone.  I mean, him -- his Instagram account is absolutely his problem here.  He`s got me on his Instagram page and he calls me a cranky old man.  Now, first of all, I`m not cranky.  You know that.  And old -- well yes, but Roger Stone isn`t that much you know, we younger than me.  And I`m also senile which he also claims.</p><p>MELBER:  You get the feeling that Roger may have wanted to be an actor in another life?</p><p>JOHN TURTURRO, ACTOR:  Well, a lot of these guys are actors.  They`re more of an actor than I am actually.</p><p>MELBER:  Really?</p><p>TURTURRO:  Yes.  I think there are many people in the political arena, I could never do what they do.  Because I try to really believe what I`m doing and research what I`m doing so I understand something about the topic that I`m portraying.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes.  And John, who do you think -- what do you think needs to fall back?</p><p>TURTURRO:  I think the oversimplification of any you know, news topic is something that really sort of bothers me, just the oversimplification.  How they make everything into black and white.  The void of in historical context.  And so the loss of nuance I think is a major problem and that`s why these things like Instagram and you know, when you`re tweeting and everything, it`s the void of nuance.</p><p>MELBER:  Do you think it`s something that is accelerated by the internet or is it in our nature as human beings to oversimplify?</p><p>TURTURRO:  I think it`s been accelerated, absolutely.</p><p>MELBER:  We heard you might do this and I have some examples to throw up here for you.</p><p>TURTURRO:  Oh really?</p><p>MELBER:  To see -- yes, because we heard you were -- this was on your mind.</p><p>TURTURRO:  Oh God.</p><p>MELBER:  Here`s one a headline that said, scientists, reveal three keys to happiness.</p><p>TURTURRO:  Right.</p><p>MELBER:  Oversimplified or not?</p><p>TURTURRO:  Oversimplified.</p><p>MELBER:  Are illegal immigrants, this headline says, the ones ruining America.  Oversimplified?</p><p>TURTURRO:  Oversimplified, yes.  Yes.  I mean, you know, these are complex topics and with complex solutions, you know, that once you demonize a whole group of people -- I mean, everyone was an immigrant and they`re talking about illegal immigrants, but that`s a complex topic.</p><p>MELBER:  I got something that you guys have in common.  You`ve done so many great performances, one of them that speaks to the Nick Akerman`s of the world was your portrayal of a very hardscrabble defense attorney in The Night Of on HBO.  Let`s take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURTURRO:  To the presumption of his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.  We hear that term a lot, but what does it really mean?  What`s its definition?  It doesn`t have one.  It`s what we think.  And as much as what we think what we feel, and what we feel.</p><p>MELBER:  Nick, how did he do?</p><p>AKERMAN:  I thought he did pretty well.  I mean, it was good.  I mean, I -- the next trial I have you`re going to do my summation.  I thought that was great.  Now, I`m surprised the judge didn`t intervene because what`d you say there`s no definition of beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge gives a very specific charge on that.  So this is like kind of a typical television or movie type portrayal.</p><p>MELBER:  Oh my God.  John --</p><p>TURTURRO:  You have to take the liberty, you know.</p><p>MELBER:  Leave it to Nick Akerman.</p><p>TURTURRO:  I disagree with him.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes, go ahead.  Why?</p><p>TURTURRO:  No, he`s right.  He knows what he`s talking about.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER:  Nick Akerman to say, there would be an objection.</p><p>AKERMAN:  Of course.</p><p>MELBER:  Yes, of course, there would, but what did you think of the feeling and the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AKERMAN:  No, but he was looking at the jury.  He was being honest, he was coming -- he was basically connecting with people.  And I think that`s what make a summation and a great trial.</p><p>MELBER:  You felt so raw and real in that role.  How did you get to that place?</p><p>TURTURRO:  I spent a lot of time with a lot of lawyers who were very helpful to me.  Every life is valuable so I don`t know how I would feel if I had someone`s life in my hands, you know.  So that was the idea.</p><p>MELBER:  There`s something very like gentle about you.</p><p>TURTURRO:  Me?  Well, I think gentleness is underrated.  I think Abraham Lincoln said there`s nothing stronger than gentleness and I think that`s something in our society that there`s a great lack of.  And -- because usually the wisest people, you know, it comes from a quiet place, not a loud place.</p><p>People who can hold your attention and take space and dominate the scene will be elected, but they may be the worst leaders and it`s -- you know, history has proved that many times over, may I add.  But you know, I guess if it wasn`t for my business, probably, and a writer`s strike in the `90s, maybe reality television would have never happened.</p><p>And because of reality television, someone was able to hone a persona and bring him all the way up into the most powerful position in the country.  And that is an essential thing because you learn like basic craft elements of how to keep someone`s attention.  And people were convinced this was the character and it`s actually a fabrication of who the person actually was.  And so you`ve seen this over and over you know, again.</p><p>MELBER:  I think it`s a great reminder and a toast to gentility.</p><p>TURTURRO:  OK.</p><p>MELBER:  John Turturro --</p><p>TURTURRO:  Thank you.</p><p>MELBER:  Nick Akerman, thanks to both of you.  And we will be right back.  John`s film, I should mention, Gloria Bell in theaters now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELBER:  What a week.  We are out of time.  I`ll be back next week, Monday, 6:00 p.m. Eastern.  We`re going to cover those hearings for Paul Manafort and Roger Stone and a whole lot more.  I`ll see you then.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>HARDBALL with Chris Matthews is up next.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Americans have been, of course, now leaning into the holidays, stepping back from a year where Donald Trump`s actions certainly caught up with him, facing a December impeachment, an existential crisis for the Trump Presidency after a news year consumed by his mistakes and scandals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I`m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.</p><p>MELBER: They are under fire from all sides for this whistleblower complaint.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: They`d start a major investigation into the Bidens.</p><p>MELBER: Donald Trump busted for making good on his infamous claim he would take foreign help in 2020.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment is imperative.</p><p>MELBER: --that the President committed crimes in office.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you say impeach?</p><p>MELBER: So that is a thing.</p><p>The case for bribery is straightforward. And everyone knows bribery is impeachable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that`s why we held up the money. We do that all the time with foreign policy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But to be clear, you just described is a quid pro quo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell me what rule, law or statute has been violated by the President--</p><p>MELBER: Do you want to point to statutes? That`s not required, but it is--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes, but tell me about the--</p><p>MELBER: Hold on. And then I`ll you respond, sir. It is unlawful to solicit or receive any foreign help, which includes things of value.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think what it - I think, for a citizen, it set off some alarms.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because that`s obviously shady?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it`s pretty damning evidence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Damning slam dunk evidence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An incredibly damning admission that you can`t trust the President not to commit crimes.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery.</p><p>PELOSI: That`s it. It`s perfectly wrong. It`s bribery.</p><p>MELBER: A week unlike any other in the Trump era. Nine different Trump administration insiders who joined 12 other witnesses who`ve now provided over 30 hours of testimony in the--</p><p>GORDON SONDLAND, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION: Was there a quid pro quo? The answer is yes.</p><p>MELBER (voice-over): Here is the most important shift in all the testimony to-date. Sondland moves over, suddenly saying, yes, this was bribery.</p><p>FIONA HILL, FORMER TOP RUSSIA EXPERT AT U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: He was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged.</p><p>SONDLAND: Everyone was in the loop.</p><p>MELBER: His personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is in Ukraine today, of all places. He says he`s meeting with prosecutors, which are of course also potential witnesses.</p><p>To paraphrase Biggie Smalls, he is going going back back to Kyiv Kyiv.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a crime spree in progress. And that gives us an urgency to act.</p><p>MELBER: Rudy Giuliani is pulling off--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Getting Donald Trump impeached.</p><p>The House will do what many thought it was on its way to do, impeach President Trump, starting now.</p><p>PELOSI: I`m asking our Chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): This lawless President has taken advantage of the public trust.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): --committing high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>MELBER: You absolutely have a Constitution that provides for a very quick remedy to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve got President Trump who`s basically out-Nixoning Nixon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An extraordinary breach of the powers of the Presidency.</p><p>MELBER: It is a vote that actually changes everything.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: The trial of Donald J. Trump is the first impeachment trial in a generation, and there are civics lessons here. The Constitution mandating Chief Justice John Roberts will preside with all senators serving as jurors. And other key calls are still wide open right now because when you understand the rules, you understand they can change any time.</p><p>I`m joined now by Judge Tim Lewis, appointed to the federal bench by President George H.W. Bush, and Former Senator Byron Dorgan from North Dakota. He served during the Clinton impeachment trial and voted not-guilty on both counts. A very special, and as I`ve emphasized, rare to have a Federal Appeals judge and a senator here together in this discussion.</p><p>Thanks to both of you.</p><p>TIM LEWIS, FORMER UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE: Thank you, Ari.</p><p>BYRON DORGAN, FORMER SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA: Thank you.</p><p>LEWIS: Happy to be here.</p><p>MELBER: Appreciate it.</p><p>Judge, let`s begin with you. What would define a fair trial of a President in the Senate?</p><p>LEWIS: That`s a - that`s a good question. There have been so few that we really kind of have to look at history and look forward, as you mentioned earlier, to the legacy that might be left to determine how best to perform, I think, as both senators and as the Chief Justice presiding.</p><p>I think that primarily we are looking for a decorum that rises above partisan politics to the extent possible in order to ensure that the American people get what they deserve, which is a fair look at whatever the charges are - that are brought by the Congress in the form of an impeachment might be. And we don`t know what those are at this point.</p><p>I think that in addition, the Chief Justice is going to have to adjust to a different environment. I`m not sure he`s exactly relishing presiding at an impeachment trial. As you know, the Supreme Court has no cameras. It`s a very different culture and a different environment. And so his presence and how he conducts business is going to also lend some definition to fairness and how things unfold.</p><p>MELBER: Let me - let me ask you about that. As a fellow judge, do you think this could become one of the most important things Chief Justice John Roberts ever does?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, as you know, the Supreme Court takes up the seminal issues in cases that we have to address as a society. So I`m not sure that I would go quite that far. But it certainly is a solemn responsibility. And it`s - as I said, it`s in a forum with which he does not have direct familiarity.</p><p>So I think that learning about the rules of the Senate, the rules of - their specific rules governing the Senate impeachment process, relying on the parliamentarian for some insight and advice, and really letting the senators take center stage as opposed to the Chief Justice to do what they must do, hoping that they will rise to the occasion. I mean, the whole world is watching. The whole country is watching. And it`s only charges against the President of the United States that could very well result in his removal. So--</p><p>MELBER: Let me bring in the Senator on that point. I mean, Senator Dorgan, whatever one`s views of the case, which by that time was I reached the Senate, the Clinton scandals had been well-debated in American life.</p><p>DORGAN: Right.</p><p>MELBER: Did you, did your colleagues, did you see anyone walk out of the Senate floor as the trial actually commenced and hit and felt the gravity - we just showed some of the clips - where they said, wait, this is a big one?</p><p>DORGAN: Yes. I mean, I think everybody understood this is a very sober moment. There is no joy in a United States Senate that convenes as a trial for a prosecution of impeachment resolution. It is a tough situation. Let me just tell you that as we began - there`s not much of a template for how you proceed. As we began, we - all 100 of us met in the old Senate chambers and had an off-the-record discussion about how do we do this. I mean, what`s the template by which we do this?</p><p>Some, for example, wanted to call witnesses into the chamber of the Senate. Bring Monica Lewinsky in, some of them said, so that she can be a witness and the - well, the fact is that was discarded, and ultimately we`ve got videotapes and they were able to present videotapes.</p><p>But - so we went to the Senate floor as a trial, as a - and we had to be sworn in separately as jurors. We had to sign an oath. And as you saw on the video, the Chief Justice was there in his black robe where there`s gold stripes on the arms. And we started. And it was very difficult. I mean, it went for - it started on January 7th 20 years ago and completed I think on February 12th--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Did that private room meeting that you`re referencing? Did it have, by the end, a consensus?</p><p>DORGAN: It did. And interestingly enough, the consensus was reached, as I recall, principally by Ted Kennedy and Phil Graham, very different people with very different--</p><p>MELBER: No kidding.</p><p>DORGAN: --political perspectives. And so we came out of that old Senate chamber with an understanding of how we should proceed. And not everything went smoothly, but by and large, it was a very sober time.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Dorgan, we pulled some of the then U.S. Senator Dorgan on the day of the acquittal. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORGAN: Every member of the Senate feels strongly about the President`s conduct, but I think that the Constitution worked today. The United States Senate decided not to nullify the last election in this country as a result of the charges that were brought against this President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The issue is maybe very different--</p><p>DORGAN: You know--</p><p>MELBER: --but eagle-eyed viewers will note your reference to not nullifying the past election is what--</p><p>DORGAN: You`re right--</p><p>MELBER: --what the President - the President`s lawyers have said this week about this effort.</p><p>DORGAN: But especially, not nullifying the election over personal behavior. That`s what this was about. This was about personal behavior, abhorrent as it was. But that`s vastly different than behavior in which a President is asking a foreign government to intervene and to involve themselves in an election here in this country. That, by the way, is criminal. So - I mean, there`s a lot of evidence that some really bad things have been happening and have happened. And I think this Senate will have to deal with those questions.</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>DORGAN: And they are not questions about personal behavior.</p><p>MELBER: Judge Lewis, there`s a question I have for you I`ve been waiting to ask all week since I had the opportunity to read the President`s lawyer Jay Sekulow early this week. He is taking the public position that it would be unfair, as a matter of general due process, to try to convict a President on anonymous testimony, people who can`t be confronted.</p><p>Now, we all know - I think most people, we all know the rules are different. There`s no Constitutional requirement of what merits due process. But what do you think about the substance of that argument? Do you think there`s fairness there? Would it concern you to remove any President if it was primarily on anonymous testimony?</p><p>MELBER: Look, the Constitution vests the authority to remove a President, exclusively in the United States Senate. And other than that, it does not spell out any specific guarantees of due process or some amorphous notion of fairness although we do hope that it is a fair process and procedure. It`s a political process by nature. That argument does not work, and it will not work. No.</p><p>The country really deserves a full airing of all of the charges that may be brought, whatever they might be and wherever they might lead. And we have reposed in our representatives the solemn responsibility to rise above politics to the extent possible and to do what they must do, what they`ve taken an oath to do, and uphold the Constitution.</p><p>You had an earlier clip, Ari, in which you played that segment from the Watergate hearings when Barbara Jordan spoke. And her words give me chills every time I hear them. My faith in the Constitution is complete. My faith in the Constitution is complete, too, but it is only as good and it will only rise to the level that we hope and expect to the extent that our representatives are able to do their job and to assume their oaths.</p><p>And so, no, I`m - it`s not an - it`s not an argument that is recognized in the Constitution. As you know, there are no rules of criminal procedure, civil procedure. This is a very unique proceeding. When--</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: --the Senate is convened for this proceeding, it is convened as a court--</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: --as a court of impeachment. And so they will determine--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>LEWIS: --what the rules are and how things unfold.</p><p>MELBER: Clarity, expertise, wisdom. I can`t say we get that all day every day from Washington, but we`ve certainly got it from both of you, Judge Lewis, Former Senator Dorgan. Thanks to both of you.</p><p>LEWIS: Thanks, Ari.</p><p>DORGAN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>MELBER: And coming up next, my interview with Ken Starr himself. We talk impeachment and whether a sitting President can be indicted. Later, what Elizabeth Warren is saying about her vision for 2020 and breaking up big tech. Then, when we get to the end of this hour, we`re going to have some of our very favorite moments from our \"Maverick\" series with Lee Daniels and Annie Lennox, and more of all of that. Plus, some lighter moments from \"The Beat\" coming up.</p><p>MELBER: Donald Trump`s Senate trial comes two decades after the trial of Bill Clinton. No one loomed larger over that trial than Independent Counsel Ken Starr who drove the investigation that led to impeachment, testified as a witness in the House hearings and even returned during the Senate trial to interview Monica Lewinsky again.</p><p>Starr ultimately faced criticism not only from Democrats but from many independent analysts and legal experts over his approach. He remains, still though, one of the few living figures who have run this kind of investigation that leads to a President`s Senate trial, which makes him very interesting to talk with.</p><p>And we got to do that this year, as Mueller was still writing his report. Tonight, we want to show you just a few quick highlights with some points that echo harshly for Donald Trump, as we talked witness tampering, Starr`s view on whether sitting presidents can be indicted. One of the issues that would soon hobble Trump, Congress`s power to impeach for obstruction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When I say obstruction, I mean, something that the Congress, about a president, might find to be obstructive and impeach over.</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER UNITED STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL &amp; FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Oh, yes, because Congress is not limited to these very technical elements, as you well know, with respect of what constitutes obstruction of justice.</p><p>MELBER: So those things you think Congress could impeach a president over if they found a pattern of obstruction?</p><p>STARR: Congress has clean area (ph) power under the Constitution, as I see it. It can say this is simply taken as a whole, the course of conduct constitutes an abuse of power.</p><p>MELBER: Abuse of power. What about discouraging witnesses from cooperating with law enforcement?</p><p>STARR: Once again, that could be an actual crime. Discouraging witnesses could, in fact, constitute intimidation of witnesses. For impeachment, again, Ari, I want to draw a line--</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>STARR: --between what Congress could say this is conduct that we don`t accept as opposed to here`s a criminal offense. It doesn`t, in my judgment, need to rise to the level of a technical crime under obstruction of justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: We concluded that perjury and obstruction of justice, like bribery, may constitute grounds for an impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Are you in a position now where people will question whether you`re applying a different standard to this President who happens to be in your party and the President you investigated who happened to be in the other party?</p><p>STARR: No, because it began with actual perjury, and we believe intimidation of witnesses in a judicial proceeding. So that`s another aspect of this. What the President had to face - what President Clinton had to face was a civil action, a civil rights action, and he had to then be honest. He could settle the case, which he should have done, or then he had to conduct himself lawfully, and he did not. And I don`t think anyone seriously disputes that he not only committed perjury, he encouraged others to lie.</p><p>And then here was the crescendo, what we reached, and this was with the complete agreement of the legendary at the time, Sam Dash, now departed, who was in the Watergate episode as a special counsel to Senator Sam Ervin. And all of this led up to abuse of power.</p><p>One of the messages as you`ll get there is impeachment is hell. We lived through that as a country 20 years ago. And so I think it requires--</p><p>MELBER: You`re saying you put us through hell.</p><p>STARR: I`m saying the House of Representatives took the evidence and said, we have a duty to do what we feel like what--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Well you - if that`s what you had them do. I mean, you wrote a report for them to impeach.</p><p>STARR: I didn`t - I gave them that - Ari, this is great. Ari, I--</p><p>MELBER: This is great?</p><p>STARR: It is.</p><p>MELBER: Ken Starr on live TV saying that you didn`t give them information to lead to impeachment?</p><p>STARR: No. You - you had a very different characterization to the question. So roll it back. Roll the transcript back. And now I will answer the question--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: I got to tell you. I feel like I`m talking to a lawyer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: Go ahead, sir.</p><p>STARR: Well, so am I. So what the statute - and this is one of the defects of the statute, and it`s no longer a defect that Bob Mueller has to live with, is that the statute set the bar very low for providing information that may constitute grounds for impeachment. That`s what the Congress required the Independent Counsel to do. So the report that went up was precisely that, which Congress in 1978 said that`s what we want.</p><p>Ari, the good news is, for the country, we don`t have that regime anymore.</p><p>MELBER: You`re saying - and I`m characterizing - but you`re saying the good news is we`ll never have another Ken Starr investigation?</p><p>STARR: We will have no - well, you could also ask Judge Walsh and so forth. So I--</p><p>MELBER: Which I`m asking you.</p><p>STARR: I`d prefer that you not personalize it and make it more structural because the statute created - well, there were about 20 independent counsels over the course of that 21 years.</p><p>MELBER: But yours was the one at your tenure that led to that impeachment that you are calling hell, that you`re right. Obviously, the underlying law was strong, as I mentioned earlier. So it put that information, but you wrote that report.</p><p>Let`s also get to something very interesting that you know is hot today. You solicited an opinion for your investigation that argued a sitting president could be indicted. Did you agree with that view then?</p><p>STARR: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Now, when we come back in 30 seconds, my interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>MELBER: Welcome back to our holiday special right here on \"The Beat.\" Trump`s impeachment trial is moving forward in the Senate. And some Democratic Presidential candidates will be taking their ideas out to the American public at the same time. That includes a push to address, what some call, the monopoly power of those big tech companies like Amazon or Facebook. Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren has been, of course, leading that fight. That`s something we spoke about in our interview on the day that she announced her plan to break up big tech this year. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need real competition in this field. And there`s a problem.</p><p>So Amazon, Google, they own a platform, which is pretty cool, right, where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say, to Amazon in order to sell their goods. And they don`t just compete straight up.</p><p>They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide, oh, I`m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect. It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team.</p><p>My view is you can do, one, be an umpire, or the other, my view is you can be one, be the umpire or, two, own a team. But you don`t get up to do both at the same time.</p><p>MELBER: Right. And you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You dropped this plan today. This is your first big TV interview about it.</p><p>Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Warren rolling out one of her big policy plans, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen to-date from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s big and it`s bold, and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Could she really do it?</p><p>WARREN: You bet.</p><p>MELBER: What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN: The answer is yes. But you know, let`s be really clear about this. If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at 63 choices and get the one that`s going to be there in 48 hours, you can still do that as a consumer. This preserves the platform. If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it.</p><p>What this is about is about competition. It`s about all those little businesses and startup businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon or on Google and toward an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google, if they like the money they see that you`re making because they get all the information, they decide to go into competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s go to the way the Treasury Department is run because you look at it right now - I`ll draw your attention to a very simple illustration--</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: --under Donald Trump. We could put up on the screen. You have, in the red zone there, Goldman Sachs--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: --as part of Treasury Department leadership. If you go back, during the Obama era, we checked, and as you know, we had Goldman Sachs former executives running Treasury then. Go back to Bush, also Goldman Sachs. Go back to Bill Clinton, also Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In a Warren administration, would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN: Nope.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Oh - that`s a--</p><p>MELBER: That`s a litmus test.</p><p>WARREN: Absolutely. But let me tell you why. The problem we`ve got right now is a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington that causes everybody to be on guess for - wait a minute. The next time this Treasury Secretary puts forward a proposal, is it because it really helps the economy, helps the American consumer, helps the American homeowner, or is it because it helps their former and possibly future employer?</p><p>Let`s just do for one second the Gary Cohn example, another Goldman Sachs. Do you remember?</p><p>MELBER: (inaudible).</p><p>WARREN: That`s exactly right. So Trump appoints Gary Cohn. He leaves Goldman Sachs. And Gary Cohn is going to have exactly one job, and that is to ramrod through a rewrite of the tax laws that will profoundly affect Goldman Sachs.</p><p>So what does Goldman Sachs do as Gary walks out the door? They hand him nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. It`s a gift. They don`t have to. It`s--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Is it legal bribery?</p><p>WARREN: I think - I think of it as a pre-bribe.</p><p>MELBER: Pre-bribe.</p><p>WARREN: Yes. So Gary then goes out and guess what he does. He writes a tax law--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: --and manages to help ramrod it through, that benefits Goldman Sachs to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars in the first go-round.</p><p>MELBER: And what you`re saying--</p><p>WARREN: --and then it`s the gift that keeps on--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: What you`re saying makes sense, and we have such--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: --ripe targets. I think people could understand what you`re pointing to. But what does it mean for the Democratic Party if this was also how Obama and Clinton ran the Treasury. Would you be a fundamental break with that, I guess, is the question.</p><p>WARREN: The problem - I have written the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate because we have a fundamental problem in Washington. And understand, it`s a problem that pre-dates Trump by decades.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: Trump may be the most extreme example now, the pre-bribes of Gary Cohn, for example. But we have a long standing problem, and that`s the influence of money on decision-making in Washington. So this bill has lots of pieces to it, including closing the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington, ending lobbying, as we know it, putting a real ethics cop on \"The Beat\" saying that the heads of these agencies cannot be trading in stocks--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: --on individual stocks.</p><p>MELBER: So, as a political matter, are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money.</p><p>WARREN: Maybe. But this isn`t about the money. This is about how it is we`re going to make this country work again, not just for the rich and the powerful, how are we going to make it work for everyone.</p><p>MELBER: Everyone has been talking about the rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got. When you look at that, does that reflect what you`re saying--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: --and Washington works well for the connected and the affluent and nobody else?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. It`s two justice systems. Look at the words carved above the United States Supreme Court. \"Equal justice under law.\" But look at the reality. People who got buckets of money and are well connected kept traded with kid gloves.</p><p>MELBER: So do you think--</p><p>WARREN: Everybody else doesn`t.</p><p>MELBER: Do you think when you look at that statistically that a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence?</p><p>WARREN: Oh. We know the data on this. Of course, the sentence would have been different. In fact, study after study after study shows that for the exact same crimes, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be prosecuted, to be arrested and wrongfully convicted and to receive harsher sentences. Race matters in our criminal justice system, and it is not a system of equal justice under law.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve got a couple of one-word associations. If you could do it in a word. Some of them relate to your bill.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: Amazon.</p><p>WARREN: Can I have two words?</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Google.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful. And that`s really the point of the too-bigs. It`s they`ve got too much power. And they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors, and ultimately to change the consumer experience. We`ve got to change that.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite song to work out to?</p><p>WARREN: Anything from Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Patsy Cline. Favorite--</p><p>WARREN: I love Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite album or artist when you were growing up.</p><p>WARREN: Any of \"The Beatles.\"</p><p>MELBER: \"Beatles.\"</p><p>WARREN: Probably - probably \"The White Album.\"</p><p>MELBER: Now, I`ve got to know your favorite Beatle.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, no, that`s not fair.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARREN: It`s like asking your favorite child.</p><p>MELBER: I would guess - what do I know? I don`t know you that well. I would guess Lennon. George Harrison? Boom.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Your dream running mate throughout history, living or dead, if you could pick a person that would run with you.</p><p>WARREN: Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>MELBER: A Republican?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Because he took on the trusts?</p><p>WARREN: Because he was brave. And he took on the trusts. And he didn`t care how many people were going to be mad about it. And he did it. This is what`s amazing, for the right reasons. It wasn`t just that they were big. It wasn`t just that they were dominating an economy. It wasn`t just that they were putting farmers out of business and competitors out of business and small companies out of business. It was that they had too much political power. And it was the very fact of that political power that caused Teddy Roosevelt to say, I`m going to be a trust-buster. Man, I`d like to have that guy at my side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: There is a beloved actress who`s been talking about you, Annette Bening.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s take a look. I think we have this for you. Annette Bening says she knows she looks like Elizabeth Warren--</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: --thank you very much. Now--</p><p>WARREN: Wow! I`m flattened.</p><p>MELBER: Does she look like you or do you look like her?</p><p>WARREN: Either way. I`m totally happy with this comparison.</p><p>MELBER: You like this?</p><p>WARREN: Yes, I do.</p><p>MELBER: Would you be comfortable - if and when there`s a Warren administration and then there`s a Warren movie, would you be comfortable with her playing you?</p><p>WARREN: I`m all in.</p><p>MELBER: You`re ready for that?</p><p>WARREN: I`m ready.</p><p>MELBER: We have to ask before we let you go, how Bailey is doing. This dog is beloved on your campaign.</p><p>WARREN: This dog is the best. Between the Bailey cam and the opportunity to meet people, and voters and people have been bringing him little treats. So Bailey is filling out now for a 10-month-old dog.</p><p>MELBER: And he has his own greeting line as well as you.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, man! He does a photo line like you wouldn`t believe. And I want to be really clear about this, Ari. It is not a competition.</p><p>MELBER: No.</p><p>WARREN: I say this because I definitely do not want to be in competition with a 10-month-old Golden Retriever.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve seen him. I`m a dog person myself. I`m sure he could get a lot of individual donors as well if he goes in that direction.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Warren, coming here on the day of your big tech announcement, we really appreciate it. Hope you come back on \"The Beat.\"</p><p>WARREN: Good.</p><p>MELBER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: We`re going to show you a lot more ahead on this holiday special of \"The Beat,\" including my conversation with Oscar-winning Director Lee Daniels, part of many of our \"Mavericks\" highlights.</p><p>MELBER: Welcome back to our holiday special. Over this whole year, some \"Beat\" viewers come up to me and say, what is the deal with all the music stuff? Some others of you have said, well, thank you for adding some culture into the news. And honestly, culture already is in our life and in our politics.</p><p>The only question in the newsroom is whether we face it or just ignore it. Artists often form our first view of things, whether it`s Bruce Springsteen or Bob Dylan making us think about America or Joni Mitchell and Muhammad Ali making us think about our foreign policy.</p><p>This year, I think we had our mind expanded by several artists on \"The Beat.\" Take Lee Daniels, award-winning Director of \"Precious,\" \"The Butler,\" \"Monster`s Ball,\" and the hit show, \"Empire.\" He joined me for our \"Maverick\" series, discussing racism in life and Hollywood, why Donald Trump once asked him to direct a movie, and then this exchange that many of you have written in about.</p><p>Daniels opening up about the emotional moment when Halle Berry won an Oscar for a leading role in his film, \"Monster`s Ball,\" in 2002.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Where were you when Halle Berry was the first black woman to win an Oscar for a lead role in that movie?</p><p>LEE DANIELS, AMERICAN FILM WRITER, DIRECTOR &amp; PRODUCER: I was in a hotel. You`ve clearly done your homework. Have you?</p><p>MELBER: I do some homework. All right. There you go.</p><p>DANIELS: Yes. I was in a hotel, inebriated.</p><p>MELBER: Not expecting to win then? Or inebriated regardless?</p><p>DANIELS: Not expecting to win at all. Invited, but not - I didn`t intend on - didn`t feel like I deserved to be there.</p><p>MELBER: Why not? You were part of the movie.</p><p>DANIELS: Oh, no. Because when Hollywood tells you you do not deserve it, you sort of believe that.</p><p>MELBER: What hotel?</p><p>DANIELS: The Chateau Marmont.</p><p>MELBER: Naturally. A little on the nose, Lee.</p><p>DANIELS: Oh, yes? Sort of. I didn`t think I was deserved being at the table. So I didn`t - I didn`t go there.</p><p>MELBER: So that`s something people who think of you as this successful culture-creating star, frankly, might be surprised that even at that point in your career, even on Oscar night, you weren`t in the room - as you put it, inebriated in a hotel, and then this happens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the Oscar goes to Halle Berry in \"Monster`s Ball.\"</p><p>HALLE BERRY, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I want to thank Lee Daniels, our producer. Thank you for giving me this chance, for believing that I could do it, and now, tonight, I have this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIELS: That`s nice. I hadn`t seen that in forever. I hadn`t - think I saw it since that time and since the - since the Chateau Marmont.</p><p>MELBER: This is the first time you`re seeing it since that night. How does it look now?</p><p>DANIELS: It looks great. It makes me feel like I was just naive and stupid for not going. Yes.</p><p>MELBER: What brings the tears?</p><p>DANIELS: It`s a hard fight, a really hard fight. And she deserved it. Yes, she deserved it. It was a - that`s the first time I`ve seen that.</p><p>MELBER: She deserved it, but you didn`t think--</p><p>DANIELS: I deserved it? No, I didn`t think I deserved it. Yes, I was just doing another day - another day. I`m trying to think about what my next gig is at, where did my next gig is coming from and how I could change the world with the next piece of work that I could do. Something that was unexpected. So, she`s there. I`m in the bed with a crack pipe and thinking, OK, so what`s next for me? What - how do I - how do I change the world with the next piece of work that I want to create.</p><p>MELBER: How do you feel remembering that she thought you did deserve it and she thanks you from that stage?</p><p>DANIELS: See, you just don`t have time to take it in. You don`t have time. Life is so short that you just, ah, OK, thank you. You know? And you don`t really stop and take it in. And this time, I took it in. That`s why I became emotional. You`ll never see me cry on television again. That`s for sure.</p><p>MELBER: Yes?</p><p>DANIELS: Mm-mm (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Mm-mm (ph). I don`t think we have since. Our thanks to Lee Daniels for that candid conversation. We`re also thankful to a legendary singer I know you know about, Annie Lennox. She took us on an unusual tour of an art exhibit, tracing her work and life at MASS MoCA museum. This is also part of our \"Mavericks\" interviews. And it touched on how she pushed boundaries on gender identity and feminism back in 1983 when she was out wearing men`s clothing and touring worldwide with eurhythmics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When you were coming up in eurhythmics, the reaction around the world was, wow, how can she dress like that, or does that mean she`s gay, or what does that say about gender? And you said - you`ve said at the time, you weren`t trying to be a gender-bender. So what were you trying?</p><p>ANNIE LENNOX, SINGER-SONGWRITER: I wanted to be a powerful performer. And I wanted to resonate to people in a certain way. And I definitely, by the time Dave and I formed eurhythmics, I definitely had the sense of who I was and what I wanted to do.</p><p>And it was in partnership with Dave, who`s a man, and the sense of being equals. We were almost like twins on the stage. Like, we were each other`s muse, if you`d like. That is powerful wear a man`s - I mean, I didn`t always wear a man`s suit. I wore all kinds of costumes. I mean, that was one way to perform that made people think and had a very, very strong, powerful image, if you like. If I broke rules, they were very restrictive.</p><p>MELBER: Many people remember you wearing this \"HIV POSITIVE\" shirt.</p><p>LENNOX: I hope people remember me. And I hope that that message did spread. As an advocate for HIV and AIDS, I wore that T-shirt or T-shirts like that with the messaging on the front, and at the back, it would say, fighting HIV and AIDS. I`m a mother. So I think it`s the fact that I`m a woman and a mother and have been a young girl. And I identify with women everywhere.</p><p>For me, my interpretation of feminism goes right around the globe because beyond the unseen boundaries of our western bubble lie the biggest challenges for girls and women around the globe that there, you know, those are the places where we need feminism, female empowerment more than anywhere else. There`s just such a huge gap that needs to be addressed. We need to understand feminism on a global basis.</p><p>I come from a working class background in Scotland. I thought I understood what poverty was. There was poverty around. When I went to visit these countries, when I saw what was happening, you see children in rags, you see children that cannot go to school, you see children that cannot eat. And that`s a population level because of poverty. You - you don`t - you realize that, oh, my God, I didn`t know what poverty meant. When you understand the scale of it, it is very, very life-changing.</p><p>We all have things, baggage. We`ve all got experiences. We`ve all got memories. A lot of them we need to let go off as well. And we go through those phases. I`m in this kind of older phase of my life where I`m reflecting a lot back. A lot of things are memory for me. I`ve kind of re- created them in this dream-scape which is (inaudible) let you go.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: That was really neat for us to spend some time there. And of course, it was her vision that propelled her to the top of the charts. We checked. They sold over 80 million records worldwide and worked on the activism you saw there.</p><p>The `80s were also a time of artistic inspiration and revolution right here in New York City, the foundation for shifts across the culture. That`s something we explored in my interview with two moguls from Def Jam Records, who helped make hip-hop mainstream, Kevin Liles and Lyor Cohen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN LILES, AMERICAN RECORD EXECUTIVE &amp; CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, 300 ENTERTAINMENT: I believe rap music took on something from early rock-and- roll that said there`s a lot that we have to say. Remember, rap music was introduced on a corner and then maybe one hour every Friday night for a show.</p><p>LYOR COHEN, AMERICAN MUSIC EXECUTIVE: What was happening here in New York in the early `80s is fashion, art and rap music was bumping, colliding together. And the spirit of it was underpinned by affordable housing.</p><p>So the whole SoHo, where we are right now, was full of artists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Imagine that, Downtown New York being affordable. What he was talking about there was also of course including visual artists. And we heard about that in our series this year as well from producer Swizz Beatz. He`s working with artists like Kehinde Wiley to advance diversity in the often closed art world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SWIZZ BEATZ, AMERICAN DJ, RECORD PRODUCER, ART COLLECTOR &amp; ENTREPRENEUR: It`s something different to say I have Kehinde Wiley, and matter of fact, let me see if he`s around for dinner tonight. Right?</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>BEATZ: It`s very important for us, as a culture, to own the culture or pieces of the culture and change that whole concept of making it for other people to own, and we don`t have a trace of it left around where we can pull from, which is the reason why we collect and the decollection so heavy. We collect like we`re building a museum because we wanted to save most of these pieces, so the next generation and the youth can have something to pull from or go back to - of the history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: It`s living history. And those are just some of the topics we got to tackle on \"Mavericks.\" I want to share with you, if you want to see more of those, there`s longer in-depth interviews, and they`re all posted at msnbc.com/mavericks. You can check them out now. We`re not done tonight though. Coming up, some of our favorite funny moments all across this year on \"The Beat.\" It`s a highlight reel you don`t want to miss.</p><p>MELBER: How do you take stock of your year? Do you focus on the big stuff, the most intense memories, or maybe the goofy times that reminded you how much we`re all just people trying to make our way in this world? Well, around here, honestly, we obviously work on a television show. So many of our moments have been recorded for better or worse. And we`ve gathered them together to share with you. And a warning to viewers, brace yourself for some musical references, dad jokes and, yes, even - awkward silences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sit down because here it comes. \"The Beat with Ari Melber\" starts right now. Good evening, Ari.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s it, buddy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really expected a rap lyric for this one, Ari.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you really majority leader, if you`re not running this like (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To quote Jay-Z, when the gimmies (ph) in the system, ain`t no telling, will he love him or he diss (ph) him?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To quote Killer Mike--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A line from Drake--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Barr worked it? I think Barr flipped it and reversed it.</p><p>MELBER: Do you have any Killer Mike quotes for us, Bill?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do I - do I not--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A wise man once said, \"Nothing at all.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me get on my back, Joe, and say, lean back and welcome David Brooks (ph) to the party.</p><p>MELBER: It`s getting hot in here. Maybe not you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, I`m cold.</p><p>MELBER: Are you dropping precedence in your first answer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did. I`m sorry about that.</p><p>MELBER: It`s just got - just amazing.</p><p>You guys realize this is weird, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is super weird.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER (voice-over): The awkward silences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s reflect on that.</p><p>I did want to let this moment--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sit.</p><p>MELBER: --sit.</p><p>I don`t know what can you say.</p><p>That`s how they know about the Martians who landed here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s just (ph) same time.</p><p>MELBER: Actually, I`m making a joke.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to end with my bad holiday joke--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Are you saying the cattle industry had beef with Oprah?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: This is a holiday where you say, look, let my full report go.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just come on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is - this is--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait. I quit. No. Wait. Wait.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is ending toxic masculinity right here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: It all happened here. Thanks for being a part of it. We won`t soon forget it.</p><p>MELBER: Now, as far as we`re concerned around here, 2019 was not a normal year, and it wasn`t supposed to be because you can`t look at what`s been happening and act like it`s normal. So we`ve been doing our part night- after-night. We want to say thank you to the viewers for watching and supporting the journalism and what we do on \"The Beat.\" We want to wish everyone, of course, a very happy new year.</p><p>And I want to thank our team because sometimes I get people coming up to me saying, and they say, wow, how`d you find this or that was so clear the way you explained and reported that. And the answer is, well, thank you, but it is a huge, huge team effort from everyone here in our headquarters at MSNBC and around the building and around the world. We want to say thank you to those who put this all together.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Americans have been, of course, now leaning into the holidays, stepping back from a year where Donald Trump`s actions certainly caught up with him, facing a December impeachment, an existential crisis for the Trump Presidency after a news year consumed by his mistakes and scandals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I`m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.</p><p>MELBER: They are under fire from all sides for this whistleblower complaint.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: They`d start a major investigation into the Bidens.</p><p>MELBER: Donald Trump busted for making good on his infamous claim he would take foreign help in 2020.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeachment is imperative.</p><p>MELBER: --that the President committed crimes in office.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you say impeach?</p><p>MELBER: So that is a thing.</p><p>The case for bribery is straightforward. And everyone knows bribery is impeachable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that`s why we held up the money. We do that all the time with foreign policy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But to be clear, you just described is a quid pro quo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tell me what rule, law or statute has been violated by the President--</p><p>MELBER: Do you want to point to statutes? That`s not required, but it is--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, yes, but tell me about the--</p><p>MELBER: Hold on. And then I`ll you respond, sir. It is unlawful to solicit or receive any foreign help, which includes things of value.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think what it - I think, for a citizen, it set off some alarms.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because that`s obviously shady?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it`s pretty damning evidence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Damning slam dunk evidence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An incredibly damning admission that you can`t trust the President not to commit crimes.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery.</p><p>PELOSI: That`s it. It`s perfectly wrong. It`s bribery.</p><p>MELBER: A week unlike any other in the Trump era. Nine different Trump administration insiders who joined 12 other witnesses who`ve now provided over 30 hours of testimony in the--</p><p>GORDON SONDLAND, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION: Was there a quid pro quo? The answer is yes.</p><p>MELBER (voice-over): Here is the most important shift in all the testimony to-date. Sondland moves over, suddenly saying, yes, this was bribery.</p><p>FIONA HILL, FORMER TOP RUSSIA EXPERT AT U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: He was being involved in a domestic political errand. And we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged.</p><p>SONDLAND: Everyone was in the loop.</p><p>MELBER: His personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is in Ukraine today, of all places. He says he`s meeting with prosecutors, which are of course also potential witnesses.</p><p>To paraphrase Biggie Smalls, he is going going back back to Kyiv Kyiv.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a crime spree in progress. And that gives us an urgency to act.</p><p>MELBER: Rudy Giuliani is pulling off--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Getting Donald Trump impeached.</p><p>The House will do what many thought it was on its way to do, impeach President Trump, starting now.</p><p>PELOSI: I`m asking our Chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment.</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): This lawless President has taken advantage of the public trust.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): --committing high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>MELBER: You absolutely have a Constitution that provides for a very quick remedy to that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`ve got President Trump who`s basically out-Nixoning Nixon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An extraordinary breach of the powers of the Presidency.</p><p>MELBER: It is a vote that actually changes everything.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: The trial of Donald J. Trump is the first impeachment trial in a generation, and there are civics lessons here. The Constitution mandating Chief Justice John Roberts will preside with all senators serving as jurors. And other key calls are still wide open right now because when you understand the rules, you understand they can change any time.</p><p>I`m joined now by Judge Tim Lewis, appointed to the federal bench by President George H.W. Bush, and Former Senator Byron Dorgan from North Dakota. He served during the Clinton impeachment trial and voted not-guilty on both counts. A very special, and as I`ve emphasized, rare to have a Federal Appeals judge and a senator here together in this discussion.</p><p>Thanks to both of you.</p><p>TIM LEWIS, FORMER UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE: Thank you, Ari.</p><p>BYRON DORGAN, FORMER SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA: Thank you.</p><p>LEWIS: Happy to be here.</p><p>MELBER: Appreciate it.</p><p>Judge, let`s begin with you. What would define a fair trial of a President in the Senate?</p><p>LEWIS: That`s a - that`s a good question. There have been so few that we really kind of have to look at history and look forward, as you mentioned earlier, to the legacy that might be left to determine how best to perform, I think, as both senators and as the Chief Justice presiding.</p><p>I think that primarily we are looking for a decorum that rises above partisan politics to the extent possible in order to ensure that the American people get what they deserve, which is a fair look at whatever the charges are - that are brought by the Congress in the form of an impeachment might be. And we don`t know what those are at this point.</p><p>I think that in addition, the Chief Justice is going to have to adjust to a different environment. I`m not sure he`s exactly relishing presiding at an impeachment trial. As you know, the Supreme Court has no cameras. It`s a very different culture and a different environment. And so his presence and how he conducts business is going to also lend some definition to fairness and how things unfold.</p><p>MELBER: Let me - let me ask you about that. As a fellow judge, do you think this could become one of the most important things Chief Justice John Roberts ever does?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, as you know, the Supreme Court takes up the seminal issues in cases that we have to address as a society. So I`m not sure that I would go quite that far. But it certainly is a solemn responsibility. And it`s - as I said, it`s in a forum with which he does not have direct familiarity.</p><p>So I think that learning about the rules of the Senate, the rules of - their specific rules governing the Senate impeachment process, relying on the parliamentarian for some insight and advice, and really letting the senators take center stage as opposed to the Chief Justice to do what they must do, hoping that they will rise to the occasion. I mean, the whole world is watching. The whole country is watching. And it`s only charges against the President of the United States that could very well result in his removal. So--</p><p>MELBER: Let me bring in the Senator on that point. I mean, Senator Dorgan, whatever one`s views of the case, which by that time was I reached the Senate, the Clinton scandals had been well-debated in American life.</p><p>DORGAN: Right.</p><p>MELBER: Did you, did your colleagues, did you see anyone walk out of the Senate floor as the trial actually commenced and hit and felt the gravity - we just showed some of the clips - where they said, wait, this is a big one?</p><p>DORGAN: Yes. I mean, I think everybody understood this is a very sober moment. There is no joy in a United States Senate that convenes as a trial for a prosecution of impeachment resolution. It is a tough situation. Let me just tell you that as we began - there`s not much of a template for how you proceed. As we began, we - all 100 of us met in the old Senate chambers and had an off-the-record discussion about how do we do this. I mean, what`s the template by which we do this?</p><p>Some, for example, wanted to call witnesses into the chamber of the Senate. Bring Monica Lewinsky in, some of them said, so that she can be a witness and the - well, the fact is that was discarded, and ultimately we`ve got videotapes and they were able to present videotapes.</p><p>But - so we went to the Senate floor as a trial, as a - and we had to be sworn in separately as jurors. We had to sign an oath. And as you saw on the video, the Chief Justice was there in his black robe where there`s gold stripes on the arms. And we started. And it was very difficult. I mean, it went for - it started on January 7th 20 years ago and completed I think on February 12th--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Did that private room meeting that you`re referencing? Did it have, by the end, a consensus?</p><p>DORGAN: It did. And interestingly enough, the consensus was reached, as I recall, principally by Ted Kennedy and Phil Graham, very different people with very different--</p><p>MELBER: No kidding.</p><p>DORGAN: --political perspectives. And so we came out of that old Senate chamber with an understanding of how we should proceed. And not everything went smoothly, but by and large, it was a very sober time.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Dorgan, we pulled some of the then U.S. Senator Dorgan on the day of the acquittal. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DORGAN: Every member of the Senate feels strongly about the President`s conduct, but I think that the Constitution worked today. The United States Senate decided not to nullify the last election in this country as a result of the charges that were brought against this President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The issue is maybe very different--</p><p>DORGAN: You know--</p><p>MELBER: --but eagle-eyed viewers will note your reference to not nullifying the past election is what--</p><p>DORGAN: You`re right--</p><p>MELBER: --what the President - the President`s lawyers have said this week about this effort.</p><p>DORGAN: But especially, not nullifying the election over personal behavior. That`s what this was about. This was about personal behavior, abhorrent as it was. But that`s vastly different than behavior in which a President is asking a foreign government to intervene and to involve themselves in an election here in this country. That, by the way, is criminal. So - I mean, there`s a lot of evidence that some really bad things have been happening and have happened. And I think this Senate will have to deal with those questions.</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>DORGAN: And they are not questions about personal behavior.</p><p>MELBER: Judge Lewis, there`s a question I have for you I`ve been waiting to ask all week since I had the opportunity to read the President`s lawyer Jay Sekulow early this week. He is taking the public position that it would be unfair, as a matter of general due process, to try to convict a President on anonymous testimony, people who can`t be confronted.</p><p>Now, we all know - I think most people, we all know the rules are different. There`s no Constitutional requirement of what merits due process. But what do you think about the substance of that argument? Do you think there`s fairness there? Would it concern you to remove any President if it was primarily on anonymous testimony?</p><p>MELBER: Look, the Constitution vests the authority to remove a President, exclusively in the United States Senate. And other than that, it does not spell out any specific guarantees of due process or some amorphous notion of fairness although we do hope that it is a fair process and procedure. It`s a political process by nature. That argument does not work, and it will not work. No.</p><p>The country really deserves a full airing of all of the charges that may be brought, whatever they might be and wherever they might lead. And we have reposed in our representatives the solemn responsibility to rise above politics to the extent possible and to do what they must do, what they`ve taken an oath to do, and uphold the Constitution.</p><p>You had an earlier clip, Ari, in which you played that segment from the Watergate hearings when Barbara Jordan spoke. And her words give me chills every time I hear them. My faith in the Constitution is complete. My faith in the Constitution is complete, too, but it is only as good and it will only rise to the level that we hope and expect to the extent that our representatives are able to do their job and to assume their oaths.</p><p>And so, no, I`m - it`s not an - it`s not an argument that is recognized in the Constitution. As you know, there are no rules of criminal procedure, civil procedure. This is a very unique proceeding. When--</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: --the Senate is convened for this proceeding, it is convened as a court--</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>LEWIS: --as a court of impeachment. And so they will determine--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>LEWIS: --what the rules are and how things unfold.</p><p>MELBER: Clarity, expertise, wisdom. I can`t say we get that all day every day from Washington, but we`ve certainly got it from both of you, Judge Lewis, Former Senator Dorgan. Thanks to both of you.</p><p>LEWIS: Thanks, Ari.</p><p>DORGAN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>MELBER: And coming up next, my interview with Ken Starr himself. We talk impeachment and whether a sitting President can be indicted. Later, what Elizabeth Warren is saying about her vision for 2020 and breaking up big tech. Then, when we get to the end of this hour, we`re going to have some of our very favorite moments from our \"Maverick\" series with Lee Daniels and Annie Lennox, and more of all of that. Plus, some lighter moments from \"The Beat\" coming up.</p><p>MELBER: Donald Trump`s Senate trial comes two decades after the trial of Bill Clinton. No one loomed larger over that trial than Independent Counsel Ken Starr who drove the investigation that led to impeachment, testified as a witness in the House hearings and even returned during the Senate trial to interview Monica Lewinsky again.</p><p>Starr ultimately faced criticism not only from Democrats but from many independent analysts and legal experts over his approach. He remains, still though, one of the few living figures who have run this kind of investigation that leads to a President`s Senate trial, which makes him very interesting to talk with.</p><p>And we got to do that this year, as Mueller was still writing his report. Tonight, we want to show you just a few quick highlights with some points that echo harshly for Donald Trump, as we talked witness tampering, Starr`s view on whether sitting presidents can be indicted. One of the issues that would soon hobble Trump, Congress`s power to impeach for obstruction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When I say obstruction, I mean, something that the Congress, about a president, might find to be obstructive and impeach over.</p><p>KEN STARR, FORMER UNITED STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL &amp; FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Oh, yes, because Congress is not limited to these very technical elements, as you well know, with respect of what constitutes obstruction of justice.</p><p>MELBER: So those things you think Congress could impeach a president over if they found a pattern of obstruction?</p><p>STARR: Congress has clean area (ph) power under the Constitution, as I see it. It can say this is simply taken as a whole, the course of conduct constitutes an abuse of power.</p><p>MELBER: Abuse of power. What about discouraging witnesses from cooperating with law enforcement?</p><p>STARR: Once again, that could be an actual crime. Discouraging witnesses could, in fact, constitute intimidation of witnesses. For impeachment, again, Ari, I want to draw a line--</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>STARR: --between what Congress could say this is conduct that we don`t accept as opposed to here`s a criminal offense. It doesn`t, in my judgment, need to rise to the level of a technical crime under obstruction of justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: We concluded that perjury and obstruction of justice, like bribery, may constitute grounds for an impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Are you in a position now where people will question whether you`re applying a different standard to this President who happens to be in your party and the President you investigated who happened to be in the other party?</p><p>STARR: No, because it began with actual perjury, and we believe intimidation of witnesses in a judicial proceeding. So that`s another aspect of this. What the President had to face - what President Clinton had to face was a civil action, a civil rights action, and he had to then be honest. He could settle the case, which he should have done, or then he had to conduct himself lawfully, and he did not. And I don`t think anyone seriously disputes that he not only committed perjury, he encouraged others to lie.</p><p>And then here was the crescendo, what we reached, and this was with the complete agreement of the legendary at the time, Sam Dash, now departed, who was in the Watergate episode as a special counsel to Senator Sam Ervin. And all of this led up to abuse of power.</p><p>One of the messages as you`ll get there is impeachment is hell. We lived through that as a country 20 years ago. And so I think it requires--</p><p>MELBER: You`re saying you put us through hell.</p><p>STARR: I`m saying the House of Representatives took the evidence and said, we have a duty to do what we feel like what--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Well you - if that`s what you had them do. I mean, you wrote a report for them to impeach.</p><p>STARR: I didn`t - I gave them that - Ari, this is great. Ari, I--</p><p>MELBER: This is great?</p><p>STARR: It is.</p><p>MELBER: Ken Starr on live TV saying that you didn`t give them information to lead to impeachment?</p><p>STARR: No. You - you had a very different characterization to the question. So roll it back. Roll the transcript back. And now I will answer the question--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: I got to tell you. I feel like I`m talking to a lawyer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: Go ahead, sir.</p><p>STARR: Well, so am I. So what the statute - and this is one of the defects of the statute, and it`s no longer a defect that Bob Mueller has to live with, is that the statute set the bar very low for providing information that may constitute grounds for impeachment. That`s what the Congress required the Independent Counsel to do. So the report that went up was precisely that, which Congress in 1978 said that`s what we want.</p><p>Ari, the good news is, for the country, we don`t have that regime anymore.</p><p>MELBER: You`re saying - and I`m characterizing - but you`re saying the good news is we`ll never have another Ken Starr investigation?</p><p>STARR: We will have no - well, you could also ask Judge Walsh and so forth. So I--</p><p>MELBER: Which I`m asking you.</p><p>STARR: I`d prefer that you not personalize it and make it more structural because the statute created - well, there were about 20 independent counsels over the course of that 21 years.</p><p>MELBER: But yours was the one at your tenure that led to that impeachment that you are calling hell, that you`re right. Obviously, the underlying law was strong, as I mentioned earlier. So it put that information, but you wrote that report.</p><p>Let`s also get to something very interesting that you know is hot today. You solicited an opinion for your investigation that argued a sitting president could be indicted. Did you agree with that view then?</p><p>STARR: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Now, when we come back in 30 seconds, my interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>MELBER: Welcome back to our holiday special right here on \"The Beat.\" Trump`s impeachment trial is moving forward in the Senate. And some Democratic Presidential candidates will be taking their ideas out to the American public at the same time. That includes a push to address, what some call, the monopoly power of those big tech companies like Amazon or Facebook. Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren has been, of course, leading that fight. That`s something we spoke about in our interview on the day that she announced her plan to break up big tech this year. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need real competition in this field. And there`s a problem.</p><p>So Amazon, Google, they own a platform, which is pretty cool, right, where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say, to Amazon in order to sell their goods. And they don`t just compete straight up.</p><p>They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide, oh, I`m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect. It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team.</p><p>My view is you can do, one, be an umpire, or the other, my view is you can be one, be the umpire or, two, own a team. But you don`t get up to do both at the same time.</p><p>MELBER: Right. And you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You dropped this plan today. This is your first big TV interview about it.</p><p>Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Warren rolling out one of her big policy plans, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen to-date from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s big and it`s bold, and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Could she really do it?</p><p>WARREN: You bet.</p><p>MELBER: What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN: The answer is yes. But you know, let`s be really clear about this. If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at 63 choices and get the one that`s going to be there in 48 hours, you can still do that as a consumer. This preserves the platform. If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it.</p><p>What this is about is about competition. It`s about all those little businesses and startup businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon or on Google and toward an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google, if they like the money they see that you`re making because they get all the information, they decide to go into competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s go to the way the Treasury Department is run because you look at it right now - I`ll draw your attention to a very simple illustration--</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: --under Donald Trump. We could put up on the screen. You have, in the red zone there, Goldman Sachs--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: --as part of Treasury Department leadership. If you go back, during the Obama era, we checked, and as you know, we had Goldman Sachs former executives running Treasury then. Go back to Bush, also Goldman Sachs. Go back to Bill Clinton, also Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In a Warren administration, would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN: Nope.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Oh - that`s a--</p><p>MELBER: That`s a litmus test.</p><p>WARREN: Absolutely. But let me tell you why. The problem we`ve got right now is a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington that causes everybody to be on guess for - wait a minute. The next time this Treasury Secretary puts forward a proposal, is it because it really helps the economy, helps the American consumer, helps the American homeowner, or is it because it helps their former and possibly future employer?</p><p>Let`s just do for one second the Gary Cohn example, another Goldman Sachs. Do you remember?</p><p>MELBER: (inaudible).</p><p>WARREN: That`s exactly right. So Trump appoints Gary Cohn. He leaves Goldman Sachs. And Gary Cohn is going to have exactly one job, and that is to ramrod through a rewrite of the tax laws that will profoundly affect Goldman Sachs.</p><p>So what does Goldman Sachs do as Gary walks out the door? They hand him nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. It`s a gift. They don`t have to. It`s--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Is it legal bribery?</p><p>WARREN: I think - I think of it as a pre-bribe.</p><p>MELBER: Pre-bribe.</p><p>WARREN: Yes. So Gary then goes out and guess what he does. He writes a tax law--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: --and manages to help ramrod it through, that benefits Goldman Sachs to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars in the first go-round.</p><p>MELBER: And what you`re saying--</p><p>WARREN: --and then it`s the gift that keeps on--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: What you`re saying makes sense, and we have such--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: --ripe targets. I think people could understand what you`re pointing to. But what does it mean for the Democratic Party if this was also how Obama and Clinton ran the Treasury. Would you be a fundamental break with that, I guess, is the question.</p><p>WARREN: The problem - I have written the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate because we have a fundamental problem in Washington. And understand, it`s a problem that pre-dates Trump by decades.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: Trump may be the most extreme example now, the pre-bribes of Gary Cohn, for example. But we have a long standing problem, and that`s the influence of money on decision-making in Washington. So this bill has lots of pieces to it, including closing the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington, ending lobbying, as we know it, putting a real ethics cop on \"The Beat\" saying that the heads of these agencies cannot be trading in stocks--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: --on individual stocks.</p><p>MELBER: So, as a political matter, are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money.</p><p>WARREN: Maybe. But this isn`t about the money. This is about how it is we`re going to make this country work again, not just for the rich and the powerful, how are we going to make it work for everyone.</p><p>MELBER: Everyone has been talking about the rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got. When you look at that, does that reflect what you`re saying--</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: --and Washington works well for the connected and the affluent and nobody else?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. It`s two justice systems. Look at the words carved above the United States Supreme Court. \"Equal justice under law.\" But look at the reality. People who got buckets of money and are well connected kept traded with kid gloves.</p><p>MELBER: So do you think--</p><p>WARREN: Everybody else doesn`t.</p><p>MELBER: Do you think when you look at that statistically that a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence?</p><p>WARREN: Oh. We know the data on this. Of course, the sentence would have been different. In fact, study after study after study shows that for the exact same crimes, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be prosecuted, to be arrested and wrongfully convicted and to receive harsher sentences. Race matters in our criminal justice system, and it is not a system of equal justice under law.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve got a couple of one-word associations. If you could do it in a word. Some of them relate to your bill.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: Amazon.</p><p>WARREN: Can I have two words?</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Google.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful. And that`s really the point of the too-bigs. It`s they`ve got too much power. And they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors, and ultimately to change the consumer experience. We`ve got to change that.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite song to work out to?</p><p>WARREN: Anything from Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Patsy Cline. Favorite--</p><p>WARREN: I love Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite album or artist when you were growing up.</p><p>WARREN: Any of \"The Beatles.\"</p><p>MELBER: \"Beatles.\"</p><p>WARREN: Probably - probably \"The White Album.\"</p><p>MELBER: Now, I`ve got to know your favorite Beatle.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, no, that`s not fair.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARREN: It`s like asking your favorite child.</p><p>MELBER: I would guess - what do I know? I don`t know you that well. I would guess Lennon. George Harrison? Boom.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Your dream running mate throughout history, living or dead, if you could pick a person that would run with you.</p><p>WARREN: Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>MELBER: A Republican?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Because he took on the trusts?</p><p>WARREN: Because he was brave. And he took on the trusts. And he didn`t care how many people were going to be mad about it. And he did it. This is what`s amazing, for the right reasons. It wasn`t just that they were big. It wasn`t just that they were dominating an economy. It wasn`t just that they were putting farmers out of business and competitors out of business and small companies out of business. It was that they had too much political power. And it was the very fact of that political power that caused Teddy Roosevelt to say, I`m going to be a trust-buster. Man, I`d like to have that guy at my side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: There is a beloved actress who`s been talking about you, Annette Bening.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s take a look. I think we have this for you. Annette Bening says she knows she looks like Elizabeth Warren--</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: --thank you very much. Now--</p><p>WARREN: Wow! I`m flattened.</p><p>MELBER: Does she look like you or do you look like her?</p><p>WARREN: Either way. I`m totally happy with this comparison.</p><p>MELBER: You like this?</p><p>WARREN: Yes, I do.</p><p>MELBER: Would you be comfortable - if and when there`s a Warren administration and then there`s a Warren movie, would you be comfortable with her playing you?</p><p>WARREN: I`m all in.</p><p>MELBER: You`re ready for that?</p><p>WARREN: I`m ready.</p><p>MELBER: We have to ask before we let you go, how Bailey is doing. This dog is beloved on your campaign.</p><p>WARREN: This dog is the best. Between the Bailey cam and the opportunity to meet people, and voters and people have been bringing him little treats. So Bailey is filling out now for a 10-month-old dog.</p><p>MELBER: And he has his own greeting line as well as you.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, man! He does a photo line like you wouldn`t believe. And I want to be really clear about this, Ari. It is not a competition.</p><p>MELBER: No.</p><p>WARREN: I say this because I definitely do not want to be in competition with a 10-month-old Golden Retriever.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve seen him. I`m a dog person myself. I`m sure he could get a lot of individual donors as well if he goes in that direction.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Warren, coming here on the day of your big tech announcement, we really appreciate it. Hope you come back on \"The Beat.\"</p><p>WARREN: Good.</p><p>MELBER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: We`re going to show you a lot more ahead on this holiday special of \"The Beat,\" including my conversation with Oscar-winning Director Lee Daniels, part of many of our \"Mavericks\" highlights.</p><p>MELBER: Welcome back to our holiday special. Over this whole year, some \"Beat\" viewers come up to me and say, what is the deal with all the music stuff? Some others of you have said, well, thank you for adding some culture into the news. And honestly, culture already is in our life and in our politics.</p><p>The only question in the newsroom is whether we face it or just ignore it. Artists often form our first view of things, whether it`s Bruce Springsteen or Bob Dylan making us think about America or Joni Mitchell and Muhammad Ali making us think about our foreign policy.</p><p>This year, I think we had our mind expanded by several artists on \"The Beat.\" Take Lee Daniels, award-winning Director of \"Precious,\" \"The Butler,\" \"Monster`s Ball,\" and the hit show, \"Empire.\" He joined me for our \"Maverick\" series, discussing racism in life and Hollywood, why Donald Trump once asked him to direct a movie, and then this exchange that many of you have written in about.</p><p>Daniels opening up about the emotional moment when Halle Berry won an Oscar for a leading role in his film, \"Monster`s Ball,\" in 2002.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Where were you when Halle Berry was the first black woman to win an Oscar for a lead role in that movie?</p><p>LEE DANIELS, AMERICAN FILM WRITER, DIRECTOR &amp; PRODUCER: I was in a hotel. You`ve clearly done your homework. Have you?</p><p>MELBER: I do some homework. All right. There you go.</p><p>DANIELS: Yes. I was in a hotel, inebriated.</p><p>MELBER: Not expecting to win then? Or inebriated regardless?</p><p>DANIELS: Not expecting to win at all. Invited, but not - I didn`t intend on - didn`t feel like I deserved to be there.</p><p>MELBER: Why not? You were part of the movie.</p><p>DANIELS: Oh, no. Because when Hollywood tells you you do not deserve it, you sort of believe that.</p><p>MELBER: What hotel?</p><p>DANIELS: The Chateau Marmont.</p><p>MELBER: Naturally. A little on the nose, Lee.</p><p>DANIELS: Oh, yes? Sort of. I didn`t think I was deserved being at the table. So I didn`t - I didn`t go there.</p><p>MELBER: So that`s something people who think of you as this successful culture-creating star, frankly, might be surprised that even at that point in your career, even on Oscar night, you weren`t in the room - as you put it, inebriated in a hotel, and then this happens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the Oscar goes to Halle Berry in \"Monster`s Ball.\"</p><p>HALLE BERRY, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I want to thank Lee Daniels, our producer. Thank you for giving me this chance, for believing that I could do it, and now, tonight, I have this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIELS: That`s nice. I hadn`t seen that in forever. I hadn`t - think I saw it since that time and since the - since the Chateau Marmont.</p><p>MELBER: This is the first time you`re seeing it since that night. How does it look now?</p><p>DANIELS: It looks great. It makes me feel like I was just naive and stupid for not going. Yes.</p><p>MELBER: What brings the tears?</p><p>DANIELS: It`s a hard fight, a really hard fight. And she deserved it. Yes, she deserved it. It was a - that`s the first time I`ve seen that.</p><p>MELBER: She deserved it, but you didn`t think--</p><p>DANIELS: I deserved it? No, I didn`t think I deserved it. Yes, I was just doing another day - another day. I`m trying to think about what my next gig is at, where did my next gig is coming from and how I could change the world with the next piece of work that I could do. Something that was unexpected. So, she`s there. I`m in the bed with a crack pipe and thinking, OK, so what`s next for me? What - how do I - how do I change the world with the next piece of work that I want to create.</p><p>MELBER: How do you feel remembering that she thought you did deserve it and she thanks you from that stage?</p><p>DANIELS: See, you just don`t have time to take it in. You don`t have time. Life is so short that you just, ah, OK, thank you. You know? And you don`t really stop and take it in. And this time, I took it in. That`s why I became emotional. You`ll never see me cry on television again. That`s for sure.</p><p>MELBER: Yes?</p><p>DANIELS: Mm-mm (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Mm-mm (ph). I don`t think we have since. Our thanks to Lee Daniels for that candid conversation. We`re also thankful to a legendary singer I know you know about, Annie Lennox. She took us on an unusual tour of an art exhibit, tracing her work and life at MASS MoCA museum. This is also part of our \"Mavericks\" interviews. And it touched on how she pushed boundaries on gender identity and feminism back in 1983 when she was out wearing men`s clothing and touring worldwide with eurhythmics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When you were coming up in eurhythmics, the reaction around the world was, wow, how can she dress like that, or does that mean she`s gay, or what does that say about gender? And you said - you`ve said at the time, you weren`t trying to be a gender-bender. So what were you trying?</p><p>ANNIE LENNOX, SINGER-SONGWRITER: I wanted to be a powerful performer. And I wanted to resonate to people in a certain way. And I definitely, by the time Dave and I formed eurhythmics, I definitely had the sense of who I was and what I wanted to do.</p><p>And it was in partnership with Dave, who`s a man, and the sense of being equals. We were almost like twins on the stage. Like, we were each other`s muse, if you`d like. That is powerful wear a man`s - I mean, I didn`t always wear a man`s suit. I wore all kinds of costumes. I mean, that was one way to perform that made people think and had a very, very strong, powerful image, if you like. If I broke rules, they were very restrictive.</p><p>MELBER: Many people remember you wearing this \"HIV POSITIVE\" shirt.</p><p>LENNOX: I hope people remember me. And I hope that that message did spread. As an advocate for HIV and AIDS, I wore that T-shirt or T-shirts like that with the messaging on the front, and at the back, it would say, fighting HIV and AIDS. I`m a mother. So I think it`s the fact that I`m a woman and a mother and have been a young girl. And I identify with women everywhere.</p><p>For me, my interpretation of feminism goes right around the globe because beyond the unseen boundaries of our western bubble lie the biggest challenges for girls and women around the globe that there, you know, those are the places where we need feminism, female empowerment more than anywhere else. There`s just such a huge gap that needs to be addressed. We need to understand feminism on a global basis.</p><p>I come from a working class background in Scotland. I thought I understood what poverty was. There was poverty around. When I went to visit these countries, when I saw what was happening, you see children in rags, you see children that cannot go to school, you see children that cannot eat. And that`s a population level because of poverty. You - you don`t - you realize that, oh, my God, I didn`t know what poverty meant. When you understand the scale of it, it is very, very life-changing.</p><p>We all have things, baggage. We`ve all got experiences. We`ve all got memories. A lot of them we need to let go off as well. And we go through those phases. I`m in this kind of older phase of my life where I`m reflecting a lot back. A lot of things are memory for me. I`ve kind of re- created them in this dream-scape which is (inaudible) let you go.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: That was really neat for us to spend some time there. And of course, it was her vision that propelled her to the top of the charts. We checked. They sold over 80 million records worldwide and worked on the activism you saw there.</p><p>The `80s were also a time of artistic inspiration and revolution right here in New York City, the foundation for shifts across the culture. That`s something we explored in my interview with two moguls from Def Jam Records, who helped make hip-hop mainstream, Kevin Liles and Lyor Cohen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN LILES, AMERICAN RECORD EXECUTIVE &amp; CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, 300 ENTERTAINMENT: I believe rap music took on something from early rock-and- roll that said there`s a lot that we have to say. Remember, rap music was introduced on a corner and then maybe one hour every Friday night for a show.</p><p>LYOR COHEN, AMERICAN MUSIC EXECUTIVE: What was happening here in New York in the early `80s is fashion, art and rap music was bumping, colliding together. And the spirit of it was underpinned by affordable housing.</p><p>So the whole SoHo, where we are right now, was full of artists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Imagine that, Downtown New York being affordable. What he was talking about there was also of course including visual artists. And we heard about that in our series this year as well from producer Swizz Beatz. He`s working with artists like Kehinde Wiley to advance diversity in the often closed art world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SWIZZ BEATZ, AMERICAN DJ, RECORD PRODUCER, ART COLLECTOR &amp; ENTREPRENEUR: It`s something different to say I have Kehinde Wiley, and matter of fact, let me see if he`s around for dinner tonight. Right?</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>BEATZ: It`s very important for us, as a culture, to own the culture or pieces of the culture and change that whole concept of making it for other people to own, and we don`t have a trace of it left around where we can pull from, which is the reason why we collect and the decollection so heavy. We collect like we`re building a museum because we wanted to save most of these pieces, so the next generation and the youth can have something to pull from or go back to - of the history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: It`s living history. And those are just some of the topics we got to tackle on \"Mavericks.\" I want to share with you, if you want to see more of those, there`s longer in-depth interviews, and they`re all posted at msnbc.com/mavericks. You can check them out now. We`re not done tonight though. Coming up, some of our favorite funny moments all across this year on \"The Beat.\" It`s a highlight reel you don`t want to miss.</p><p>MELBER: How do you take stock of your year? Do you focus on the big stuff, the most intense memories, or maybe the goofy times that reminded you how much we`re all just people trying to make our way in this world? Well, around here, honestly, we obviously work on a television show. So many of our moments have been recorded for better or worse. And we`ve gathered them together to share with you. And a warning to viewers, brace yourself for some musical references, dad jokes and, yes, even - awkward silences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sit down because here it comes. \"The Beat with Ari Melber\" starts right now. Good evening, Ari.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s it, buddy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really expected a rap lyric for this one, Ari.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you really majority leader, if you`re not running this like (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To quote Jay-Z, when the gimmies (ph) in the system, ain`t no telling, will he love him or he diss (ph) him?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To quote Killer Mike--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A line from Drake--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Barr worked it? I think Barr flipped it and reversed it.</p><p>MELBER: Do you have any Killer Mike quotes for us, Bill?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do I - do I not--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A wise man once said, \"Nothing at all.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me get on my back, Joe, and say, lean back and welcome David Brooks (ph) to the party.</p><p>MELBER: It`s getting hot in here. Maybe not you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, I`m cold.</p><p>MELBER: Are you dropping precedence in your first answer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did. I`m sorry about that.</p><p>MELBER: It`s just got - just amazing.</p><p>You guys realize this is weird, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is super weird.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER (voice-over): The awkward silences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s reflect on that.</p><p>I did want to let this moment--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sit.</p><p>MELBER: --sit.</p><p>I don`t know what can you say.</p><p>That`s how they know about the Martians who landed here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s just (ph) same time.</p><p>MELBER: Actually, I`m making a joke.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to end with my bad holiday joke--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Are you saying the cattle industry had beef with Oprah?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MELBER: This is a holiday where you say, look, let my full report go.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just come on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is - this is--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait. I quit. No. Wait. Wait.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is ending toxic masculinity right here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: It all happened here. Thanks for being a part of it. We won`t soon forget it.</p><p>MELBER: Now, as far as we`re concerned around here, 2019 was not a normal year, and it wasn`t supposed to be because you can`t look at what`s been happening and act like it`s normal. So we`ve been doing our part night- after-night. We want to say thank you to the viewers for watching and supporting the journalism and what we do on \"The Beat.\" We want to wish everyone, of course, a very happy new year.</p><p>And I want to thank our team because sometimes I get people coming up to me saying, and they say, wow, how`d you find this or that was so clear the way you explained and reported that. And the answer is, well, thank you, but it is a huge, huge team effort from everyone here in our headquarters at MSNBC and around the building and around the world. We want to say thank you to those who put this all together.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

I am Ari Melber tonight. The 2020 race obviously heating up candidates making all kinds of cases to voters around the nation. And I`m thrilled to tell you, we have interviews with top contenders about some of these issues. Also, on tonight`s show a special report on Donald Trump`s obstruction, the evidence that Democrats say will be key as Bob Mueller prepares to speak publicly about it for the very first time in this upcoming congressional hearing. So that`s a special report, we`re bringing you in tonight`s broadcast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, later, we speak to a 9/11 first responder who`s teamed up with Jon Stewart taking on the most powerful Republican in Congress, an issue that remains unresolved. All that plus a very special fallback Friday. Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, Nick Kristof and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, the one and only p funk legend George Clinton will join us later. So, we have a lot to get to, but we begin right here with the race that is heating up this summer right now 2020. And who is making the arguments to be the nominee to run against Donald Trump.</p><p>The Democratic presidential candidates are going big and all kinds of ways like criminal justice, inequality, taking on Wall Street. And that is part of where we began a recent interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren talking about breaking up big tech and how she wants to hold corporations accountable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need real competition in this field and there is a problem. So, Amazon, Google, they own a platform which is pretty cool, right, where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming say to Amazon in order to sell their goods.</p><p>And they don`t just compete straight up, they compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide, oh I`m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect. It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball. And owning a team.</p><p>My view is, you can do one, be an umpire or the other on a team, but you don`t have to do both at the same.</p><p>MELBER: Right and you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You drop this plan today. This is your first big TV interview about it. Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Warren rolling out one of her big policy planks, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen to-date from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: for a huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s big and it`s bold and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>MELBER: Could she really do it. What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN: The answer is yes. But you know let`s be really clear about this. If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at you know 63 choices, get the one that`s going to be there in 48 hours. You can still do that as a consumer. This preserves the platform. If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it. What this is about is about competition. It`s about all those little businesses and startup businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon or on Google and who are at an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google, if they like the money they see that you`re making, because they get all the information, they decide to go into competition with you and put their product on page one and your product back on page six and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER: Your plan is enacted. Do each of those companies get somewhat broken up?</p><p>WARREN: So, what they get is, the platform gets broken off from the individual companies</p><p>MELBER: And you`re saying that`s good for consumers.</p><p>WARREN: It`s excellent for consumers because it not only means the platform will be level. You`re not getting something from Amazon pushed out in front of you and a better competitor hitting back on page six. It also means the next good idea has a chance to mature.</p><p>MELBER: Right. That Amazon just like everyone remembers, the booksellers is not going to be kneecapping everyone.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: You`re here on THE BEAT tonight announcing this plan today and you`re campaigning in Long Island City.</p><p>WARREN: I am.</p><p>MELBER: Where Amazon just pulled out. Is that deliberate?</p><p>WARREN: That`s right. You bet, it`s deliberate.</p><p>MELBER: What are you saying?</p><p>WARREN: What I`m talking about is how big these tech giants have gotten so that what we see, and we saw right there on Long Island City is they come in, they bully towns, cities, states, all around the country. The handful of tech giants have gotten more than $10 billion in breaks from towns and cities and states over the past few--</p><p>MELBER: Corporate welfare.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: So is that. Let me ask you this. Is that a problem with the incentives or was New York wrong to give them that much of an offer?</p><p>WARREN: The problem is The Hunger Games about it, because that`s what`s happening here and it`s a problem because it creates more concentration in the energy - in the industry. You know they`re not offering the cities and towns a zillion bucks and goodies and tax breaks to the entrepreneur who is getting started to the small business that`s trying to make a go of it even to the medium sized business and big business that want to grow more. No, this is about the giants who are able to swagger into town and say, play in front of me what you`re going to offer, and I`ll decide if I like it or not and then I`ll go somewhere else and see what they`ll offer. And by the way, if you start asking me hard questions about the jobs, about where the money is going to come from, about how much guarantee I`m putting into this. I`ll just get mad and go somewhere else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And here on THE BEAT we`ve been catching up with other candidates as well, including one who is pretty hot right now according to many political insiders that Senator Kamala Harris and she has a very specific plan to tackle inequality from a whole different angle. The gender pay gap.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I am proposing is that we shift the burden away from that working woman and instead onto that corporation to prove that they`re paying people equally. There should be a consequence to the corporation if they`re not paying people equally for equal work. Women deserve to be paid as much as men and they are not.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>HARRIS: And this has not changed over decades. And so, we`re going to have to change the way that we`re approaching the issue and the way that I`m proposing we change it is that the corporations have to make it their business to investigate and do an analysis of how they`re paying people and then they have to report that information and then that woman or even a man and anybody--</p><p>MELBER: Right, it`s gender. So, whatever is unfair.</p><p>HARRIS: But whoever is applying for a job with that business or might be a consumer of the products of that business, they can look up the rating of that corporation and make a decision about whether they want to encourage good or bad behavior.</p><p>MELBER: Now one more thing on the details if you don`t mind me nerding--</p><p>HARRIS: Let`s get into it. Please.</p><p>MELBER: Deep into the written plan.</p><p>HARRIS: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: You have a one for one thing where you say, OK,1 percent off.</p><p>HARRIS: Right.</p><p>MELBER: If you`re 1 percent off. Gender Parity. You`re going to give up one percent of your profits.</p><p>HARRIS: That`s exactly right.</p><p>MELBER: Now, I want to get your answer on the record you know people say things about you as a candidate. I want to think sometimes they say is, well, is she \"bold enough.\"</p><p>HARRIS: OK.</p><p>MELBER: I don`t know what that really means.</p><p>HARRIS: I don`t either.</p><p>MELBER: But I looked at one for one and I thought that`s really bold. I mean I read that if a company has a 15 percent pay gap which some do, as you just were telling us, they`re going to give up 15 percent of their profits.</p><p>HARRIS: They will be fined 15 percent of their profits from that previous year. Yes.</p><p>MELBER: So, that`s live. I mean are you hearing about that from your donors, from Wall Street. Is that for real, I guess is what I`m asking.</p><p>HARRIS: It is for real because look Ari, it`s for real that that woman is getting paid 80 cents on the dollar. It`s for real that that other woman is getting paid 61 cents on the dollar. It`s for real that that other woman is getting paid 53 cents on the dollar and it`s sitting at her kitchen table in the middle of the night trying to figure out how she can pay her bills when she wakes up at the same time the next morning as the guy who is working in the cubicle next to her. She performs the same work, but she`s not getting paid the same amount. That`s for real too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Meanwhile, civil rights were an issue that lit up the first Democratic presidential debate and another 2020 candidate you see right here, Cory Booker has been taking the issue head on. He recently testified on the controversial argument for reparations something that many Democrats have shied away from in year`s past. He`s cosponsoring the bill that would provide a way for Congress to fund and study the issue. And in our recent interview, I just asked him why now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I`ve lived and worked most of my life in low income communities, black and brown communities and have been dealing with historical headwinds of segregation, of redlining, of health disparities, of public policies being stemmed from Washington like the G.I. Bill and Social Security that were designed to exclude African Americans from the terrorism that reigned in our country for generations, all the way back to slavery.</p><p>This is a conversation that we have not fully had in the United States of America and how the roots of savage inequalities still being made manifest today because of a lot of that structural inequities baked into our system and dealing with this issue and finding real practical solutions to address those inequities and disparities baked into from our history is something that we must do. And now is the moment.</p><p>MELBER: You`re leading on this bill, Senator Bernie Sanders opposed reparations the last time, he ran. He now supports this bill but also said he`s not sure that writing a check is the answer. My question to you is one, do you two have the same vision on this right now and two, should the Democratic nominee to the Democratic platform in 2020 be for slavery reparations?</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, I mean that`s what`s become, a lot of people don`t like the word because it evokes this imagination that people haven`t and that`s being whipped up by opponents that thinks somehow this is going to be about one person writing a check to another person and that`s not what this is about. It`s about how can we continue as a nation to have the kind of deep systemic inequalities that we have that stem from income to health disparities to our criminal justice system. This is about actually leveling the playing field, it`s not about paying somebody off and to reduce this to this some idea that we`re going to write some check and be done with this issue is so wrong.</p><p>MELBER: Your bill basically would put a small amount of money in to create a commission to study this if you are running for president. If you have these ideas, is that enough or is it time to put the money directly into the program, why still study it at this point.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, it`s de minimus amount of resources to study it and have which will be historically the first conversation, literally the first commission we`ve ever created to see how do you address these issues. We`re bringing this commission together to study exactly what it would mean I think for you or I to prejudge what some of the best minds in America would talk to at the end of this process is folly. Let`s see what practical things people come up with maybe it will look like things like my baby bonds legislation. But right now, I don`t have time to wait. People want to try to cast this in some divisive way, erode the understanding that we have common cause in this and that there is an urgency in America because when an African American kid born in a segregated community, de facto segregated community, it doesn`t have wealth, it`s below the poverty line that actually affects the well-being of all Americans because nine out of 100 poor kids in America will go on to college while the chance to nurture their genius we`re all bereft of the possibility and the potential of that child. This is hurting all of America. We need to start having a much more nuanced conversation about this than just saying oh this is about one person writing a check to another person and wiping our hands of collective responsibility that we have--</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>BOOKER: To make our nation more just and fair.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Our thanks again to Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, a pleasure to have those candidates on THE BEAT and as always, I`ll mention everyone is welcome. Now we have a lot more to get to. My special report on the evidence that Bob Mueller put on obstruction against Donald Trump, which we expect to hear about in his first time ever public testimony. Later, the cultural backlash with Donald Trump`s harsh immigration policies, an artist who`s made a huge statement imagining American children in those infamous cages.</p><p>Later my interview with a 9/11 first responder who teamed up with none other than Jon Stewart. And they`re taking on Mitch McConnell. Also, later, a very special fallback with George Clinton, Nick Kristoff. We are looking forward to it. I`m Ari Melber and you`re watching a special holiday edition of THE BEAT on MSNBC.</p><p>MELBER: The biggest thing happening in the Russia probe as soon as the holidays are over will be where lawmakers bring Bob Mueller to Congress for his first testimony ever. They are looking for new explanations about decisions he made during the probe. Mueller is the second person to testify to Congress who was a principal involved in this matter. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks was the first. But she refused to answer virtually any questions about her time in the White House.</p><p>So, now in our special report we dig into the criminal evidence that Trump doesn`t want you to see in any televised hearings which include Donald Trump`s efforts to stop Jeff Sessions from ever recusing himself in order to control the rush investigation. Mueller vast evidence with the goal to figure out whether Donald Trump had criminal intent which is the kind of thing Congress can weigh in an impeachment proceeding, so consider that the House Democrats lawyer asked Hicks, do you recall after Sessions recused himself. Trump was angry and scolded him in your presence. It`s one of the many questions she ducked. But why? Well, we know when Trump took office there were all kinds of calls for Sessions to recuse because he`d worked as a Trump surrogate. It all came to a head though on March 1, 2017.</p><p>The Washington Post reported that Sessions had met twice with the Russian Ambassador and then hit it and the very next day, this is important. Reporters were buzzing about this issue. It turned out Trump had formed a clear view. He stopped during a visit to an aircraft carrier in Virginia and told the world, Sessions should not recuse. What you`re about to see was a moment that mattered in history because it made Trump`s life and first term much harder. Pressuring your former surrogate and now AG to avoid recusal adds to the very reasons the DOJ was trying to make him recuse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, do you still have confidence in the Attorney General, sir?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Total.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, Jess Sessions recused himself from investigation into your campaign in Russia.</p><p>TRUMP: So far, we don`t think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Now we know from the Mueller Report that behind the scenes, Trump staff was working overtime to stop the recusal. Trump urging White House counsel Don McGahn to talk to Sessions and tell him not to recuse. McGahn not only trying to convince Sessions personally. He also talked to Sessions own counsel, his Chief of Staff and even Mitch McConnell basically rallying the troops to make the case.</p><p>In the end, it didn`t work. Here was Sessions an hour after that clip I just played of Trump making his case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That changed everything, and Trump didn`t like it. Now the details of the private reaction get pretty startling. Remember, Trump calls McGahn into his office, opens the conversation by saying, \"I don`t have a lawyer tells McGahn. He wished Roy Cohn was his lawyer and he wanted McGahn to convince Sessions to change his mind to unrecuse. Steve Bannon would describe this as acting as mad as bad and had ever seen him and that he screamed at McGahn about how weak Sessions was.</p><p>This is all part of what the Democrats want Hope Hicks to be forced to say in public, what she knew about this. This was March 2017. This was before Trump fired Comey, it was before Rosenstein appointed Mueller, because when that happened. Well according to the evidence we have, Trump lost it even further. Sessions was at the White House. They were meeting about replacing Comey, they get the news.</p><p>And Mueller describes how Sessions leaves the office to take the call from Rosenstein who tells him Mueller`s appointed Sessions then has to go tell Donald Trump about all this who he knows thinks it`s his fault. Sessions tells Trump the news and he slump back in his chair and said, oh my God, this is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I`m F`ed. Then he was angry, lambasting Sessions for the recusal and saying, how could you let this happen, Jeff.</p><p>He then asked Sessions to resign and he agreed. Now, this is this stuff the Democrats want to put in the public record. Keep in mind, if you believe the Mueller Report`s evidence which is from Trump`s own people. This is this stuff that could have undone the presidency. There could have been a Saturday massacre. Now Hope Hicks told Mueller, the only time she`d ever seen Trump that upset was when the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out.</p><p>Now Trump appeared insistent, even desperate to try to get control of the investigation as it took down his advisors and saddled him with the highest prosecution rate of any President at this point in their term. Sessions recusal clearly made the effort harder. Mueller probing whether Trump`s attacks on Sessions were a new way to get around him, trying to make his life so miserable, he might just leave giving Trump the chance to pick a new boss for Mueller.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: So, Jeff Sessions takes the job. Gets into the job. Recuses themselves. I didn`t have - which frankly, I think is very unfair to the President. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, thanks Jeff. But I am not going to thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And this brings us to the next thing the Democrats want to put in hearings if they win these court cases, because Mueller finds that Corey Lewandowski basically tried to get involved with Trump`s request to have a plot to get Sessions to stop recusing.</p><p>Now remember, Lewandowski is not a government official and he has to tell Sessions he`d be fired if he wouldn`t meet with him. And then Trump was still out in December 2017. This was after Flynn pleaded guilty. Trump was trying to still get Sessions to unrecuse. He goes up to him right after a cabinet meeting and says, I don`t know if you could unrecuse yourself, you`d be a hero. But pretending it wasn`t an order by saying, I`m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. This is what the Democrats think could make a difference if they had it in hearings with those actual witnesses.</p><p>The evidence that Trump was trying to kneecap the pro, bend the rule of law, do whatever was helpful. Now after all this, Sessions says, it still wasn`t a close call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESSIONS: I felt I had to recuse myself and I felt very comfortable that that was the right thing. I thought if I`m going to have any integrity in any respect within the Department, I would have to recuse myself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: But now that the report is out and we`ve seen the evidence of how Trump has tried this investigation, Trump is trying to hold everyone back from answering Congress`s questions on obstruction. Remember, he also never answered them himself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: He was good for an interview. You didn`t answer questions on obstruction.</p><p>TRUMP: Wait a minute. I did answer questions. I answered them in writing, I don`t know. I answered a lot of questions. They gave me questions, I answered them in writing.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: Not on obstruction.</p><p>TRUMP: Look, George, you`re being a little wise guy, OK, which is typical for you, just so you understand. Very simple. It`s very simple. There was no crime. There was no collusion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: There was no crime. Now this is the heart of it. If Donald Trump gets what he wants, there won`t be any public televised hearings which he knows move people to discuss whether there was quote a crime. In the case of the President, it`s the Congress that decides that and all of this is an issue because it depends on whether you know what`s in the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He said no collusion.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: He said he didn`t look at--</p><p>TRUMP: George, the report said, no collusion.</p><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you read the report?</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, I did. And you should read it too. You should read it too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: You should read it, as he gets out of the car. But we have read the report. That`s why we report from what`s in it in the facts and that`s why it`s so interesting that Donald Trump has as always two strategies, a public one that says, hey, everyone should read the report it helps me. And then a private legal strategy that says, no matter what they will fight to the courts to prevent the report from being presented by the Congress and yes, on television.</p><p>Now we`re going to fit in a 30 second break and when we return a 9/11 first responder who teamed up with Jon Stewart to take on Mitch McConnell. I`ll see you in 30.</p><p>MELBER: Here`s an important story for any time, we`re thinking about American Independence Day and what America represents. What do we owe 9/11 first responders? As you may have heard some are working with Jon Stewart to make sure they get the benefits they were promised. There was intense pressure and Senator McConnell finally promised he would allow a vote for this 9/11 first responder bill.</p><p>It was Jon Stewart`s emotional testimony in Congress which called attention. For many Americans to remember what`s going on with this issue. The testimony included this embrace of first responder John Feal. He`s been advocating for 9/11 responders and victims for many years and we just spoke with him following that moment about who he feels is responsible for the delay in Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN FEAL, 9/11 FIRST RESPONDER: There is no fact this Republican leadership and that`s not me singling out Republican leadership, this is just fact. I`ve been doing this longer than anybody 15 years.</p><p>2010 Republican leadership, 2015 Republican leadership and again, I`m an independent liberal Republican conservative Democrat. I don`t care what your affiliation is, but when you put tribal loyalties in front of humanity, we have a problem with that. We have learned over 1700 meetings in 15 years. We met with everybody.</p><p>And the fact is that when they say, they are compassionate towards us to, compassionate towards giving us five years whatever is politically expedient for them they are compassionate. But we want is a 71-year Bill to coincide with the health care that we can pass in 2015. We want to be left alone.</p><p>MELBER: You don`t want a funding mechanism that brings you and as we see Mr. Stewart and everyone back every so often to have to deal with Congress if the point is you all served at 9/11, this is in dispute. And the Congress says, they want to fund and support these 9/11 service members, first responders of victims. Then why does it keep coming back and forth and Senator Schumer of course represents New York as well as being McConnell`s counterpart, the Democratic Party. He talked about this, he named checked you, curious to your response. Let`s take a look at that.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Leader McConnell and the Republicans have delayed this process as long as they can. They`ve limited it. We asked for permanence a while ago and let me tell you Jon Stewart and particularly the leaders feel and others have tried to keep this as bipartisan as possible, but they can`t, because it`s Leader McConnell and the Republican Senate blocking full, the full needs of the people who rushed to the towers.</p><p>MELBER: John.</p><p>FEAL: I watched that and sometimes I`m dismayed, and I have a good relationship with Senator Schumer. All three of them Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell should get in a room and say let`s do what`s right. They have a chance to take our worst day, our worst week in months after 9/11 to make it their finest hour right now to truly come together and make this a bipartisan effort. But yet they continue to put politics in the way.</p><p>In 2015, Mitch McConnell had a meeting with me and three of my guys, a firefighter, police officer and the warden from corrections all sick from 9/11. We were escorted to his office by four guards where they offered teams like we were terrorists. That`s not compassionate. I just had a cop who supposed to get 500,000 for an award he got $14,000 and he`s already in debt.</p><p>So, this is real. The pain and the struggling is real and you cannot play politics. We don`t have to put up with it. We put up with it in 2010. We swallowed it in 2015. But this time is different. We`re in the mood for a fight. If we have nothing to lose anymore then let`s do it. But we come in peace until we`re not able to have peace anymore.</p><p>MELBER: Before I let you go, I want to play a little bit of something we remember from Mr. Stewart right after 9/11, because I had people well outside of news and politics reach out to me after watching his testimony here last week. And from what I understand from you, he`s walking the walk. He`s working with you guys on this.</p><p>Let`s look at him after 9/11, a time when we thought about what do we do as a nation coming out of this. Take a look.</p><p>JON STEWART, COMEDIAN: Any fool can blow something up. Any fool can destroy but to see these guys, these firefighters, these policemen and people from all over the country literally with buckets rebuilding - that`s extraordinary.</p><p>MELBER: You`ve done things most of us don`t know about. Don`t experience or have the courage for. Walk us through what`s important given what you`ve been through that we take from this as a people, as a nation, and also the relationship you have with him because we`ll put on the screen as I mentioned, the embrace. You`ve worked with him a long time, the embraced you had last week. Tell us your thoughts.</p><p>FEAL: Well, I`m going to try not to cry. You know, Jon`s biggest fear all week was failing everybody that was sitting behind him, the 9/11 heroes, the survivors of Lower Manhattan, the cops and firefighters. And when we did embrace, I said Jon, you no longer have to fear ever failing us. You didn`t fail us in 2010, 2015, and certainly not today.</p><p>You know, we`re not surrogates for Jon Stewart. Jon Stewart`s a surrogate for us and Jon has served the 9/11 community. And I like to think his passionate plea to help those who suffer restore humanity not only across our country but in D.C. where it needs it the most.</p><p>MELBER: So when you were hugging -- that embrace was you telling him he`s OK.</p><p>FEAL: Yes. Again, it was like watching -- it was watching a perfection. If it`s just -- it was graceful to watch him do what he does and nobody does it better. And I`m blessed to be able to work within the 911 community, now in the veteran community.</p><p>And I`ve never been so humbled and blessed to have that in my toolbox. I have Jon Stewart, such a great natural resource and the most humble A-list celebrity I`ve ever met where there`s no yes-men, there`s no entourage, and he just cares.</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>FEAL: Every time he comes back to D.C., he knows everybody`s name. Everybody who has a nickname, Jon wanted a nickname, Jon wanted to get embedded with the teams, Jon wanted to learn the issue, and just -- he just wows me. Oh I`m bored by his compassion.</p><p>MELBER: Well, you`re talking about service, you`re talking about leadership, and it`s a reminder to all of us what we could learn from the people who`ve been there. Mr. John Feal, I appreciate you coming around.</p><p>FEAL: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MELBER: I really appreciate it, sir.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When we come back, the whole different kind of pressure on Republicans and Trump, this time over the Trump`s separation policy. This an exclusive interview we had with artist who took on Donald Trump and the racial underpinnings of immigration.</p><p>And later, a very special Funkadelic \"FALLBACK\" with Pulitzer Prize-WinningNew York Columnist Nick Kristof and the one and only funk legend George Clinton when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are seeing a breakdown not only of our moral values, we`re seeing a breakdown of our democracy.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What is being done in that building is being done in our name and with our money. It is wrong.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What will it take for President Trump to have an ounce of compassion?</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What in the hell are they hiding?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I put out a plan to end the private incarceration of our children in facilities like this, and part of the reason is because this is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Controversies at the border and the Democratic presidential debate has reignited immigration as a huge American issue recently, plus the reports of tragic deaths of people trying to cross the border, and horrific conditions exposed at many detention centers holding small children.</p><p>Now, Trump officials have previously insisted those facilities are more like \"summer camps\" than detention or jail. And that set off the Chicago musician Vic Mensa to create this new video and song. It takes on Trump`s claims and it`s called Camp America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VIC MENSA, MUSICIAN: So much fun, you lose count of the days playing hide and go seek inside of your cage. Daddy loves you, so he sent you away to Camp America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That very artist Vic Mensa joins us exclusively to explain why he`s taking on immigration in his music right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MENSA: I think like the rest of the nation and the world when I saw those comments by Matthew Albence who`s now Director of ICE saying that these immigrant detention centers which we actually are referring to as immigrant prisons because that`s really what they are, our prisons, were more like a summer camp than a prison which is you know, asinine on so many levels, but also creatively it inspired me because I feel that the duty of art is to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.</p><p>And this is a situation where you have a lot of people way too comfortable about atrocities that are being exact upon children, then you have a whole other side of the nation that is very disturbed by this. You know what I`m saying? So musically I wanted to marry these worlds.</p><p>And being that my father is gone in immigrant and I have you know -- that I owe my existence to immigration, I think that the fear of immigration that has existed in American history from the first day, I just find it to be wrong.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, and as you say, immigrants can come from anywhere. Human rights are important because they`re universal. But you didn`t just write the song, you`re behind the video that people see is as you say quite disturbing but also quite a choice. Why is it mostly white children that you imagine in those cages?</p><p>MENSA: Yes. So as I -- as I was coming up with the concept, I wanted to display the situations that are really happening in these immigrant prisons where kids have reported being tortured with plastic bags over their heads, families have reported being left with no option but to drink toilet water, kids have been sexually assaulted, all of these things that are obviously just human rights violations but I looked over because they`re done to people of color and they`re done to immigrants that are poor and are coming from war-torn countries. None of those things would be allowed to fly were if America`s prized white children at stake.</p><p>MELBER: That`s powerful when you put it like that. And so you were hoping that people watch this video and they feel how?</p><p>MENSA: I`m hoping that people watch this video and they think about how immigrants are treated in this nation, they think about how people of color are treated in this nation, and also that we can make the through-line, the tie-in from these immigrant prisons to mass incarceration, you know, because let`s not forget that this is not really a new issue or a new occurrence.</p><p>50 percent of the kids that are detained in America, American children are black children. We have a history of Japanese internment camps which they just turned one of those into an immigrant prison. We had American-Indian boarding schools where the sexual violence was rampant and cultural genocide existed.</p><p>It`s like this is all tied into -- it`s tied into kids being detained in Palestine, its overall xenophobia. It`s just kind of dictating the way that our world is working right now.</p><p>MELBER: You put that so -- in such a strong way. I want to ask you kind of a funny question which is coming out of hip hop. How do you feel both being a messenger for that pain as you say it`s coming out of even your own family experience, telling people you`re an immigrant, and a country that is both fascinated by those stories but also often scared, scared of the black male story or scared of what`s happening in that in the inner city? How do you see like the way you`re playing that roll out?</p><p>MENSA: You know that my role has always been an empathetic role, and I have empathy for others even if I don`t personally experience what they experience. And I think that when you start to make a human connection, when you see people as numbers and statistics, then it could get lost. You can forget that we`re all human beings.</p><p>I think that`s what happens with Chicago of the times and I`ve seen Chicago be used as a media scapegoat for Black Milk, criminalization or criminality, and look at Chicago. Remember when Trump used to love to say that? He`s like, don`t look over here, while I`m robbing American people, look at Chicago, you know.</p><p>And so, nobody feels like to be marginalized as just a number or a statistic. And that`s what I feel is happening in our border right now is that a lot of people are just being marginalized into numbers, when no, these are actual human beings. And what`s happening to these kids is scientifically proven to have adverse effects to their development as they grow.</p><p>MELBER: Right. Which is why human rights experts are telling us this is literally abuse. You mentioned Donald Trump. Let`s play a little bit of Donald Trump and some of the interaction he has as you know, with the culture because he is fixated on aspects of Hollywood and music. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We don`t need Jay-Z or Beyonce, we don`t need Lady Gaga.</p><p>EMINEM, RAPPER: Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada, or these horrible tragedies and he`s bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Women`s March this weekend -- and you hear Madona - -</p><p>TRUMP: Honestly, she`s disgusting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s disappointing and it`s hurtful. This is the leader of the free world speaking like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Do you think artists and celebrities have a special way of getting his attention?</p><p>MENSA: Well, you remember, rap used to love Trump.</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>MENSA: Trump was practically a rapper at a point in time. Like Trump was partying with all the rappers. I mean, there were still songs being made about Donald Trump up to life 2012, `13 --</p><p>MELBER: It used to -- it used to go on G-Unit Radio.</p><p>MENSA: -- you know, right before he was like Obama`s -- no, I don`t know, American Muslim. And that`s when all of us were kind of like -- you know, and I feel like we started to tiptoe away. But obviously Donald Trump is - - he`s a reality T.V. star. That`s what -- that`s what he`s doing now on the highest level possible. And I mean shows in the job that he`s doing as far as you know, policy and legislation, it`s like it`s just not what he`s built for.</p><p>MELBER: Not what he`s built for. I see on your shirt, we could show here, Camp America, Best Summer Ever.</p><p>MENSA: I want to shout this out because I did this shirt in collaboration with an organization called KIND which is Kids In Need of Defense. So you can go to my Instagram Vic Mensa on Instagram to find a shirt or Represent.com. All proceeds will be donated to legal defense for immigrant and children.</p><p>MELBER: Vic Mensa, shine a light on an issue that a lot of people care about. I hope you`re going to continue to get responses. Thank you for coming on THE BEAT, man.</p><p>MENSA: I appreciate you for having me.</p><p>MELBER: Absolutely. I appreciate you being here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: When we come back, a little journalism and a little music with Pulitzer Prize Winner Nick Kristof and the one and only George Clinton on \"FALLBACK.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: And now to a very special edition of \"FALLBACK.\" Joining me now, the king of funk himself, we are just living in his empire, rock and roll hall of famer, Grammy winner, George Clinton, who has led the bands, of course, Parliament-Funkadelic and collaborated across genres from Red Hot Chili Peppers, to Tupac, to Kendrick Lamar. His work has been sampled in hundreds of songs that you know. He`s now on tour for the final time through this November on the one nation under a groove tour.</p><p>And another groovy friend of THE BEAT, New York Times Journalist Nick Kristof who serve as correspondent all around the world from Los Angeles to Beijing, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and expert on humanitarian interventions and human rights across the globe. Thanks to both of you for coming on together.</p><p>NICK KRISTOF, JOURNALIST, NEW YORK TIMES. I`m delighted. I`m trying to learn some funkiness here.</p><p>MELBER: Some of the funkiness can be shared, right? Funk is the --</p><p>GEORGE CLINTON, MUSICIAN: Yes, you can see it.</p><p>MELBER: This is a dream for us. George, who needs to fall back?</p><p>CLINTON: I must say the major record labels and publishing houses you need to fall back on blocking the recapture of the intellectual properties of the artists over the years. You know, you get -- you get to recapture your songwriters after a certain amount of years. They started to block those recaptures so they need to fall back on that, you know.</p><p>MELBER: And can I double down on your fallback?</p><p>CLINTON: Please do.</p><p>MELBER: I think and I`ve learned a little bit of music from the great musicians that have come on the show, they also these industry leaders need to fall back on taking advantage of young artists who are so eager to get a shot that they sometimes will sign almost any, they don`t know what they`re signing.</p><p>CLINTON: That`s exactly -- you said it just like I wanted to. I didn`t know I have that much time. But that`s exactly what I`m saying. And even after you get to the point where you need to recapture the music, they jump in and block that, all these artists that you say just signed those papers that they didn`t know what they were signing. They need to fall back on that.</p><p>MELBER: Nick, what`s on your mind?</p><p>KRISTOF: This summer marks the 30th anniversary of China crushing the tenement democracy movement protesters. And I was there on that Square when that happened. It haunts me. And the fact that China now won`t even allow a mention of June 4th of that date or of the democracy movement to just try to erase that history, it is time for it to the fallback and honor some of those students and workers I saw who fell on that square that night.</p><p>MELBER: One of the things that cynical people say is well, who cares in other countries especially people in charge they can do what they want. But why is it you say that actually some of these authoritarian regimes do care about the words and images that go around the world about them?</p><p>KRISTOF: I mean, one measure of how much China cares is that any T.V. in China is showing in this MSNBC right now is going to have this section delete it because they censor anything that can come into the country that refers to Tiananmen, to the massacre there the -- what they`ve done to the internet underscores that.</p><p>And you know, we`ve seen in other countries in Taiwan and South Korea massacres later become studied and become overturned and at some point that is going to happen to China, and I`m going to see a memorial go up in Tiananmen Square to those courageous students of 1989 and I -- that`s the story I really look forward to covering.</p><p>MELBER: Well, amen to that. In a way, both of you are today talking about free expression which is a human right and is so important to human beings. My fallback is a little lighter. Now, you remember Bob Marley. You used to talk about songs of freedom?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes. What`s that for?</p><p>MELBER: Well, we`ve got something going on with the Trump administration that if you haven`t heard about, you got to hear about. You know, fossil fuels are controversial. People think about environmental protection. And the Energy Department under Donald Trump, look at this, is now trying to rebrand fossil fuels as molecules of freedom.</p><p>Trump administration rebrands fossil fuels as molecules of U.S. freedom, Energy Department trying to rebrand gas. This is a little Orwellian I think and it reminds me of freedom fries.</p><p>CLINTON: Yes. That was -- wow, that was good.</p><p>MELBER: Do you remember that?</p><p>CLINTON: I was being (INAUDIBLE). Freedom fries.</p><p>KRISTOF: Trying to reframe fossil fuels, I mean, that is quite a stretch.</p><p>MELBER: And I know this is a branding president, and I know that some of his supporters said oh, he`s going to do for America what he did in business, right. But if what you do in business or policy is just try to hide things with words instead of dealing with them, that`s not going to last.</p><p>KRISTOF: You can produce carbon emissions or you can rebrand fossil fuels.</p><p>CLINTON: Well, if you go into bankruptcy a thousand times, that`s the nice brand.</p><p>MELBER: You don`t think he was as good at business as he says.</p><p>CLINTON: No, no, there are many bankruptcy.</p><p>MELBER: What else is on your fallback list?</p><p>CLINTON: Well, you know, I`m a painter. I like to paint. And they got this robot, this thing that`s going to become a new thing in here.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, he`s artificial intelligence and he gives real painter some people say a run for their money.</p><p>CLINTON: Yes, I mean, that -- he need to fall back because see, I paint, I painted my shoes, I`m just not getting into the art. And they going to make robots to do that? They doing everything else?</p><p>KRISTOF: They`re writing new articles.</p><p>MELBER: This is -- you get -- you get into a deep place. Can artificial intelligence make art, George, do you think?</p><p>CLINTON: I`m sure they can do anything you can think about. I`m thinking this can be done. Pretty much somebody will find a way to do it. And intelligence, it`s copied on the computer. I`m sure they`ll find a way to do it. It`ll be accepted. I`m waiting on the hologram to come and take my place now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: A little Coachella hologram for you?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes, you know what I`m saying. Now, you going to have robots, you get robots taking your love ones from, you mate, they got all kind of robots in store for you.</p><p>MELBER: Let me tell you something. Nick is a little bit like some musicians where he`s a big shot but he also has a big heart, and you don`t always see that together.</p><p>CLINTON: Yes. But it works -- it works like that in the funk.</p><p>MELBER: What`s this?</p><p>CLINTON: This is the new one here.</p><p>MELBER: Oh wow. All right, these are your -- and this is everybody in the band too?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes, all the different band members.</p><p>MELBER: That`s fantastic.</p><p>MELBER: Which one should we give to Nick? I`ll give you one.</p><p>KRISTOF: To make you a little funkier.</p><p>MELBER: Give him one of them.</p><p>CLINTON: Which one is for you? Which one do you want, Nick? You pick it.</p><p>KRISTOF: Well, this is pretty funky? How`s that?</p><p>CLINTON: Well, you pick the funky one. He got funked. I would love to get you another one.</p><p>KRISTOF: I like that.</p><p>MELBER: All right, George and Nick, thank you.</p><p>CLINTON: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: And we will be right back.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Thanks for spending some time with us here on THE BEAT on your July 4th holiday weekend. Wishing you and your family the best. Now, we will be back here live 6:00 p.m. Eastern on Monday for THE BEAT with Ari Melber.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Ari, good evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: Good evening Peter. Thank you so much. We have a lot in tonight`s show. Donald Trump defending the crowd at that North Carolina rally that was chanting send her back as patriots even as he backtracks. Also how Trump`s attacks are crashing into his approach on immigration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Have a top Obama official in a special interview, later tonight. Plus it is of course the countdown to Bob Mueller`s now delayed testimony. It hits next week with new pressure on Hope Hicks. We`ll explain but we begin with the fallout from Donald Trump`s race baiting campaign all week. Trump today did a couple things. First, he tried to back up his supporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was hours after he also tried to claim that he is not supportive of that very chance that he authored \"send her back.\" Take a look just one day after saying he was \"unhappy,\" he now says these people who were chanting his words are patriots.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It was quite a chant. And I felt a little bit badly about it. I was not happy with it. I disagree with. You know what I`m unhappy with? I`m happy with the fact that a Congresswoman can hit our country.</p><p>Those are incredible people, those are incredible patriots.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That is the way Donald Trump has struggled to explain himself and his supporters in what he has uncorked this week. Meanwhile, some of the very loudest voices on Fox news which is quite loyal to the Trump administration are having their own troubles. Now you may say what`s the point of even looking at this but it shows where the line is and maybe the line is in a bad place, a low place, a sad place. But there are still lines and we`re seeing a real struggle from these loyalists to explain how anyone could abide by what happened at that rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: I don`t think they were saying send her back as much as they`re saying these views are repugnant.</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, FOX NEWS HOST: Some people at Trump rally make some innocent little chant, board of fun, people having fun, it`s a take-off on lock her up.</p><p>JESSE WATERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Citizens of this country in North Carolina having a little fun, maybe getting carried away. They chant some pretty bad stuff for the football game. Politics is a top sport.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Maybe carried away or maybe the words don`t mean what they said. Sean Hannity becoming quite relativist because if everyone was chanting a criticism of the Congresswoman`s views, repugnant or not, that would not be the problem they have today.</p><p>It was 13 seconds that went on. We showed that earlier in our broadcast this week where Donald Trump stood by and basically seemed to really be fine with what he heard and it wasn`t an isolated moment. None of this takes place in a vacuum.</p><p>During that same rally I want you to understand a wider context. At one point Donald Trump pointed to a baby wearing an onesie that said Trump on the front and Q on the back, you see it there, seeming to welcome a conspiracy theory that`s been widely discredited and I`m not going to repeat its claims here.</p><p>Joining me for more context is a member democratic leadership, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He also serves on the Judiciary Committee. Brittney Cooper, professor at Rutgers and author of the book `Eloquent Rage,` and Afaf Nasher, Executive Director of the Council on American Islamic relations, thanks to all of you for being here.</p><p>AFAF NASHER, EXCUTIVE DIRECTOR, COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS: Thank you.</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Good to be here.</p><p>MELBER: Congressman, at the highest level, you and your colleagues have just said this is racist and you in trying that this week, taking that unusual step to rebuke Donald Trump. At a more granular level it does seem that it got out of hand even for Trump, what does it mean to you that he tried to back away and at times lie about what he did this week.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Well, in my view, there may have been some individuals close to him saying this is getting out of control and for at least 24 hours, he walked things back and then he walked back to walk back. And at the end of the day that shows you that he is who he is.</p><p>He cannot help himself and it is a part of. Donald Trump as an individual to pedal this xenophobic poison and he`s doing it in a way that is increasingly dangerous. And I would suggest that some of his friends, his family members, his allies who pretend to believe in civility go to him and say, cut it out, you are crossing the line.</p><p>This is no longer politics, this is dangerous for our country.</p><p>MELBER: You say - you say it`s dangerous and you`re obviously in the political opposition to this President but you`re also a government official with an oath to uphold the constitution. When you see another government official urging on people in that crowd to chant that way, does it concern you that it could amount to incitement?</p><p>JEFFRIES: Certainly I think it demonstrates sort of a reckless disregard for human life. And a depraved indifference to the safety of those four members of Congress. He can disagree with their perspectives, he should not be jeopardizing their safety and wellbeing.</p><p>In a country one, where we have far too many guns, more than 300 million circulating throughout the country and we know there are some sick individuals and we`ve seen some sick incidents.</p><p>Both, in terms of targeting Democrats Gabby Giffords as well as Republicans in the context of the congressional baseball shooting, a few years ago. So this is not even a partisan issue.</p><p>MELBER: Understood.</p><p>JEFFRIES: This is an issue about decency, civility and the wellbeing of public servants and that`s why we have been saying that we have to ensure the highest levels that our four Congresswomen who have been targeted viciously by him are protected and we uplift their right to express their own views.</p><p>MELBER: Understood. Brittney, I mentioned the reporting about Donald Trump backing off because I think the details matter and it`s a reminder that cynicism is not the answer because it is - it is pressure and for some people activism and optimism that still our reporting shows makes a difference.</p><p>BRITTNEY COOPER, PROFESSOR, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: I also and I want to make light of this but you know, we`re not handing out cookies either. Now we`re talking about backing away from terrible, vile things and we`re also tracking something I want to play for your analysis which is not all Republicans of course are even running away from this.</p><p>Some are seeing this as a new type of political messaging. Look at this Republican Senator using very clearly coded language here at something called the National Conservatism Conference. He is teeing up on a word you may have heard \"cosmopolitan.\"</p><p>Now technically the definition refers to diversity so it`s already pretty clear what he`s saying and many people feel that it is an attack on certain groups. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MI): The cosmopolitan elite look down on the common affections that once bound this nation together. The cosmopolitan economy has made the cosmopolitan class an aristocracy. The powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities. The cosmopolitan consensus for the cosmopolitan class. It`s time we ended this cosmopolitan experiment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOPER: You know, that is you know, an experiment in using the wrong words and not understanding that words actually mean things. Well, the thing that bothers me about Trump and his cronies is that they have a long history of attacking women of color and it`s really important to say that these comments are not just racist.</p><p>They`re also deeply sexist. They don`t attack people of color. They also specifically go after women of color and it`s - and so we need to take the long view. This is Trump`s attack on journalists April Ryan, it`s his attacks on Maxine Waters, it`s even the way that he is locking up these babies and their parents at the border because he sees women of color as the people who reproduce all of these folks that are keeping him from making America white again.</p><p>There is a real visible reason why he has such a hatred for women of color and our job is not to play nice with this, it is to call it out at every level. It`s not to give him any credit when he backtracks because the other thing that Donald Trump does. He is a gas lighter. Gas lighters are people who provoke you, who do harm to you and then tell you that you were just imagining it.</p><p>So this is what they`re doing on Fox news. They`re saying even though we send her back, that`s not really what we meant. You know, so it`s like the abusive boyfriend who says mean things to you and then that`s the way you took it not the way I meant it.</p><p>MELBER: You know I didn`t know you would bring this up. We do have some receipts from Fox news for what you`re talking which is it`s everyone else`s fault but the person who wrote the words.</p><p>COOPER: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: --that the people chanted. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREG GUTFIELD, FOX NEWS HOST: They took his words and they turned it into something he didn`t mean.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If I were a subversive opponent of the President, I think I would have beat myself at a rally and get people to start chanting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wasn`t the one that was chanting it. The crowd themselves started chanting this and it wasn`t the whole crowd, it was a couple of people right there in the front but he didn`t say it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: He did say it, he wrote it and distributed it to millions of people and then it got chanted back at him, Afaf.</p><p>NASHER: Yes, time and time again and we`ve seen this President`s word reverberating through his entire choir, his entire base and let`s not mince our words here today. Words do have consequences and we see it. We see studies that say every time there`s a Trump rally in a particular county, hate crimes go walk by over 226 percent.</p><p>We see it here in New York where a mother will be outside at a local Target or a shopping center and somebody will come up to her and reiterate his exact words, go back home. We see it even from the FBI reports that tell us that hate crimes are up more than they`ve ever been in a decade and if you don`t want to believe our own government, if you don`t want to believe those that are reporting these crimes, then why don`t we believe the words of the killers themselves.</p><p>They guy that went into New Zealand and killed 51 innocent people while they were worshipping cited Donald Trump, in Charlottesville, it was a love with Donald Trump, in the Tree of Life synagogue, there was a reference to Donald Trump and his words. So we are not going to mince the words from the actions and say there`s no direct relationship.</p><p>There is a direct relationship and by the way, standing up for 30 seconds - 13 seconds, right? Sometimes admission of an act is just as bold as bad as an act itself and he needs to take responsibility for that as well and he has the power to do so.</p><p>MELBER: He has the power. He has the power. He`s the one who said he can shoot on Fifth Avenue. He obviously can stand down his folks and say, we`re not doing that.</p><p>COOPER: Right.</p><p>MELBER: Or don`t do it like that and Brittney, I think each of you have really cover the ethics and morality of this which is important. There are politics to this and one of the things I`ve heard from people in our work is that Donald Trump also has brought some strange bedfellows together.</p><p>None other than my friend Fat Joe who told me, he was surprised to find he was in common cause with Bill Kristol because they had a different history but they came together to stand up against what they view as Trump`s bigotry.</p><p>I`ve got someone else who may not be at that level.</p><p>COOPER: OK.</p><p>MELBER: But who I don`t think you`ve been partying with all that much from your writing.</p><p>COOPER: OK.</p><p>MELBER: His name is David Brooks.</p><p>COOPER: Oh no, definitely not.</p><p>MELBER: Right? So I mean if you and David Brooks 5-10-15 years ago, I don`t see a lot of co-signing.</p><p>COOPER: Not at all.</p><p>MELBER: Right?</p><p>COOPER: Sure.</p><p>MELBER: But here is David Brooks today. He sounds like you or you sound like him or you to agree on this central questions so I point that out and I read to you. The headline of the new David Brooks piece in The New York Times paper record, \"Donald Trump hates America. He suggests a true American is white. Trump`s national story is closer to the Russian national story than it is toward our own.\"</p><p>And he goes on to take a 2 by 4 to what he calls this hatred of everything that is good about America.</p><p>COOPER: Well, look, let me get on my Fat Joe and say, lean back and welcome David Brooks to the party. He sounds like me, he sounds like, us, our crew. We`ve been saying this and part of what has to happen on the Republican side is they have to recognize that Donald Trump in their reckoning with decades of rhetoric that has been anti-immigrant, that has been fancy people of color, it has been more subtle.</p><p>It has been more civil and the reason that Donald Trump is not horrifying them is because he says every terrible thing and he says it really explicitly. Do I think he`s a more extreme version of the Republican Party? Sure. But do I think he`s a logical extension if someone vocalizes the dog whistles they`ve been engaged in, it`s literally the difference between a person who says cosmopolitan and a person who says send her back.</p><p>But they`re talking about the exact same thing and so we need more Republicans and more conservative writers to stand up and call this man out and say this is not the vision that we have for America, that`s the only way this will change.</p><p>The other thing that we need to say which is why don`t trouble is so dangerous. He`s not a averse to inciting crowds to violence in order to serve his purposes. Remember that in the 2016 campaign, he called the people - when he was talking about Hillary Clinton, he said, well, you second amendment people might actually handle that.</p><p>So he actually give gloss to this violence and then gal lights and tells us that that`s not what he`s doing.</p><p>MELBER: I appreciate you citing those receipts as well. He also in the same month, you`re quoting from infamously said at a rally, he would cover the legal fees of anyone at the rally--</p><p>COOPER: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: --who engaged in violence. It`s not a drill, it`s very real.</p><p>COOPER: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: I do have to fit in a break. I want to thank Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, Brittney Cooper and first time guest here on THE BEAT, Afaf Nasher. Hope you come back.</p><p>NASHER: than you Ari.</p><p>JEFFRIES: Thank you.</p><p>COOPER: That`s for having me.</p><p>MELBER: Thanks to each of you. We have a lot in tonight`s show as I mentioned, Bob Mueller hits the road in Washington, testifying next week. Democrats leaking some of their Mueller playbook. We have that for you with Maya Wiley, David Corn.</p><p>Also a key committee now asking tonight brand new, did Trump DOJ stop a potential indictment over the fact that he was President here in New York and later Trump`s race-baiting rhetoric colliding with his actions in immigration.</p><p>I have a special report followed by top Obama official and later on in the hour, we`re going to show you Jon Stewart absolutely blasting Rand Paul over supporting 911 victims plus yes, it`s been a long week, maybe you need it more than ever.</p><p>Comedian Margaret Cho with of course the doctor, the governor, the Governor Howard Dean together tonight for fall back Friday. I`m Ari Melber. We`ll be right back.</p><p>MELBER: New heat on former Trump adviser Hope Hicks tonight stemming from the Mueller probe. These court documents that just came out suggest she might have misled Congress when she faced questioning. It`s a reminder though of how high stakes any committee grilling can be.</p><p>Hicks` problems stem from prosecutors closing that Michael Cohen campaign finance probe which the New York Times calls an apparent legal victory for Trump. But Democrats say there`s no time to celebrate. They`ll be deploying Wednesdays Mueller hearing to hammer shocking evidence of criminal misconduct.</p><p>House Judiciary Chair Nadler laying out the plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): We will ask questions designed to elicit the information designed to get the information out there that we want, designed to show, what his report found that is at odds with what the administration and the Attorney General and have been saying.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: I`m joined by David Corn and Maya Wiley, both experts on this Beat, nice to see you on this Friday.</p><p>DAVID CORN, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, MOTHER JONES: Good to see you.</p><p>MAYA WILEY, FMR ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Good to be with you.</p><p>MELBER: What are you looking for on Wednesday?</p><p>CORN: We talked about this a week ago and we thought he would be testifying this week and I said the key words were within the lines. You know whether he would stay within the lines that we expect and say nothing beyond the report or whether he would go well beyond that.</p><p>Even in terms of putting italics in, adding an exclamation point because he`s doing - I think even in doing a dramatic reading--</p><p>MELBER: What about a highlighter?</p><p>CORN: A highlighter yellow you know, whatever, emoji something that would just give some more attention to some of the findings. We saw when he did his press - that wasn`t a press conference, press appearance, it was nine minutes long. It gave a lot more juice to the report because it is long.</p><p>It`s and a lot of most Americans, in fact almost every American has not read it.</p><p>MELBER: What emoji do you give volume one and two in the report.</p><p>CORN: Mostly thumbs up. Maybe a little bit like that for some but I do--</p><p>MELBER: See because I think and Maya, I`m going to bring you in here. At the end of the day, volume one on whether there was election conspiracy was definitely one of these you know this emoji, right?</p><p>And then volume two was like a burning mad face of like Mueller in his legal way saying, there`s more than one crime here, substantial evidence of more than one crime.</p><p>WILEY: Yes and I think that was what was interesting about the road map we saw today is at least for House Judiciary Committee, they are going - I think that they`re identifying to focus on with Robert Mueller, are the places in the report where his report says things like substantial evidence, obstructive act.</p><p>Meaning you could literally ask Mueller to read the section or the sentence or they could read it and ask him a very pointed question. In fact, you found in your report that there was an obstructive act and substantial evidence that Donald Trump was trying to interfere with your investigation.</p><p>That is the kind of thing that is very smart.</p><p>MELBER: And this is the tension that that you lay out between you, the prosecutor telling us how to ask these questions and you, among other things, a Washington expert, anyone who`s seen a little bit of hearing knows they struggle to ask these questions the right away.</p><p>CORN: yes.</p><p>MELBER: Take a look at Neal Katyal who this week previewed for us how you`d really do it. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEAL KATYAL, FMR FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: So Donald Trump tweeted right after report came out. He said no collusion, no obstruction, totally exonerates the President. So question number one Mr. Mueller, Trump says that you found no obstruction, is that true?</p><p>Question number 2, Trump says that you found no collusion, is that true? Question number 3, did you did your report totally exonerate the President? Yes or no? Simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORN: Those are good questions and you have you know 24 or so Democrats in Judiciary Committee. All get five minutes. They`re going to have to really make sure they coordinate and don`t go in different directions because in between their questions, the Republicans were basically asking more like tell us ways that you`re part of the Obama deep state conspiracy that was designed to get rid of Trump ten years ago before we even knew he was going to run.</p><p>But the other thing to remember is, there are two hearings on Wednesday. The first is Judiciary Committee and they take a break. They will wipe the chairs down and they bring in the Intelligence Committee which will go up to the issue of Trump and Russia.</p><p>MELBER: But you think Neal`s questions nailing it that way are good.</p><p>CORN: I think those are good for the opening.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>CORN: But I do think and this is my bias, I wrote a book on this with Isikoff that focusing overly on the obstruction issue as opposed to Trump having played footsie with Russia and denying the attack and making it easier for Russia that that to me is the bigger deal in a lot of ways.</p><p>And to the American public, if you can`t convince them of that being a big deal than whether you obstructed the investigation is not going to be I think as important. It is important to us. We care about these things but I think the big story is Russia attacked, he helped, he benefited.</p><p>That`s in the report and that should get as much attention as what he told Don McGahn to say.</p><p>WILEY: Well, I agree absolutely with the importance of the attention on what Russia did and why in fact we should have a lot of serious concerns about Donald Trump and those in his administration even now, right.</p><p>CORN: Yes.</p><p>WILEY: Like Jared Kushner who are actively and aggressively trying to get the benefit from Russians and also the way their policies have lined up to benefit Russia which doesn`t make a lot of sense in national - in terms of national security.</p><p>At the same time I think the obstruction does matter and I think it matters a lot if they do what Neal Katyal is saying and going into the meat of it in their five areas because polls show that Republicans actually are concerned about if they - if they get the message, if they get the facts of the report they actually are concerned about whether or not there is someone in power might be abusing it.</p><p>MELBER: And narrowing the questions in a way that people actually can hear the clear - the clear implication. I`m sure you remember, common - formally known as common sense musician and you remember his song `The questions` David?</p><p>CORN: My favorites song.</p><p>MELBER: Where he says--</p><p>CORN: Why is this night different from all the nights?</p><p>MELBER: That`s the four questions which - which really relates to some of this. I mean, that`s an immigration story if you want. Exodus, movement of ja people as Bob Marley would say but Common famously asking the questions. Why I got I have I`d to get ID. If I had I`d, I wouldn`t need ID.</p><p>CORN: It`s Catch 22 but I will say--</p><p>MELBER: We`re out of time so keep it--</p><p>CORN: One small point.</p><p>MELBER: Nail it.</p><p>CORN: One small point.</p><p>MELBER: Nail it David.</p><p>CORN: Republicans want to make Wednesday into a circus. They`ll do everything possible to make that clear message not come through.</p><p>MELBER: But you can`t blame the Republicans and Maya gets the final word. Republicans can make noise, Democrats have the gavel. It`s up to them.</p><p>WILEY: Absolutely and you know, Mobb Deep because son, people scared you know why, Ari. Say it with me.</p><p>MELBER: Son, people scared because there`s no such thing as halfway crooks.</p><p>CORN: Get up, stand up.</p><p>MELBER: Fight for your right to party.</p><p>CORN: That works too.</p><p>MELBER: Wow, I think we did a lot here.</p><p>WILEY: We did.</p><p>MELBER: We did. If you`re watching still, thank you and thanks to David and Maya and although it`s Sunday night, we have a new special The Mueller report: What you need to know. It debuts this Sunday, brand new on MSNBC.</p><p>When we come back my special report breaking down the race-baiting and how it shapes policy and later, the fight between Jon Stewart and Rand Paul, guess who`s winning, tonight.</p><p>MELBER: This was not an average week in politics even for 2019 on Capitol Hill. Congress took three unusual actions over a few days. Considering and then tabling and then impeachment resolution for the first time since the Dems took over, voting to rebuke a President for the first time in a century and voting to hold two officials in criminal contempt.</p><p>Meanwhile Trump spent a full week on a race-baiting attack against minority members of Congress, culminating in his supporters now infamously chanting the very script he gave them, \"Send her back,\" which then caused such a backlash that Trump is now backing off and lying, claiming he didn`t agree with what he wrote.</p><p>Now, these developments are all tied together by of course racial strife. America`s original and enduring problem and they`re tied together by immigration. America`s original and enduring source of Americans.</p><p>Now let me repeat this basic but vital point tonight. When we say American, we`re virtually always saying immigrant. 98 percent of today`s Americans come from a lineage of immigrants, literally. Only 2 percent of today`s U.S. residents are from families that actually started out here as indigenous people.</p><p>Now some are of course not being literal when they say immigrant. They don`t mean all migrants as the dictionary word. They mean some smaller group that they don`t want here. For President Trump these days that`s sometimes Latinos and Muslims.</p><p>He originally backed writing discrimination against them into law, running on that Muslim ban which was later revised.</p><p>Historically for other presidents, it was Asians, Italians, Greeks, Jews who were sharply restricted by a 1924 immigration law. When President Coolidge signed that very law which discriminated, he said America must be kept American. Sound familiar?</p><p>For decades, U.S. immigration law was explicitly bigoted under that law he signed until the civil rights era beat back those policies and President Johnson ended bigoted immigration categories in a later 1965 law.</p><p>Now, since the 1960s, federal law has banned bigotry in who America lets in. Few would admit they want to go back to the formalized legal bigotry before then. Few but well, not all. In fact, you could count the first person Donald Trump put in charge of enforcing federal law Jeff Sessions because that bigoted 1924 law Coolidge sign that I`m telling you about tonight, Sessions said it was good for America in a 2015 interview with Steve Bannon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: When the numbers reached about this high in 1924, the President and Congress changed the policy and it slowed down immigration significantly. And we`ve been assimilated through the 1965 and created really the solid middle class of America with assimilated immigrants, and it was good for America.</p><p>And then we passed a law that went far beyond what anybody realized in 1965 and we`re on a path now to surge far past what the situation was in 1924.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: 1924. There`s been a lot of talk this week about going back. If you mean it geographically, well 98 percent of Americans could go back to their original families home countries. If you mean it in terms of time, Trump`s call to make America great again plagiarized of course from Reagan is seen often as a nostalgia for the 80s or the 70s or even going back to the 50s. Sessions wanted to go back to the 20s.</p><p>And this is where today`s race-baiting and immigrant-bashing and racist attacks all collide because this is the bigotry which was written into immigration law for decades only removed by relentless protests, civil disobedience, people facing beatings. This week some of the people who took those beatings are trying to defend America from falling back into bigoted policies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): You know, make America -- you know this hat make America white again. They want to make sure that people, certain people are counted.</p><p>REP. JOHN LEWIS (D-GA): The President of the United States of America is the flexion. He`s preaching the seed and sowing the seed of racism.</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD): They said the same words. They said, \"go back to your neighborhood.\" \"Go back to where you came from.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: In America, 98 percent of our families originally came from somewhere else. We`re not going back across the map, but there is a very real threat we could go back in time. That`s the challenge I`m going to discuss right now with the man Barack Obama just put in charge of the border when he was in office. Jeh Johnson when we`re back in 30 seconds. Nice to see you.</p><p>JEH JOHNSON, FORMER SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, UNITED STATES: Nice to see you.</p><p>MELBER: I`m back with Jeh Johnson who ran the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama. Good evening. Thanks for coming on THE BEAT.</p><p>JOHNSON: Ari, this is my first time here. I was brought here on false pretenses. I was promised it was \"FALLBACK FRIDAY\" but I`ll get over that.</p><p>MELBER: We`ve brought you on a Friday, and I promise to get you in a fallback.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, you did.</p><p>MELBER: And I will.</p><p>JOHNSON: Anyway.</p><p>MELBER: Promise coming in the future.</p><p>JOHNSON: We`re here for a serious discussion.</p><p>MELBER: Well on the -- I appreciate you saying that. On the serious side, what does it mean when you see this language and rhetoric hit policy and people around Trump say we should go back from before 65 when you literally had bigoted laws?</p><p>JOHNSON: Ari, I used to tell audiences when I was in office those who know history learn from it. Those who don`t know the mistakes of history are bound to repeat them. Seventy years ago yesterday, my own grandfather who was a sociologist wrote a lot about civil rights in the 1940s and 50s gave testimony before Congress seventy years ago yesterday and it was before the House on American Activities Committee.</p><p>You know there`s been discussion this week about if you object to government policy, if you complain about government policy, if you have problems with our government you`re somehow unpatriotic. And the first -- one of the first questions he was asked when he testified before the House on American Activities Committee is are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party.</p><p>And this is a man who was a World War One Vet, honorary degrees, had to deny that he was a communist, went on to say wanting the elimination of inequalities and racial discrimination is not wanting to subvert the government, and that was the threat of his whole testimony. And he was a man like myself who loves this country as a patriot but sees the problems and wants us to address the ball.</p><p>And so I listen to today`s debate about how if someone has a problem, if someone objects to the direction our country is going, they somehow do not love our country and I strongly object to any notion like that.</p><p>MELBER: I appreciate that. I didn`t know you`re bringing that but it fits right with the discussion of how far back where we`re going to go. I want to get you on the actual way this works. You`re one of the best people given the knowledge you have. What we`re hearing from Republicans and I had a the border chief on last night for example, is that basically, you have to overhaul these processes.</p><p>Take a look for example of Senator Graham saying overhaul asylum and you won`t actually have as many children waiting around. Chuck Grassley, we can put this up, says, I want to stop the separation of families at the border by repealing the 1997 Flores Court decision requiring separation of families and we`ll put that up as you answer. Basically is that true that if you made those changes, you would fix this.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, first there`s a broad consensus in the American public that to do anything in this space, you should address taking care of the people who were here, the DREAMers, but also secure the border. And that`s kind of lost in this debate right now.</p><p>The other large picture point is that to do any of those things you just said, you need Congress to change the law.</p><p>MELBER: But would those things be good?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, yes and no. It`s a little more complicated than that. The Flores decision was a settlement reached in 1997 that covered unaccompanied minors. In 2015, the judge overseeing that case determined that the settlement actually covers kids who are part of families as well.</p><p>At the time we -- I opposed that ruling and we argued then that it would constrain enforcement policy.</p><p>MELBER: So just to be clear. You`re saying on policy some of these Republicans do have a point that there are sort of grandfathered in restrictions that make it harder to actually be humanitarian about where --</p><p>JOHNSON: I believe that our enforcement practices, our detention practices which should be fair and humane should be regulated by the executive branch, not a federal district court in Los Angeles so there ways to do that. But in the overheated rhetoric right now, we`ll never get there.</p><p>MELBER: Right. Let me get you before you go on someone that you used to work with Mr. Morgan who I had on last night who wouldn`t say whether or not the go back statement violates DHS protocol. Take a look.</p><p>MELBER: Would you say that telling someone to go back where they came from violates those standards or not?</p><p>MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER, CBP: Again, you have to take every situation in context. If that does happen by employee, we will investigate it, take it seriously, and we find a violation as you suggested. We will absolutely impose appropriate disciplinary action.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Doesn`t the president send the wrong message to the country and the line agents when he engages in this kind of race-baiting and shouldn`t someone in that position be able to say so?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. The President of the United States is the leader. He`s a leader of the country. He`s the CEO of the executive branch. He has the largest microphone. He sets the agenda. And the Border Patrol is wrestling with a lot right now. They`ve got the crisis on the border. They`re overwhelmed by the numbers. They`re under stress. There was -- there were the social media messages that came to light last week which are horribly offensive.</p><p>And when you`re talking about the Border Patrol, it`s time now for strong leadership. And this is why having so many acting`s like Mark Morgan matters. If you have actings, you need -- you need people who are in Senate-confirmed positions to take a strong position.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>JOHNSON: If I were in office right now, I think I could safely say, if I had the crisis we have with the Border Patrol right now, I`d be in there saying OK, we need to really turn this around. And you`ve bought them doubt and tomorrow is the first day we begin to rebuild.</p><p>MELBER: And as you say, the President`s use of acting in the undermining of the authority of these positions has become quite a deliberate pattern that undercuts that. Jeh Johnson`s first time on THE BEAT, I hope not to last, and I hope as you said, \"FALLBACK\" next time.</p><p>JOHNSON: All right.</p><p>MELBER: All right.</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Jeh Johnson. Up ahead, Jon Stewart blasting Rand Paul. We`ll show you that. First, tech giants grilled on the Market over market power on Capitol Hill. That`s next.</p><p>MELBER: In a big story that has gotten much attention, the government just hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine for mishandling data if approved will be the largest ever and that`s just the start. Consider that while Congress received a lot of attention this week for all the racial controversies, it was doing other things.</p><p>Speaker Pelosi touting a historic vote to raise the minimum wage, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee demanding executives from Facebook and other big tech companies Google, Apple, Amazon, faced a grilling over competition.</p><p>Here was the scene at a dry but important committee on antitrust hearing pressing over Facebook and whether it has become an illegal monopoly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOE NEGUSE (D-CO): Is Facebook in your view a monopoly?</p><p>MATT PERAULT, GLOBAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT, FACEBOOK: No, congressman, it is not.</p><p>NEGUSE: When a company owns four of the largest six entities, we have a word for that and that`s monopoly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Now, the corporations deny that claim but they can`t deny their ambition. From his first days touting Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg said it would be more than a Web site or a dating site, he pitched it as the backbone of the internet. A fictional Mark Zuckerberg explained it in this dialogue from the Social Network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People want to go on the internet and check out their friends so why not build a Web site that offers that friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit, browse around, maybe it`s someone you just met at a party, but I`m not talking about a dating site, I`m talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: I`m back in the real world hearing this week. Some witnesses struggled to name one competitor to Facebook. That`s a problem because monopolies can be illegal and get broken up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HANK JOHNSON (D-GA): There is competition to Facebook.</p><p>PERAULT: Yes, congressman. There is.</p><p>JOHNSON: Who would be the competition if I might?</p><p>PERAULT: Many of our competitors are sitting here at this table with me.</p><p>JOHNSON: Any other social media platform that could compete with Facebook?</p><p>PERAULT: There may not be an identical competitor to Facebook --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And that became a theme. Corporations that dominate their product the way saran-wrap dominates, what do you even call it, plastic wrap? So it`s hard to even think of one other name brand. The execs did try to remind everyone their competitors exist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERAULT We face intense competition, Twitter, Snapchat. IMessage, Skype, Telegram, Google YouTube, and Amazon.</p><p>NATE SUTTON, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AMAZON: Walmart, eBay, Target, Safeway, Wayfarer, and Kroger.</p><p>KYLE ANDEER, CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER, APPLE: The customer wants to use iCloud doesn`t want to use iCloud, they can use box, Dropbox or any number of other options.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: I`m showing you this because it`s important, but it may not look super exciting. Politically the best thing going for these companies is how dry and complex these hearings might seem, but they do boil down to fundamental values.</p><p>Should our economy have competition or be a monopoly? Should you control your private information and maybe your kids information or should these corporations? And should new companies get to avoid law because of the accident that there are new companies so the old laws didn`t happen to mention them because they were written so long ago Web sites didn`t even exist? Or should they face the same safety protections as other industries or the way we protect food and water under the law?</p><p>There is a reason that monopoly is a bad word. If you remember the monopoly video games, I should say T.V. ads for the board game? It refers to unfair business practices. In the board game, in fact, of Monopoly, you can end up in jail, something that sounds increasingly fanciful for real- life corporate executives these days though this week`s record fine for Facebook and skeptical hearings do suggest some things maybe gradually shifting. We`ll keep our eye on this story and I`ll be right back with \"FALLBACK FRIDAY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Time now for a very special edition of \"FALLBACK.\" I am joined by comedian extraordinaire Margaret Cho. She`s headlined at Nashville comedy tours and done All-American Girl and earned an Emmy for her portrayal of the late North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-il on 30 Rock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In NBA action, Kim Jong-un won the championship today. Our brilliant comrade scored 200 points and then went hot tubbing with a couple guys he`s definitely just friends with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Excuse me, lady, you do the vow, you know, speak now or forever hold your peace.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God, are you --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I`m nobody. Kim Jong-il is dead. I`m only waiter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Only waiter. The new podcast The Margaret Cho is on the Earios network and her comedy tour right now is fresh off the bloat. Check that out. Also with us Howard Dean. You know him as a governor, a presidential candidate, a party chair, and yes, a doctor. Thanks for being here.</p><p>MARGARET CHO, C0MEDIAN: Thank you.</p><p>HOWARD DEAN, FORMER CHAIR, DNC: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Who needs to fall back?</p><p>DEAN: Well, my first is I use my role as a doctor. There`s a Congressman named Chris Smith who thinks that Lyme Disease is caused by a CIA drug experiment to -- and that`s the reason that so many -- 300,000 people a year get Lyme Disease in the United States. That`s pretty scary.</p><p>MELBER: Where do you --</p><p>DEAN: He`s a congressman.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, he`s a policymaker. So he`s ObamaCare policy, he`s in charge with --</p><p>DEAN: Well, he`s on the other side of the aisle so ObamaCare is not his favorite thing.</p><p>MELBER: Well, getting rid of it may be.</p><p>DEAN: Right, getting rid of it. I`d like to get rid of Lyme disease. Or actually maybe -- do we have to get rid of the CIA to get rid of Lyme disease?</p><p>MELBER: I mean, that`s a big question, because it -- does it trip you out how little some politicians know about medicine?</p><p>DEAN: It doesn`t trip me out how little they know about medicine, is that they`re willing to talk about it when they know they don`t know anything.</p><p>MELBER: Stay in your lane.</p><p>DEAN: Which is common -- yes, stay in your lane.</p><p>MELBER: Margaret, what`s on your \"FALLBACK\" list?</p><p>I think maybe it`s white people who think that they are people of color.</p><p>MELBER: I heard about this.</p><p>CHO: That`s a good -- I mean, can`t we have just one thing? I want to just have like people to own one thing being a person of color. I mean, white is a color.</p><p>MELBER: OK. I thought white was the absence of color on the color wheel.</p><p>CHO: Is it? I mean, well to me -- for example I guess, what I would say then to white people it seems like the absence of racism or the absence of hardship. That`s sort of my perception of white privilege but I think also part of that is like this thing -- this idea that we live in a world that is post racist or somehow we`re beyond that, but we`re in the midst of it.</p><p>MELBER: When you`re up doing shows, do you notice anything different about where maybe people or the culture are from reactions when you`re -- when you`re touring?</p><p>CHO: I don`t know. You know, I think that right now there`s a lot of people who are just very angry and very desperate. And now it`s actually crossing party lines. It`s not -- it`s not as ---we seem to see really this sort of allegiance to our parties before but I think now all of that has kind of gone away and there`s a lot of people that just need to laugh.</p><p>MELBER: Do you have anything else on your \"FALLBACK\" list?</p><p>DEAN: No -- well, Facebook.</p><p>MELBER: Those apps.</p><p>DEAN: The face app thing. I think Margaret -- this is on Margaret`s list too and she`s a lot funnier than I am so don`t dare say it.</p><p>CHO: No.</p><p>DEAN: But basically, there was a very funny tweet this morning on my Twitter feed from some older guy who`s saying how come the generations -- younger generation thinks it`s time to move out of their way if 100 million people are giving away their Facebook -- their facial recognition and artificial intelligence for nothing which can be used in -- you just have to sign something online that says it can be used in perpetuity for the rest of their life for whatever reason they want without paying them any royalties. There`s 100 million kids who signed up for this on Face App.</p><p>MELBER: But the --</p><p>DEAN: And it`s a Russian app.</p><p>MELBER: The counter-argument is it`s fun for five minutes.</p><p>DEAN: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CHO: Yes, but I mean, I already know where my wrinkles are. Like I know where they`re coming in. When you hit 50, this is not a fun app anymore. This is more just like a mirror.</p><p>MELBER: No, I heard you were also interested in one of your fellow comedians is doing talk about entertainment and politics. Jon Stewart roasting Rand Paul.</p><p>CHO: Which is great. And you know, this is a very simple thing. He`s just wanting to take care of the first responders of 9/11, people who were very affected by 9/11 by the tragedy, by the you know, all of the fallout not just you know, not that -- you know, PTSD of course, but everything, all of the stuff that was happening. They deserve to be taken care of.</p><p>And you know, Rand Paul is kind of using it as a platform for his own idea of like there should be somehow a cap on government spending and it`s just -- it`s confusing the issue. This is about taking care of people that we need.</p><p>MELBER: I want to ask you a serious question about this somewhat goofy topic, right, which is what is it about Jon Stewart as a comedic truth- teller that he`s been so effective? Because everyone has got freedom of speech but I don`t think people believe that if Dane Cook was waging this effort, it might have gone as far.</p><p>He has been by all accounts, my reporting in Washington, very effective at keeping this on the front burner.</p><p>CHO: There`s something to the fact that he was reporting news at a very difficult time in this country where people didn`t want to look at news anymore. They want to have some way to absorb it, that humor that would somehow help us but without losing the humanity, without losing the real information, without an apparent agenda, which I think Jon has always had.</p><p>He`s got an earnestness to him and you know, and I think that he`s really - - this is a really important issue.</p><p>MELBER: Governor, what do you think about that? Because in a sea of partisanship, division, and also frivolity, this comedian has been laser- focused on getting support to 9/11 victims since 2001.</p><p>DEAN: When Jon was on the air, it is -- this is a true -- the majority of people under 30 got their news from Jon Stewart every night. So I mean, he has enormous. Now those people were almost 50 or 40. So --</p><p>MELBER: Well, according to FaceApp, they`re like 80.</p><p>DEAN: That`s right. That`s right. So I mean he`s unbelievably effective truth-teller than he was 20 years ago.</p><p>MELBER: Governor Howard Dean --</p><p>DEAN: It`s my pleasure.</p><p>MELBER: Thanks for being here. Margaret Cho, first time on THE BEAT, thank you.</p><p>CHO: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: I appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Really great having that conversation. I also have some weekend homework. You never know when a former DHS Secretary will give you testimony from the old House on American Activities Committee. That`s what Jeh Johnson did giving us all some food for thought about how we handled dissent in this country.</p><p>Again, my thanks to all our guests. That does it for THE BEAT. I`ll be back here Monday night 6:00 p.m. Eastern and part of Mueller coverage next week. \"HARDBALL\" is up next.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

We have a big show on THE BEAT planned tonight.</p><p>In one moment I will be joined live by House Judiciary Chair, Jerry Nadler, discussing why the House is not holding Attorney General Bill Barr and Former White House Counsel Don McGahn in criminal contempt and why they say they have some breakthroughs and they`re going to vote to make it easier to go to court and enforce these subpoenas for key evidence.</p><p>The party`s leaders meanwhile insisting today all of this will help hold the administration formally accountable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): When a Congressional Committee issues a subpoena compliance is not optional.</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD): The Trump administration is engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who does he think he is? A dictator?</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We must follow the facts and uncover the truth for the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: As promised, right now live, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler joining us for an exclusive interview. His first since the Mueller report hearing. Good day to you Chairman. We`ll get to that vote, but first on that hearing you led yesterday, what in your view did it accomplish? What did it show the American public?</p><p>NADLER: Well, what it accomplished was to start going through the evidence in the Mueller report and we had not only John Dean, a former White House counsel and the former Chief Republican Counsel for the Judiciary Committee, interestingly enough.</p><p>But two veteran U.S. attorneys - veteran U.S. prosecutors whom you know from MSNBC, Barbara McQuade and Joyce Vance, who went through the instances of obstruction of justice in detail that are laid out in the Mueller report.</p><p>And who said why and in many of the cases, they would - the evidence was in the report by itself was very sufficient to establish the criminal case of obstruction of justice against the President. And why if they were still U.S. attorneys and were presented with that evidence, they would have prosecuted and prosecuted successfully.</p><p>And that was, obviously, very important to show the American people that no person is above the law and that we have to start getting this information now. The fact is that it would have been better, obviously, had we had the fact witnesses, Don McGahn, the former counsel to the President who could have spoken about what he`s reported to have said in the Mueller report.</p><p>But the administration has down the line opposed our subpoenas and not complied with congressional subpoenas, which is why what we did today, the House of passing a resolution enforcing - a contempt resolution giving us the power to enforce our subpoenas in court was so important.</p><p>MELBER: So you mentioned that there you voted today on this contempt move. These officials - especially, lawyers, but really anyone responsible doesn`t want to be held in contempt. It`s a serious step you`ve taken.</p><p>But you`ve also stopped short of criminal contempt for attorney General Barr. And as you said, and we`ve been reporting that`s because you say there`s a breakthrough and in providing evidence to you. Why did you stop short of criminal contempt for Mr. McGahn?</p><p>NADLER: We did not stop short of contempt for Mr. McGahn--</p><p>MELBER: Criminal content.</p><p>NADLER: Well, the resolution empowers contempt period - civil or criminal frankly. If Mr. McGahn does not comply with our subpoena promptly, we will go to court to force his compliance and we`ll use the contempt power.</p><p>That is the whole point of the resolution. And we will use it on Mr. McGahn, we`ll use it on any other witness, for instance, Hope Hicks or Annie Donaldson if they don`t comply with our subpoenas and testify and give us the information and the documents that we have requested.</p><p>Now with respect to Attorney General Barr, we - our subpoena asked him a couple months ago for the redacted portions of the Mueller report and for underlying evidence in it. They refused to give it to us, which is why we cited him for contempt of the Committee.</p><p>But we`ve gotten - as of as of yesterday or day before yesterday we got - yesterday morning actually, we have an agreement with the Justice Department that they will give us access to the redacted portions of the Mueller report except for the grand jury evidence. We will go to court to get the grand jury evidence.</p><p>And they have agreed to give us in priority, order with us establishing the priority, the underlying evidence under the Mueller report. If they do that in good faith then there`s no point to holding - to going forward with a contempt proceeding against Attorney General Barr.</p><p>If they don`t do what they`ve agreed to do in good faith, then we will proceed with the content proceeding against the Attorney General.</p><p>MELBER: So that - that`s a breakthrough. I mean, people ask whether the pressure works. What you`re saying is, if they hold up to what they`ve now told you in writing they`ll do, then your pressure and the contempt strategy did work.</p><p>Does that material include getting for example the FBI interview - the so- called 302 with McGahn?</p><p>NADLER: Yes. Well, it includes the 302s that we asked for under the Mueller report and that would include 302s from McGahn--</p><p>MELBER: Which is big. I mean, there`s been this whole discussion that McGahn is the most cited witness in the Mueller probe. That he appeared to outline things that Donald Trump secretly did, that he thought would stay secret. That formed what Mueller viewed as criminal evidence against the sitting President.</p><p>What do you want to learn? What should our viewers care about in that interview that you say you`re going to obtain?</p><p>NADLER: Well, we want to know exactly what the President said and what he said. And we and we should hear the - and the American people should hear the first-person accounts of what is recounted in the Mueller report and maybe some things that aren`t.</p><p>Did the President ask him to fire Mueller - asked McGahn to fire Mueller because he wanted to stop the investigation? Did the President - or asked McGahn after he refused to do so, to create a false record stating that he`d never been asked to that. That would be - that is total, complete evidence of obstruction of justice, violation of the criminal law. Those are some of the things we want to ask him.</p><p>MELBER: And if you--</p><p>NADLER: And it`s laid out in the Mueller report, but we want to hear that from him firsthand.</p><p>MELBER: And Mr. Chairman if you have that - do you view that as education for the American public to hear that from again a loyal Trump aide. This is not some critic. This is Donald Trump`s aide and innermost advisor in the White House, saying these things that sound really bad.</p><p>Or is that for your colleagues to try to push others who maybe have not been as concerned about this as you have or at least aren`t moving towards contempt votes and impeachment?</p><p>NADLER: It`s for our colleagues. It`s also for the American people. The American people have a right to know what happened. Remember, the Mueller report came out and said what it said.</p><p>And then the Attorney General came out and lied what was in - about what was in the in the Mueller report. And for five or six weeks all you had out there was the Attorney General misrepresenting was in the Mueller report, and saying no collusion, no obstruction. The President echoing that, and that`s the dominant ethos that was established.</p><p>Now the Mueller report doesn`t say that. It doesn`t say no collusion. It says not enough evidence to go to convict beyond reasonable doubt the crime of criminal conspiracy. It does show massive evidence of cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russians.</p><p>The Trump campaign knowing that the Russians we`re trying to help them and welcoming that help - that - that`s what I normally call - would call collusion. It shows that - it shows considerable evidence, substantial evidence in the words of the Mueller report of criminal obstruction of justice.</p><p>And the purpose - one purpose of the hearings is not just for people to read the report. The people are not going to read a 448 page report. But it`s important that the witnesses who give us this information, the person who heard from the President illegal instructions, were to testify to that.</p><p>MELBER: And, yes - well, I would say some people read the report. I know you the report, your staff, many people who follow this. But I take your point in terms of how the information gets out there.</p><p>Now you mentioned earlier, and I want to circle back to make sure we`re understanding this. You said, \"Well, contempt is contempt\". The history, as you know, was the Republicans held Attorney General Holder in criminal contempt. And the Democrats, when dealing with the Bush administration, will put up, so folks remember with White House officials Bolton and Miers, they were held in both criminal and civil contempt.</p><p>When people hear reports that McGahn is only civil contempt, is that less, is that a difference or what is your response to that?</p><p>NADLER: No, no, the resolution gives us the power to - for civil or criminal contempt and I think that`s why that threat is probably why the Department of Justice have to stonewalling us since March, finally made this agreement, which hopefully they will in good faith carry out.</p><p>MELBER: Understood. Another thing we want to get you on the record for, because it`s always interesting when we have you on THE BEAT, is Mr. Chairman these reports - I`m sure you`ve seen in Politico. They say quote, \"Chairman Nadler has twice urged Speaker Pelosi in private to open a formal impeachment inquiry\". Is that true?</p><p>NADLER: Well, I agree with Nancy Pelosi 100 percent that all options must be on the table. And what we are doing now and what we will continue to do is to get out the information through the resolution, through the lawsuits that we`re going to bring to enforce our subpoenas, through the hearings that we`re conducting.</p><p>Yesterday was the very first hearing on this whole subject. We will conduct more hearings. We will get the fact witnesses and we`ll have to see where it goes and all options are certainly on the table.</p><p>And it`s very important by the way for us to go to court as this resolution we adopted today enables us to do to get the witnesses, to get the information and to get the grand jury material, which we will do - which we have to do also.</p><p>MELBER: But when people say, \"Oh, Chairman Nadler is pushing Pelosi on this\", that`s basically true or basically not true?</p><p>NADLER: Well, Nancy is - Nancy Pelosi has said that all options are on the table. They are on the table. And when we get more information as this since - as this process continues, we`ll have to make decisions down the road.</p><p>MELBER: You`ve also been negotiating with now former Special Counsel Mueller. Has he agreed to come in voluntarily? Is there a date by which if he does not, you would subpoena him?</p><p>NADLER: Well, we`re carry on conversations with him, and he will come in. And if we have to subpoena him, we will.</p><p>MELBER: Would that be, say, by the end of the summer if he doesn`t come in?</p><p>NADLER: Oh, I would think it will be way before that.</p><p>MELBER: Way before that. By the end of June?</p><p>NADLER: I`m not going to comment. I don`t know.</p><p>MELBER: Understand. And my job is to ask the questions, but I respect that you have a process going. When you say this is the beginning, I wonder what else in your view, before I let you go Mr. Chairman, is important for the Congress to probe from the Mueller report.</p><p>We`ve talked a little bit about some of the issues in Volume 2 McGahn and those obstruction issues. Are there other things that concern you, especially given what`s happening now with Attorney General Barr when we read the reports about the way the President demanded things - personal loyalties and other things from law enforcement?</p><p>And is there any way that do you think that affects patrolling the oversight role what`s happening now?</p><p>NADLER: Those all go to questions of obstruction of justice, which goes really - it`s fundamental - it`s not a process question. Obstruction of justice is fundamental system of justice and to making sure that the President is not a king. That he is not above the law. That he has to follow the law and that he can`t escape the law and assume powers of a king against the congressional powers. Those are some of the key issues.</p><p>We also have to obviously look into all the questions about the collusion of the Trump campaign with the Russians - the Russian - remember what this is about. This is not about a private sexual affair as the last impeachment inquiry was the 20 years ago.</p><p>This is about an attack on our country, an attack on our democracy by the Russian government. And about the fact that many people in the Trump campaign clearly cooperated - certainly they knew about it, they - the report says they welcomed that attack. They welcomed the help. They cooperated - some people in campaign clearly cooperated in various ways and that`s clear collusion.</p><p>We have to look into this into where the laws are broken. But just as important is that, how the Trump campaign worked with the Russians to attack our campaign and what we can do to make sure to hold the people involved accountable.</p><p>But also to make sure that kind of thing can never happen again, which I noticed, that both - I think it was Donald Trump Jr. and Rudy Giuliani saw nothing wrong with getting foreign assistance in the next campaign. And that is beyond belief.</p><p>MELBER: Well, Chairman Nadler on the day of these votes and right after the hearing, fascinating to hear where you`re headed and some of the news you just made. And thanks for joining us on THE BEAT with your first interview since that hearing, sir.</p><p>NADLER: Well, thank you Ari.</p><p>MELBER: I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. And now for reaction, we go to Eugene Robinson, Columnist for The Washington Post and Margaret Carlson columnist for The Daily Beast.</p><p>That was obviously the man of the hour on a day when Democrats say they have a breakthrough, Eugene, in getting things from Barr that he initially wasn`t going to give, your top-line reaction what we heard from the Chairman.</p><p>EUGENE ROBINSON, THE WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST: Well, I`m a little confused. Does the resolution that was just passed say, you Don McGahn and/or you William Barr, are hereby held in contempt of Congress, you are charged with contempt of Congress?</p><p>Or does it use as some inherent contempt power to allow Committee Chairman to then go to court in order to enforce the subpoenas or somewhere in between? You probably understand the legal more than I do.</p><p>MELBER: Well, I will give you a little reaction to your--</p><p>ROBINSON: --to contradiction.</p><p>MELBER: I will give you a little reaction to your reaction and then hand you the ball back. I mean, what the Chairman is trying to argue is that the civil contempt process, in their view, is contempt, because it gets them out of Congress where there`s letters exchanged and into court where if the DOJ loses there`s a court orders to hand stuff over.</p><p>But as I noted, in fact, I think we`ll play a little sound for you and then toss it back to both of you. There have been times where the Congress explicitly said criminal contempt. That was certainly the case--</p><p>ROBINSON: That`s what I thought.</p><p>MELBER: --in Eric Holder, let`s look at the flashback to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Eric Holder today became the first United States Attorney General ever to be held in contempt of Congress.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH): I don`t take this matter lightly, and I would frankly hoped it would never come to this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Back to you Eugene.</p><p>ROBINSON: Well, maybe it`s a distinction without a difference. It sounds like a difference to me. But the other question I have, from what the Chairman said is. He had a hearing yesterday. Barbara McQuade, Joyce Vance established basically a prima facie case for obstruction of justice, which would seem to me to be a predicate for an impeachment inquiry, which would give Congress - would put Congress at the height of its power, its ability to compel testimony and documents.</p><p>So what`s missing in that - in the step from yesterday to today - if it lives it`s so clear-cut, why not take the next step?</p><p>MELBER: Margaret?</p><p>MARGARET CARLSON, COLUMNIST, THE DAILY BEAST: Well, first of all criminal contempt has a way of getting someone`s attention more than civil contempt, so there is a difference in that way.</p><p>And I don`t have answers to Eugene`s questions. I wish I did. Ari, you`re the better lawyer. But I actually have another question, which is given what the Democrats got today, the vote to enforce the subpoenas with civil or criminal contempt down the road. What superpowers does impeachment give Chairman Nadler or the Democrats that they don`t have now?</p><p>MELBER: Are you both - now, just as the point of order, are you both conducting a reverse interview?</p><p>ROBINSON: Well, we kind of are. But I can kind of answer - I can partially answer that question, because--</p><p>MELBER: All right. Look, Margaret is in the middle of the screen anyway. Margaret, you tee that up to Eugene.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Eugene, go.</p><p>ROBINSON: Well, I believe that it does - it takes off the table one of the arguments that the White House is making, which is that there`s no legitimate legislative intent for watering all this information. You`re not going to use this information to make laws, that`s what you do, you`re supposed to make laws, and you don`t need the President`s tax returns or anything like that to make laws.</p><p>Well, you certainly need that and everything you can get if you`re in the middle of an inquiry to see if the President should be impeached, if the President committed high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>So it seem to me that Congress has power to compel testimony, to compel documents, whatever it wants whatever it needs would be at its very height in an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, I would echo that also Margaret and then we`ll figure out who asks the next question. But I think as Eugene says, part of what we`re talking about - the reason why these things get into this weird inter- branch place is, we`re talking about what will convince judges on the D.C., District and Circuit Court of Appeals - and if they rule it stands, unless the Supreme Court wants to get involved.</p><p>We know John Roberts and others are hoping a sidestep Mueller related stuff. They`ve made it this far. Whether those judges think that certain arguments are stronger or weaker based on what Congress is looking for?</p><p>And historically the notion of potential high crimes and misdemeanors, whether they`re seen as valid or not, is kind of higher then, \"Oh, we need this information to help us legislate or hold another funding hearing\" and so I think that`s broadly true, but it doesn`t necessarily tell you who`s automatically going to win.</p><p>We`re in that sort of gray zone, Margaret of the question of when you go to the court and they say, \"Well, the AG has some good arguments for keeping stuff private and the Congress has some good arguments for what they need\". What are the things that break that tie, so to speak?</p><p>CARLSON: Right. But only in the tax question, is the legislative purpose legitimate or salient. And when Mnuchin responds or his attorney does, that without a legislative purpose why is Chairman Neal asking for these tax returns.</p><p>The court doesn`t have to accept that and they`re - I mean there`s a massive number of legislative purposes you can have.</p><p>And on these other matters, oversight committees and judiciary, Congress has a lot of power to ask for anything and have it come to them it`s the third branch of government.</p><p>MELBER: Yes. And I think I think the Treasurer was - as you get into that was throwing all sorts of stuff at the law. I mean, there is a rule, it`s somewhat arcane, but it makes sense, called a Bill of Attainder.</p><p>Congress is not allowed to pass a bill, for example, that says Nancy Pelosi`s taxes are lower than everyone else`s, and everyone going to say, why that`s a fair restriction on their power.</p><p>Well, likewise, if the President is trying to do things that would only benefit or largely benefit him or his companies, Congress can argue, they need to know some factual predicate for that to guard against that as a legislative purpose, right. And so there`s all sorts of interesting - you know we`re getting into the fog.</p><p>Before I let you go, real quick, what did both are you think in a sentence or two about Chairman Nadler`s apparent confidence breaking a little news tidbit tonight that`s saying, he would have a resolution on Mueller testifying way before the end of summer.</p><p>ROBINSON: I think that was news to me, because that didn`t seem to be going anywhere - or more much of anywhere and it brushed off the question of whether or not he would have to be subpoenaed. So it looks like they - looks like it might happen.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, and he - but he did brush off end of June question Ari that you followed up with. So not the end of summer, but I don`t think before the end of June, so--</p><p>MELBER: Right, you said--</p><p>CARLSON: So maybe we`re in July.</p><p>MELBER: It`s just like planning a party. You set the wide window, then you try to narrow in, is everyone free next week? No.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Ari, you made news. It`s July.</p><p>MELBER: Well, you said it, not me. We`ll keep our eye on it. Really interesting to hear from the Chairman, we appreciate his time and from two ace Washington journalists Eugene Robinson and Margaret Carlson, thanks to both of you for helping us understand it.</p><p>Coming up, new critiques of Donald Trump`s national security and military record - this is a big one. We`re going to get into it later. Donald Trump refuses to let anyone see what he claims is now that secret deal in his pocket. We have a fact check and my special report tonight, something we`ve been working on Trump, truth and journalism today.</p><p>All that, and before we go, by the end of tonight, by the end of this show, we`re going to show you some emotional testimony from Jon Stewart. Many people are saying was a moving rebuke of Congress and taking care of the people who gave up the most on 9/11. I`m Ari Melber, and you`re watching THE BEAT on MSNBC.</p><p>MELBER: Today Donald Trump used a lengthy and sometimes rambling appearance to defend why he folded on those tariffs and to insult Joe Biden, stoking all kinds of reaction about Trump versus Biden, which maybe exactly what Trump wants. A focus on the Democrat he`s attacking in the contours of their beef.</p><p>But that`s not our top 2020 story tonight, which is actually about some of the candidates Trump isn`t talking about, including one of the few veterans in the race, Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan and made waves accusing Trump of faking a disability to duck Vietnam. Now he`s saying this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: While the current administration lacks a coherent policy, it does show a pattern - a troubling one, when it comes to its conduct abroad.</p><p>This administration has embraced and emboldened autocrats, while alienating democracies and allies around the globe. It has undermined America`s alliances, partnerships and treaties. The pattern is that decisions are made impulsively, erratically, emotionally and politically, often delivered by means of early morning tweet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Buttigieg is basically ignoring Trump`s attempt to frame this race and turning the attention to one of Trump`s contradictions. He talks a big game, but avoided service. He actually has high approval on national security, even as he attacks his own military leaders and Gold Star families.</p><p>Trump has an obsession with the imagery and myth-making of the military from his own high school stint - that you see here at a military-style academy to his Trumpian treatment of the military as a kind of a branding exercise.</p><p>You see they`re stamping the MAGA slogan on camouflage hats, pictures are powerful and Trump has been supplying them. Mayor Pete, though, is now a veteran hitting Trump back with a rebuttal for this image driven age and hitting him with some wisdom that the musician Big Sean once dropped on anyone living a lie through the pictures they post. I`m an original, you`re just a reenactment. I live that picture-perfect life you lie about in your captions.</p><p>And to break all this down, including the puffery, we are joined by Paul Rieckhoff Army First Lieutenant Iraq who founded the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, thanks for being here.</p><p>PAUL RIECKHOFF, FOUNDER, IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS OF AMERICA: My pleasure.</p><p>MELBER: Your view of all this?</p><p>RIECKHOFF: Well the quote De La Soul, \"Stakes is High\". This is the highest stakes we could possibly imagine, right, war and international conflict, nukes. And I think that over all that the Democrats have a stronger hand than they`ve had maybe since John Kerry.</p><p>It`s not just Mayor Pete, but they`ve also got Tulsi Gabbard and they`ve got Seth Moulton all post-911 combat vets - and I`m talking about all new vets, new vets who`ve been overseas post 9/11, who are I think now really just kind of waging the first frontal assault.</p><p>And this is a military conflict. This was kind of the opening salvo from Mayor Pete and I think the difference here was timing and tone. Mayor Pete went first, right. He said I`m going to take on national security, defense- -</p><p>MELBER: He didn`t wait to respond on this.</p><p>RIECKHOFF: He didn`t wait and he knows this is a strong hand for him. I think, especially, I`m an independent. Many people in the veterans community are independents. They`re looking for that kind of signaling to hear that he will prioritize national security and defense. I think it`s a strong hand for him and I wouldn`t be surprised if Moulton and Tulsi Gabbard follow-on.</p><p>And then you start to open up that front on Trump, which I think is a real vulnerability, especially after the attacks on McCain, after the attacks in the Khan (ph) family. I think Trump thinks he has a stronger hand here than he does.</p><p>MELBER: You do a lot of work and thinking in civil military relations, which is complicated. One of the things that a lot of people felt before Trump took office was, maybe we try to leave more of those debates over who served what, when and how, and focus on policy who`s going to do right by veterans and have a good safe policy.</p><p>I wonder whether you think that might be antiquated for critics of Trump given that he picks beef with everyone over personal stuff, nicknames and the rest, and yet he`s getting away with Mayor Buttigieg argues, his bone spur defense.</p><p>RIECKHOFF: You can`t have both ways and you can`t separate the two. War is the extension of politics by other means and I think that Trump`s been playing with fire. I mean, the 4th of July parade is a great example. I mean that could go really wrong for him politically. But I think for in terms of our democracy, I think it`s going to go very wrong.</p><p>You don`t want to politicize the military. You don`t want to overuse them. And I think you`re on soft ground if you dodge the draft and didn`t serve yourself. So this is going to be an attack they`re going to keep up.</p><p>And there`s another part of this. Today every New York politician has supported the extension of the 9/11 health support. There`s one who`s silent President Trump. OK. He`s from New York. He says he supports us.</p><p>That includes the people - 9/11 was an act of war, right. My friends are down in Washington, I was with many of them in Long Island last night, raising money for the fight for fund. This is the extension of war and he`s leaving them hanging out to dry. So any minute he could--</p><p>MELBER: You think he doesn`t care about that--</p><p>RIECKHOFF: It doesn`t look like he cares. He`s tweeting about a lot of other things, but he`s not tweeting about 9/11 first responder. My friend Rob Sarah (ph) is an FDNY hero. He was there on 9/11. He`s in Washington now.</p><p>He has a hashtag My Friends Are Dying, that`s what`s happening. Our friends are dying. Congress can end this today. The President can step in and big- foot it today. That`s what Jon Stewart has - have been issued a clarion call to America.</p><p>This is a conscience calling moment and I hope Buttigieg and all the other candidates are respond. But Trump, clock is ticking, America is looking at you.</p><p>MELBER: Well, I appreciate you bringing that as well at the table and we actually have a little more on what Jon Stewart said that was so moving later in the show. Paul Rieckhoff, always good to have your expertise here and your passion.</p><p>And before I let you go, I`ll remind everyone, Paul has a new podcast, Angry Americans. You can find it wherever you get your podcast. Check that out because it is worthwhile.</p><p>Up ahead, an obstruction probe witness blaming Mueller. You won`t believe why. That joins -- that person joins me tonight. We`re going to get into it. But in 30 seconds, new fault lines on the battle between Trump and truth, a special report when we come back.</p><p>MELBER: Another special report tonight in the battle between truth and Trump, the free press and a president whose survival in politics increasing depends on convincing supporters to ignore the facts, to detest journalists, and to even deny what you see with your own eyes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are fighting the fake news. It`s fake, phony, fake. They are the enemy of the people.</p><p>Just stick with us. Don`t believe that crap you see from these people, the fake news.</p><p>And just remember, what you`re seeing and what you`re reading is not what`s happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: There is news on this front tonight and here`s the context for the battle. The facts keep winning not every time but a lot. Now, I don`t mean winning in the Trumpian sense about power, I mean information reported out by journalists still matters and people are processing it as facts. And those facts have consequences.</p><p>An example, in the news right now is Trump holding on tariffs. The facts about that policy reported, those facts do reaction in the markets in Congress. And now Trump`s effort to lie, lie about it are also running into a wall of facts that clearly is upsetting him.</p><p>Another example is when the most important economic posts the president fills at the Fed. Both of Trump`s favorite candidates were just stopped in their tracks because of journalistic reporting about their actual views.</p><p>Or take the issue of opioids. Trump ran on it. He`s talked it up as a priority. But did you know that when there was actually time to appoint someone to tackle it, Trump tapped the Congressman who literally pushed the law weakening the DEA`s enforcement</p><p>Now, real quick, how do we know that. Because of investigative reporting by the Washington Post in 60 Minutes which reported those facts and poof, that drug czar nominee was gone within two days. Facts.</p><p>If this sounds like counterintuitive good news, if it sounds less cynical than the conventional wisdom these days, that is also because Trump`s political messaging is about trying to distract from the facts and their impact to get you excited about the next clash and to breathe cynicism about yes, the press including us along the way.</p><p>But why are we doing a special report right now about this? Because the challenges facing the press are also broader than this president. That brings us to a hearing in Congress just today. A kind of hearing that doesn`t get much attention. A House subcommittee probing how big tech may undercut a free and diverse press and warnings of a crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): This journalism crisis is also a democracy crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A small number of companies now exercise an extreme level of control over the news.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Together, Facebook and Google have bought 150 companies in just the last six years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The very fabric of our civic society is at risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Now, this is tricky terrain. Our Constitution is skeptical politicians getting near press regulation. And while tech companies mistakes are stoking calls for more regulation, it`s not like everyone thinks well, Congress should call the shots instead of say, independent entrepreneurs.</p><p>But as journalists especially print journalists do the work that holds the powerful accountable, look at how their employers across the nation are getting decimated. One of the four reporters now gone, hundreds of newsrooms wiped out in the last decade alone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today the Dallas Morning News laid off four percent of its staff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the Denver Post, 30 journalists are being laid off there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cuts affected between 16 and 20 editorial staff in the nearly 70 person newsroom.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The move was part of their focus to become a subscriber first digital organization.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: These hits to journalism are not at all equally distributed. They`re really hard on local papers out in the nation which undercuts reporting in some of the poorer areas of the country both red and blue, costing those communities in all sorts of ways from representation to participation in civic life.</p><p>So where do we go from here on this? Well, today`s hearing implicates two forces that are squeezing the press right now. I`m going to say it. Up here a truther president pushing the press from above, but down here an internet business model that doesn`t always work for the press.</p><p>Debates over whether these rich tech platforms are good or bad for the press rage on. And of course, many news organizations deal with these issues just like you do. The platforms, Facebook, Google, whatever they offer, distribution, speed, and impact, but they`re not free. They take something from you in exchange. From you, they take your privacy. From the news, well, sometimes they take the labor that makes a headline worth clicking on.</p><p>Now, that`s a single way to measure it but tech companies draw over 70 percent of digital ads. Google`s -- Google makes billions off news features that it doesn`t usually pay for and the tech companies insist hey, this is what we`re supposed to do, exploit perfectly legal opportunities.</p><p>And their platforms, to be clear, have made many news outlets and reporters, more read, more known, more influential than they ever were in the analog era. So these tech allies argue if other information companies were good enough to do that, they would do it. It`s basically what Mark Zuckerberg character famously said in The Social Network.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you see any of your code on Facebook? Did I use any of your code?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You stole our whole goddamn ideas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fellows.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I continue with my deposition.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, you really don`t need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you`d have invented Facebook.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: You`d have invented Facebook. He did have a point or at least the character who said that, but not the whole point. Congress has set all sorts of limits on industries that impact the public interest from medicine, to driving, to information, to communications. That`s why there`s a whole Federal Communications Commission which was created long before the internet, 1934 actually.</p><p>Today`s hearing was just one maybe obscure start to a deeper debate that affects you in an era where the head of the federal government serves as a reminder of why we`re skeptical of any government intrusion in the press.</p><p>Think about it like this. Do you want Donald Trump having more sway over what`s on Google? A lot of people say no which is the argument against too much reg. But do you want these business developments to undercut the press as we know it all over the country if that is an avoidable thing?</p><p>It`s about more than headlines. It`s about the free press and free information. And I think in a democracy, that really does mean freedom. Well, what is freedom? Janis Joplin and Kris Kristofferson tell us it`s just another word for nothing left to lose. But when those local papers had nothing left to lose, they weren`t free, they were broke, and gone.</p><p>I think we need a Free Press which does have something to lose because anything less will be chilling for our democracy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: We have an agreement with the Justice Department that they will give us access to the redacted portions of the Mueller report. And they have agreed to give us in priority order with us establishing the priority the underlying evidence under the Mueller report.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Judiciary Chairman Nadler moments ago breaking a little bit of news on his new deal with the Attorney General to get more Mueller evidence. Barr though, the Attorney General under fire for the way he handled the Trump obstruction case. Democrats are vowing much more aggressive efforts.</p><p>Now Republicans to view their own witness at that very Nadler hearing we were discussing, former Prosecutor John Malcolm.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN MALCOLM, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: By not making a traditional prosecutorial judgment with respect to the obstruction of justice allegations, Mr. Mueller failed to fulfill that duty. By not doing so, the Special Counsel put the Attorney General in the difficult situation of having to make that decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And that very witness John Malcolm joins me now. Thanks for coming on THE BEAT.</p><p>MALCOLM: It`s my pleasure. Good to be with you.</p><p>MELBER: Did you have a good time?</p><p>MALCOLM: Well, I was largely ignored. I mean, John Dean got an awful lot of attention from the Republicans and the Democrats and I didn`t get asked a single question by a single Democrat. It seems that they wanted to hear what the other two prosecutors had to say in what John Dean had to say but not what I had to say.</p><p>MELBER: Well, as a Republican witness, we`re interested and we`ve been hearing from people on all sides of this. Let me play one of the more interesting but really disturbing in some ways claims that you made. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALCOLM: It is almost invariably the case that someone attempting to obstruct an investigation also engages in other nefarious activities such as destroying evidence, suborning perjury, bribing witnesses, or threatening them with bodily harm.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: I thought you laid out the law quite clearly there, but you were implying that the president never did any of that. As you know, it`s incontrovertible that he did that. Some of which is according to his own aides quoted in the Mueller report, and some of which everyone remembers publicly like telling people not to cooperate, calling people rats, the raising the specter of threats to people`s family about what could happen to them. Why did you choose to go that route when you know the president has done some of those things?</p><p>MALCOLM: Well, let me begin by saying that I`m not here to defend the president`s conduct. I am here to defend the rule of law. And I think that your characterization of the facts in the Mueller report with all due respect is somewhat hyperbolic.</p><p>I mean, saying that somebody is a rat or somebody ought to cooperate or not cooperate, that`s really no different for instance than what Bill Clinton did with respect to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: OK, but I`m not doing a news program about the Clinton impeachment.</p><p>MALCOLM: Oh, no, I understand that. But --</p><p>MELBER: If you want to do that, some time we can do that. And I appreciate your --</p><p>MALCOLM: No, but there are --</p><p>MELBER: Sir, sir, I`m hanging you up for a second. And I appreciate you depicting the media as hyperbolic, but I didn`t invite you on for media criticism. Let`s go to the quote and I`ll let you respond. Since you use the H-word, here is the Mueller report depicting the President telling Mr. McGahn to basically falsify records.</p><p>The press reported that the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. Trump reacts by directing White House officials, \"tell McGahn to dispute the story, create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.\" Is that not evidence of Donald Trump trying to tamper with the evidence the special counsel was getting.</p><p>MALCOLM: No. He didn`t tell Don McGahn to go to the special counsel and lie and change something to the press to get him to defend himself is not telling him to lie. Don McGahn said that`s not my recollection. I`m not going to do it. The President didn`t like it but in fire Don McGahn. There were no repercussions for that.</p><p>When he went and spoke to the Special Counsel, he never told Don McGahn, now, whatever it is you do, Don, you know, don`t tell him about the conversation that we had about Jeff Sessions. So no. Trying to you know, get a subordinate to go out and publicly defend him about --</p><p>MELBER: So you`re making a legal distinction. You`re saying that lying to the public is different than lying to prosecutors. I think that`s a fair point. But when you hear the reference to falsifying records, would that not be records that would be provided potentially to law enforcement?</p><p>MALCOLM: He wasn`t tampering with the record. He was asking him to create a record. And when he said, I`m not going to do it because that doesn`t jive with my recollection of things, the president didn`t like it but there were no repercussions from that.</p><p>MELBER: Well, create a false record, yes sir?</p><p>MALCOLM: He asked him to write what the president believed to be, and so McGahn said I`m not going to do it because I don`t believe it so. The president didn`t like it, but he lumped it. He took it.</p><p>MELBER: OK. And I appreciate you making your case. Let me also ask you about the other piece which was affecting witnesses. And this doesn`t -- you have to rely on the Mueller report. Americans have now become accustomed to the way the president talks about potential witnesses. Take a listen for example to him discussing his former lawyer Michael Cohen`s father-in-law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: He should give information may be on his father in law because that`s the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money -- that`s the money in the family. And I guess he didn`t want to talk about his father in law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Don`t those kinds of public comments also go to the President`s state of mind and intent to impact witnesses in your view?</p><p>MALCOLM: Michael Cohen was already cooperating so it`s hard to see how that statement could impact on anything. Again, I`m not defending the President`s conduct. The President does stuff all the time that is uncivil, intemperate, and impulsive, and stuff that I wouldn`t do. But there`s a difference between doing stuff it`s impulsive and uncivil and doing something that`s criminal.</p><p>MELBER: Right. And I appreciate the distinction and your candor about what you say is some perhaps mistakes or uncivil comments as you put it. Stay with me.</p><p>MALCOLM: Sure.</p><p>MELBER: I want to bring in another former federal prosecutor like yourself John Flannery. John, your views.</p><p>JOHN FLANNERY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: My views are that we have another mouthpiece for Trump. And the reason is I believe based on his writings, your writings, John, is that you believe the president can do anything and that he should be insulated from the Congress and that he can`t obstruct justice as John Dowd said. You pretty much said in your memo and your statement yesterday before the Congress.</p><p>I wish I`d been there to ask you questions about your belief that our president should basically be a monarch. You incited Alexander Hamilton in your address who in that particular publication number 70 of the Federalist Papers spoke about how wonderful dictators are and we shouldn`t get in their way because there are things that they have to do for us.</p><p>MELBER: Let me let John --</p><p>FLANNERY: And you saying that about this president.</p><p>MELBER: I lover getting constitutional, John. You cited Hamilton though for the argument that a president shouldn`t always have to worry that his government actions could wind him up in court. Your response.</p><p>MALCOLM: That is of course correct. I mean, you know, with all due --</p><p>FLANNERY: Well, then, what about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELBER: Wait, I`m going to Malcolm. I`m going to Malcolm. Let him respond.</p><p>MALCOLM: With all due respect, I don`t work for the Trump administration. I haven`t worked for the Trump administration. And I was in the Department of Justice for ten years and I have never said anything along the lines of the characterizations that were just given by this other person. Alexander Hamilton --</p><p>FLANNERY: Well, just read your own statement. Read your own statement.</p><p>MALCOLM: I would invite you please to put out on MSNBC`s Web site my statement for others to read. Please do that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALCOLM: Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Number 70 talked about the need to have a president who can act with alacrity and dispatch and verve. And the reason I cited that is because you should not have a prosecutor second- guessing a president when a president is acting within his core powers Under Article two such as appointing and removing officials and considering pardons.</p><p>MELBER: Briefly, John Flannery. Briefly and civilly since we`re being civil.</p><p>FLANNERY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir, civilly. What that particular provision said was the republic said Hamilton was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man under the formidable title of dictator. That is the provision you cited.</p><p>Now, as for faithfully executing the law a president abuses his power when he goes and pardons those who investigate him, those who would talk against him. He threatens them and exchanges pardons like his conversation that he authorized John Dowd, no doubt, to have with Flynn.</p><p>MELBER: Right. And Flannery and I have discussed some of that. Those are important points. Mr. Malcolm, you said you didn`t get questions or at least a lot of them yesterday. You got some here. You`re welcome to come back. Again, I have to fit in a break. I appreciate you taking the questions. Former federal prosecutors John Malcolm and John Flannery, my thanks to both of you.</p><p>FLANNERY: Thank you.</p><p>MALCOLM: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Up ahead, as promised, we explained -- we would get into what Jon Stewart said about holding Congress accountable in an angry speech over helping 911 victims. Stay with us.</p><p>MELBER: Now, an important story we told you we would cover tonight. Jon Stewart getting emotional today in testimony to it is United States Congress on an issue he worked tirelessly on for a long time as you may know. This is all about the compensation fund for 9/11 first responders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS ADVOCATE: A filled room of 9/11 first responders and in front of me a nearly empty Congress. Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak to no one. It`s shameful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Now, what does nearly empty mean? There were lawmakers who argued that that hearing was for a subcommittee so the turn out actually matched the scheduled number of people that were supposed to be there. But Jon Stewart may be arguing a larger sense, the Congress is turning up empty on its mission, its obligation in his view to extend this fund.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: They responded in five seconds. They did their jobs with courage, grace, tenacity, humility. 18 years later, do yours! Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Jon Stewart cares a lot about this and as you know, he doesn`t lack for opportunities to speak on television. We know that he turns many of them down. This is a place where he wants to deploy his platform. And many of us also remember his first show after the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: Any fool can destroy, but to see these guys, these firefighters, these policemen and people from all over the country literally with buckets, rebuilding, that -- that is -- that`s extraordinary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That does it for THE BEAT. \"HARDBALL\" starts now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSNBC-2019061101cb457</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSNBC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-SJ51-JB20-G4YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 MSNBC</copyright><publicationName>MSNBC</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Justice Department</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Judiciary Committee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Watergate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerry Nadler</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Don McGahn</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pete Buttigieg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>9/11 First Responders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOJ</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

We`ll be back tomorrow with more MEET THE PRESS DAILY. And we wish you all a wonderful and safe Memorial Day weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: Hi. Happy Memorial Day and welcome to this special Memorial Day edition of THE BEAT. I`m Ari Melber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, we have an interview with Barack Obama`s Attorney General Eric Holder. I also speak with presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren about how she is taking on Wall Street and big tech. We also have a very special Fallback featuring one of the stars from the hit show \"Queer Eye.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But we begin right now with these investigations into Donald Trump. The Mueller probe is over but it turns out that the legal and political questions are still piling up, especially with Democrats in control of Congress. \"The New York Times\" in fact counting at least 29 separate probes into Trump`s businesses, his campaign, his inaugural activities, and his presidency itself.</p><p>Now, these are operating at the federal, state and even local level. And those are just the ones that we know about. Sometimes, the biggest investigations remain confidential in the early stages. Now, the Mueller report revealed more than a dozen active criminal probes that were referred to other offices.</p><p>Most of those remain secret, totally redacted from public view. And then in Congress, \"The New York Times\" also has the count of 11 separate probes into Trump in the administration. Lawmakers want information about secret communications with Vladimir Putin and suspicious activities about the tax returns, a battle that is now in court, and also whether Donald Trump has misrepresented his net worth in potentially criminal ways or ways with national security implications.</p><p>This also is a bit of a family affair. Lawmakers investigating Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for alleged abuses in the security clearance process. As well as, yes, about her e-mails, their use of private e-mail for government business. It`s a lot.</p><p>I want to turn now to Mara Gay, a member of the \"New York Times\" editorial board and two former prosecutors from the very busy Southern District of New York, Jessica Roth who`s now a professor at Cardozo Law School and Maya Wiley, a former counsel to the New York mayor and an MSNBC analyst. Happy Memorial Day, everyone.</p><p>MARA GAY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Happy holiday.</p><p>JESSICA ROTH, PROFESSOR, CARDOZO LAW SCHOOL: Happy Memorial Day Holiday.</p><p>MELBER: What do you think of the number of these probes, what it says about the way Donald Trump has operated, particularly given the evidence required to even begin some of these probes?</p><p>MAYA WILEY, FORMER COUNSEL TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: So many probes at so many indicators of swirling corruption around Donald Trump. The question is will any of it stick directly to Donald Trump. And I say corruption, because if you look at the investigations, you know, they`re coming and emanating, for instance, from testimony that Michael Cohen gave both to Robert Mueller`s team but also to Congress about whether or not he was inflating his assets or deflating.</p><p>So those kinds of questions do touch directly on Donald Trump. But all these people that are around him, like Elliott Broidy, his top fundraiser, or this hedge fund guy Zuberi who gave $900,000 to the inauguration and 47 people gave more. And it was actually the event planner on a phone call with Michael Cohen saying that she was concerned about what was happening with the money in the inaugural fund.</p><p>So what that tells you is there are a whole lot of people surrounding this president who certainly appears to be morally challenged at best. And for Donald Trump, what he should be very worried about is how much of that will come directly back to him.</p><p>MELBER: And Mara, 29 probes is a lot.</p><p>GAY: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: 21 Savage, which is 29 minus 8 said how much money you got? A lot. How many problems you got? A lot. How many lawyers you got? A lot.</p><p>And we don`t know how much money Donald Trump has but he does have a lot of problems and lawyers. Some of them are in jail. Some of them are not.</p><p>What does it tell you that Mueller ultimately didn`t find the chargeable collusion conspiracy that so many people were wondering about, and yet referred so many federal probes?</p><p>GAY: Well, a couple of things. The first thing is that Mueller was very specific with his language. He said he didn`t find any evidence of collusion. That doesn`t mean that he ruled out the idea that there is collusion so to speak.</p><p>The other thing is that there are still open investigations into, as you said, the administration across the country. So that`s another point.</p><p>It also just says something to me about the president and his instinct, which is to keep everything that he does private and keep it from the public, even against our best traditions from tax returns --</p><p>MELBER: Right, obsessed with P.R. but super secretive.</p><p>GAY: Super secretive. You know I mean that may be because he has something to hide. It may be also because he just doesn`t believe that the American people or that Congress have a right to this information. I think both are extremely concerning.</p><p>MELBER: But it`s not because he is shy.</p><p>GAY: We know that.</p><p>MELBER: Yes. Jessica, I didn`t mean to step on anything you wanted the say about 21 Savage or mumble rap or whatever you want to get into. But given your SDNY expertise, I want to just put up here just the SDNY-related probes that we have right now from Trump.</p><p>The inaugural committee, the hush money payments that relate to a confessed election crime, the Cohen pardon offer which is under investigation, Trump Org and his insurance claims, Manafort`s foreign lobbying and a Manafort- linked bank officer seeking a Trump job.</p><p>Based on your knowledge of that office, are we likely to hear more about this and will there be more indictments? Explicitly on the campaign issue, it would seem with all of the cooperation they got that it`s odd that nothing else has happened publicly.</p><p>ROTH: It`s true that we haven`t heard much lately. What`s been reported most recently is that there were I think thousands of pages turned over to the Southern District prosecutors from the inaugural committee on the various matters that are under investigation there, including donations from foreign entities, perhaps unlawful self-dealings to Trump-related entities.</p><p>I`m not surprised that we`re not hearing from the Southern District about what it`s doing. I mean that`s -- the common practice is not to talk about investigations while they`re ongoing. You wait until you have an indictment that you`re ready to present and then you go public.</p><p>MELBER: I don`t know. James Comey was the former SDNY chief. He talked.</p><p>ROTH: That was a very different context and it was not while he was as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York. That was --</p><p>MELBER: But the point sort of still stands.</p><p>ROTH: Yes, it does. But that doesn`t mean that that`s the best practice. It also --</p><p>MELBER: You`re not going trash James Comey today it sounds like, which is fine.</p><p>ROTH: I am not going to do that. But I do think that at some point if there is enough evidence to indict people associated with Trump and his various business entities, we`ll hear that from the Southern District.</p><p>MELBER: But let`s -- just on the campaign stuff for you and then Maya who also obviously worked there, if you`re just a normal person watching this and you`re saying hey, it`s Memorial Day, what`s going on, whatever happened with the campaign of 2016 where the lawyer for Donald Trump says \"Yes, I committed a crime for the Trump campaign and the candidate`s behalf. I admit it.\"</p><p>Now, he is in jail for three years. And whether or not you`re dealing with the issues of the presidency, which we know are complex, no one else involved in any of those payments is on the hook? I mean is SDNY done, as far as you can tell?</p><p>ROTH: I don`t have any reason to think that they are done. And there are other people who we know about already from Michael Cohen`s testimony who clearly have information about those payments, including the CFO of the Trump Organization who cosigned some of the checks, possibly Don Trump Jr.</p><p>So I wouldn`t be surprised if we hear more about the involvement if any of those individuals in those payments, as well as other people at the Trump Organization. That investigation, it would seem might be further along than the investigation of the inaugural committee, just because we know it started earlier.</p><p>It`s probably less document intensive because we`re talking about some discreet payments made to two women, maybe there is more. We don`t know that. But it looks like there is an identifiable case that should have a universe of documents and evidence that one could get one`s arms around pretty easily.</p><p>MELBER: A universe of documents. It sounds exciting.</p><p>WILEY: It`s a lawyer`s dream.</p><p>MELBER: Do you agree with that analysis or why are there no other charges on the campaign front?</p><p>WILEY: I mean I definitely agree with the analysis and we don`t know what we don`t know. I mean that`s the reality of what happens in these investigations. Unless witnesses are talking, which they can.</p><p>In this kind of case, given who the witnesses are, it would not be in their interests to talk. So, it`s not that surprising that we`re not hearing anything. Because remember, in the case of Comey, for example, he felt it was in his interests to talk. And I think that --</p><p>MELBER: You think he was covering for Comey? That that`s why he was --</p><p>WILEY: I mean I -- look, I think that`s a human thing.</p><p>MELBER: I think it`s a human thing too. I mean his book, which I read and reported on, to the end always said he was doing it for the country and to defend the FBI. He never copped to a personal motivation.</p><p>WILEY: Right. But I think he felt mistreated and that is a human thing. And when we start to see witnesses come forward, it`s often -- and talk about what they`re saying to investigators, it`s often because they feel like they`re either misunderstood or mistreated.</p><p>I think the issue here is why Robert Mueller didn`t go after Don Jr. for that Trump Tower meeting. And I wonder if that is in part because he thought it would better be handled or those kinds of matters be handled by U.S. attorneys in light of the politics.</p><p>I think the real concern here is that for the first time in his administration, Donald Trump has an attorney general he`s thrilled with and that should give us all pause.</p><p>MELBER: Right. Well, and Happy Memorial Day to you on that point. Mara, the other part here is how much the Democrats focus on this. We just discussed a lot of independent investigations, which should just proceed regardless. That`s the whole point. And if the system works, that will happen.</p><p>Then you have the congressional investigations where there is a view that the Democrats were cheering on Mueller, were looking for a political edge to this, even if they also had substantive concerns. Mueller finished. They bobbled. They didn`t have a clear reaction to whether the multiple incidents of overwhelming evidence of obstruction should be impeachable or not. That`s a choice.</p><p>And then they go on to doing other stuff. Do you think at a certain point that the Democrats risk overdoing these investigations?</p><p>GAY: No. I actually think that there is a risk on the other side that hasn`t been well enough considered. You know, first of all, there is two questions. One is what`s the right thing to do. What`s your obligation as a member of Congress? They should look at that first.</p><p>The second political question, I`m not entirely -- I don`t know the answer to, I`m not convinced that Democrats pursuing impeachment charges is political suicide. I don`t know. I haven`t seen the polls. I admit that.</p><p>But there is such a small percentage of the American population that is actually on the fence about Donald Trump. Who are these elusive voters who are still not having -- they still haven`t made up their minds?</p><p>I`m not really convinced that impeachment is suicide for Democrats. I`m really not. I think that a majority of the country thinks that there is accountability that has yet to be had for this White House.</p><p>MELBER: My special thanks to Mara Gay, Jessica Roth, and Maya Wiley. Good to see each of you.</p><p>Coming up, former Attorney General Eric Hold on THE BEAT on criminal justice reform and why he is getting so involved in redistricting.</p><p>Also, Senator Elizabeth Warren on her run for the presidency and her fight against big tech. All that, plus a special Fallback with Karamo Brown from Queer Eye.</p><p>I`m Ari Melber. You`re watching a special edition of THE BEAT right here on MSNBC.</p><p>MELBER: The Democratic presidential race has been marked by many candidates trying to go big, with bold ideas in everything from reforming Medicare to college debt to breaking up big tech as we know it. And that`s exactly where I began my recent interview with candidate and Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need real competition in This field and there`s a Problem. So Amazon, Google, they own a platform which is pretty cool, right, where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say to Amazon, in order to sell their goods.</p><p>And they don`t just compete straight up. They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies and then decide oh, I`m going after you and you, and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect. It`s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team.</p><p>My view is you can do one, be an umpire, or the other, own a team, but you don`t get to do both at the same time.</p><p>MELBER: Right. And you want to regulate so they don`t just favor themselves. You dropped this plan today. This is your first big T.V. interview about it. Let`s take a look at some of the reception today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elizabeth Warren is going after big tech companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Warren rolling out one of her big policy planks, breaking up Amazon, Google, and other big tech giants.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the toughest plan that we`ve seen today from any of the Democratic contenders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A huge shakeup in the tech sector.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s big and it`s bold and it`s going to be difficult to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could she really force this kind of breakup?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Could she really do it?</p><p>WARREN: You bet.</p><p>MELBER: What`s the answer?</p><p>WARREN: The answer is yes. But, you know, let`s be really clear about this. If you still want to be able to search for coffee pots and look at 63 choices, get the one that is going to be there in 48 hours, you can still do that as a consumer. This preserves the platform.</p><p>If you still want to go on Google and find out the capital of North Dakota, you can totally do it What this is about competition. It`s about all those little businesses and startup businesses and entrepreneurs who want to put their products on Amazon or on Google and who are at an enormous competitive disadvantage because Amazon or Google, if they like the money they see that you`re making because they get all the information, they decide to go into competition with you and put their product on page 1 and your product back on page 6 and kill your business.</p><p>MELBER: So let`s go to the way the Treasury Department is run. Because you look at it right now, I`ll draw your attention to a very simple illustration. Under Donald Trump, we can put up on the screen, you have in the red zone there, Goldman Sachs --</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: As part of Treasury Department leadership. If you go back in the Obama era, we checked and as you know, we had Goldman Sachs` former executives running Treasury then. You go back to Bush, also Goldman Sachs. You go back to Bill Clinton, also Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In a Warren administration, would there be a former Goldman Sachs executive running the Treasury Department?</p><p>WARREN: Nope.</p><p>MELBER: Is that a pledge?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Oh, that`s --</p><p>MELBER: That`s a litmus test.</p><p>WARREN: Absolutely. But let me tell you why. The problem we`ve got right now is a revolving door between Wall Street and Washington that causes everybody to be on guess for wait a minute, the next time this Treasury Secretary puts forward a proposal, is it because it really helps the economy, helps the American consumer, helps the American homeowner, or is it because it helps their former and possibly future employer?</p><p>Let`s just do for one second the Gary Cohn example, another Goldman Sachs. You remember.</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>WARREN: That`s exactly right. So Trump appoints Gary Cohn. He leaves Goldman Sachs. And Gary Cohn is going to have exactly one job, and that is to ramrod through a rewrite of the tax laws that will profoundly affect Goldman Sachs.</p><p>So what does Goldman Sachs do as Gary walks out the door? They hand him nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. It`s a gift. They don`t have to.</p><p>MELBER: Is it legal bribery?</p><p>WARREN: I think of it as a pre-bribe.</p><p>MELBER: Pre-bribe?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. So Gary then goes out, and guess what he does? He writes a tax law and manages to help ramrod it through that benefits Goldman Sachs to the tune of oh, a quarter of a billion dollars in the first go-round and that`s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>MELBER: And what you`re saying makes sense and we have such ripe targets. I think people can understand what you`re pointing to. But what does it mean for the Democratic Party if this was also how Obama and Clinton ran the Treasury. Would you be a fundamental break with that I guess is the question?</p><p>WARREN: The problem -- I have written the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate because we have a fundamental problem in Washington, and understand it`s a problem that predates Trump by decades.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>WARREN: Trump may be the most extreme example now, the pre-bribes of Gary Cohn, for example, but we have a long-standing problem and that`s the influence of money on decision making in Washington. So this bill has lots of pieces to it, including closing the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington, ending lobbying as we know it, putting a real ethics cop on THE BEAT, saying that the heads of these agencies cannot be trading in stock --</p><p>MELBER: Right. So as a political matter, are you basically writing off a bunch of Wall Street money and then today you`re writing off a bunch of Silicon Valley money?</p><p>WARREN: Maybe but this isn`t about the money. This is about how it is. We`re going to make this country work again, not just for the rich and the powerful, how we`re going make it work for everyone.</p><p>MELBER: Everyone has been talking about the rather light sentence that Paul Manafort got. When you look at that, does that reflect what you`re saying --</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: -- in Washington works well for the connected and the affluent and nobody else?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. It`s two justice systems. Look at the words carved above the United States Supreme Court. Equal justice under law.</p><p>But look at the reality. People who got buckets of money and are well connected get treated with kid gloves. Everybody else doesn`t.</p><p>MELBER: Do you think when you look at that statistically, that a similar defendant who might have been born black would have gotten a different sentence?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, we know the data on this. Of course, the sentence would have been different. In fact, study after study after study shows that for the exact same crimes, African-Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be prosecuted, to be wrongfully convicted, and to receive harsher sentences.</p><p>Race matters in our criminal justice system and it is not a system of equal justice under law.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve got a couple of one-word associations. If you can do it in word. Some of them relate to your bill.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>MELBER: Amazon.</p><p>WARREN: Can I have two words?</p><p>MELBER: Sure.</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Google?</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Facebook?</p><p>WARREN: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful. And that`s really the point of the too bigs is they`ve got too much power. And they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors, and ultimately, to change the consumer experience. We`ve got change that.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite song to work out to.</p><p>WARREN: Anything from Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Patsy Cline?</p><p>WARREN: Mm-hmm. I love Patsy Cline.</p><p>MELBER: Favorite album or artist when you were growing up?</p><p>WARREN: Any of The Beatles.</p><p>MELBER: Beatles?</p><p>WARREN: Probably the white album.</p><p>MELBER: Now, I got to know your favorite Beatle.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, no, that`s not fair. That`s like asking your favorite child, right?</p><p>MELBER: I would guess. What do I know? I don`t know you that well. I would guess Lennon. George Harrison? Boom.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Your dream running mate throughout history, living or dead, if you could pick a person that would run with you.</p><p>WARREN: Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p>MELBER: A Republican?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Because he took on the trusts?</p><p>WARREN: Because he was brave, and he took on the trusts, and he didn`t care how many people were going to be mad about it, and he did it. This is what`s amazing, it`s for the right reasons.</p><p>It wasn`t just that they were big. It wasn`t just that they were dominating the economy. It wasn`t just that they were putting farmers out of business and competitors out of business and small companies out of business.</p><p>It was that they had too much political power. And it was the very fact of that political power that caused Teddy Roosevelt to say I`m going to be a trust buster. Man, I`d like to have that guy at my side.</p><p>MELBER: There is a beloved actress who`s been talking about you, Annette Bening.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s take a look. I think we have this for you. Annette Bening says she knows she looks like Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much.</p><p>WARREN: Whoa. I`m flattered.</p><p>MELBER: Now, does she look like you or do you look like her?</p><p>WARREN: Either way. I`m totally happy with this comparison.</p><p>MELBER: You like this?</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Would you be comfortable if and when there is a Warren administration and then there is a Warren movie, would you be comfortable with her playing you?</p><p>WARREN: I`m all in.</p><p>MELBER: You`re ready for that?</p><p>WARREN: I`m ready.</p><p>MELBER: We have to ask before we let you go, how Bailey is doing. This dog is beloved on your campaign.</p><p>WARREN: This dog is the best. Between the Bailey cam and the opportunity to meet people and voters and people have been bringing him little treats. So Bailey`s filling out now for a 10-month-old dog.</p><p>MELBER: And he has his own greeting line as well as you?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, man. He does a photo line like you wouldn`t believe. And I want to be really clear about this, Ari. It is not a competition.</p><p>MELBER: No.</p><p>WARREN: I say this because I definitely do not want to be in competition with a 10-month-old golden retriever.</p><p>MELBER: I`ve seen him. I`m a dog person myself. I`m sure he could get a lot of individual donors as well if he goes in that direction.</p><p>WARREN: That`s right.</p><p>MELBER: Senator Warren, coming here on the day of your big tech announcement. We really appreciate it. We hope you`ll come back on THE BEAT.</p><p>WARREN: Good.</p><p>MELBER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: thank you.</p><p>MELBER: Coming up, a very special Fallback, Karamo Brown from Queer Eye right here. And my one-on-one interview with former Attorney General Eric Holder, his first time on THE BEAT. You`re going to see that when we`re back in just 30 seconds.</p><p>MELBER: Since leaving the Obama Justice Department, Eric Holder has focused on criminal justice reform and fighting for what he calls fair and representative elections. We talk about that and a whole lot more when we sat down for a recent and exclusive interview.</p><p>You have worked in and out of office on the issues of racism, criminal justice, and reform.</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Mm-hmm.</p><p>MELBER: We`ve talked about this before, as you have with many people. Now, let`s look at something you said to me in our 2014 interview about mistakes in that field. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLDER: We erred I think a little in the war on drugs and going too far in terms of some of the sentences. It`s time to pull back just a bit. We need to have proportionate penalties and the ability for a recognition that you can make a mistake, rehabilitate yourself, and then come back and be a productive citizen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: You called it smart on crime. We`re five years later. How far along do you think America is on those reforms? Halfway? Less than halfway?</p><p>HOLDER: Well, you know, I`d say that we should be in a much -- we should be further along than we actually are. The reality is that many of the reforms that I put in place as attorney general were dismantled by Bill -- by Sessions.</p><p>MELBER: By Jeff Sessions.</p><p>HOLDER: Yes. And that has put a real -- I think a real impediment to the progress that we should have made. Now, the first step back has certainly been passed. It is only a first step, doesn`t go nearly as far as what we did in the Obama administration.</p><p>MELBER: Can I ask something I think you may not answer. I wonder whether you look at that and you think six years you were pounding the pavement to try to get bipartisan solutions. How do you feel about it happening now?</p><p>HOLDER: Well, you know, it`s interesting because it was a bipartisan issue. I mean I remember having a meeting in my conference room where I had representatives of the Koch Brothers, the Tea Party, along with the ACLU and Center for American Progress and everybody was on the same page. And we couldn`t get Congress to do that, which was appropriate in which they have now done at least in part with regard to the first step back.</p><p>MELBER: Is that because the Republicans just didn`t want you to succeed on that?</p><p>HOLDER: A couple of things. So I think it was that. They didn`t want Obama or Holder to succeed.</p><p>And beyond that, they liked the issue of being able to say that Democrats were being, you know, soft on crime. In spite of the fact that many of their supporters were in favor of the reforms.</p><p>MELBER: I want to show you the federal incarceration rate which is dropping, as you may know, down in 2016 to a rate of 860 from 1,000 per 100,000 adults. Does that mean that there is less punishment but the racial injustices persist?</p><p>HOLDER: It certainly means that we are bringing our incarceration down and more in line with the rest of the industrialized world. Five percent of the people in the world live in the United States of America and 25 percent of all the people incarcerated around the world are incarcerated here in the United States of America.</p><p>I think we have to look at those numbers and see whether or not we are making progress on the racial front. The rate of incarceration is down. I`d have to look at some statistics and see whether or not that imbalanced -- that racial imbalance that we saw certainly in the federal system where similarly situated defendants, a black defendant would get a sense was 20 percent longer than white counterparts, see whether or not that in fact has changed.</p><p>MELBER: When you look at the cash bail system in the United States, it seems to punish the poor and minorities who are presumed as innocent as anyone else. You know the stats but I want to make sure people see African-Americans more likely to have to pay cash bail and African-American defendants tend to receive bail amounts that are 10,000 greater than white defendants. How can that still be going on in America?</p><p>HOLDER: Well then let`s start from a basic. Race is still a prime determinant in this country. We`ve not gotten to the place where we need to be when it comes to dealing with all things racial. Bobby Kennedy in 1962, I believe it was, held a conference on dealing with the bail problem. We did one 50 years later and call it a bail symposium to deal with this issue.</p><p>We here in Washington D.C. in our local system only detain people on two bases. One you`re a danger to the community or you are not likely to reappear for your next court appearance. That should be the standard not your economic ability to come up with a cash bond.</p><p>MELBER: I`m thinking about the judges who assess to Paul Manafort. And as you know, there are people who said oh, well, one of the judges was good and the other wasn`t, but both judges assessed him as this sort of courtly grandfatherly figure. Judge Jackson said that he didn`t seem likely to reoffend when Mr. Manafort had reoffended after his charges.</p><p>And I thought would any judge -- again I don`t want to single a single judge out, but would those judges be as likely to say that about a first- time young black male offender?</p><p>HOLDER: You know, I don`t want to talk about the judges -- those judges in particular, but I do worry that judges like everybody -- all other Americans carry with them implicit biases and especially in the criminal justice sphere.</p><p>MELBER: How do you fix it?</p><p>HOLDER: Well, you certainly have to have training. You have to make people aware of the fact that they do carry these biases and make them understand that you know, if you see an African-American defendant in front of you, that`s going to probably trigger things in your mind unconsciously, subconsciously, and you`re perhaps going to treat that person differently than somebody who shows up in a tie and has you know, a great lawyer that they have paid for.</p><p>You can maybe cut that person a break that you wouldn`t otherwise give to a Hispanic or African-American defendant. People have to be just aware of that. And then that training has to have to continue.</p><p>But these are the kinds of things that all of us as Americans have to deal with because we all carry this racial bag which I think the younger generation to a lesser other than people in my generation but it is still there.</p><p>MELBER: In our limited time left, I want to do redistricting. You`re taking all of this experience you have and you`re focused on redistricting. Why?</p><p>HOLDER: Redistricting happens every ten years and happened in 2021. If you care about reproductive rights, if you care about criminal justice reform, if you care about health care, if you care about protecting the right to vote, stopping voter suppression, all of those things ultimately are dependent on who is in our state legislatures.</p><p>And we have these gerrymandered state legislatures, you look at Wisconsin for instance. Democrats got 54 percent of the vote, get only 36 percent of the seats in the Wisconsin state legislature. That overly Republican Wisconsin state legislature does a whole variety of things, tries to shorten the number of days that people can vote, takes crazy positions when it comes to reproductive rights, doesn`t pass gun -- sane gun safety measures.</p><p>So if you care about those individual issues, my job is to try to make people understand that they are directly tied to redistricting.</p><p>MELBER: So to you this is bigger than any of those other policies which as you mentioned because it`s underneath all of them.</p><p>HOLDER: It`s the foundation for all of those other concerns. And it is from my perspective this whole question of making sure that everybody has the opportunity to vote and that their vote gets counted in an appropriate way. That`s the civil rights issue I believe of our time.</p><p>MELBER: There`s a lot of talk about America being a leader in -- as a \"democracy\" in the 1800s when women and African Americans couldn`t vote. What kind of democracy is that?</p><p>HOLDER: Well, that`s exactly right. That`s when I hear these things about let`s make America great again. I think of myself, well, exactly when did you think America was great? It certainly wasn`t when people were enslaved, it certainly wasn`t when women didn`t have the right to vote. It certainly wasn`t when the LGBT community was denied the rights to which it was entitled.</p><p>MELBER: Does that phrase echo as discrimination in your ears?</p><p>HOLDER: It takes us back to I think an American past that never in fact really existed in this notion of greatness. You know, America has done superb things, has done great things, and it has been a leader in you know, a whole range of things, but we`re always a work in process.</p><p>And you know, looking back, make America great again is inconsistent with who we are as Americans at our best where we look at the uncertain future, embrace it, and make it our own.</p><p>It`s very interesting hearing you put it that way. Attorney General Eric Holder, thanks for coming on THE BEAT. I love talking with you.</p><p>HOLDER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Coming up, a Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential biographer talks about whether Republican leaders may ever regret folding to Donald Trump. And later we have a very special \"FALLBACK\" with Karamo Brown from the hit show Queer Eye.</p><p>MELBER: The seemingly endless and often felonious controversies of the Trump era from the Russians, to film stars, to hush money, to tax returns, to obstruction, well, they`ve put a lot of these so-called scandals from the Obama era into perspective as The Daily Show just humorously pointed out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, HOST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Everyone is talking about the disrespectful way the president saluted a marine yesterday with his latte in his hand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Photograph without his jacket while in the Oval Office something I`ll remind you that Ronald Reagan never did.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tan suit and how the tan suit made him look unpresidential.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Whoever talked him into going into a tan suit. They`re so desperate because of these low poll numbers they`re willing to do anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Anything. Well, there`s a historian with first-hand experience of some of those Obama era double standards, Pulitzer Prize winner David Mariner. He`s the author of an acclaimed Obama biography and we just spoke about how Obama dealt with critics during his presidency and how he was shaped by struggles growing up. This is airing now for the first time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID MARANISS, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: He spent about ten years of his young adulthood trying to figure himself out not just racially, but politically, and morally, and ethically, and it was a profound internal search. And once he did that, he became somewhat of an integrated human being more than most people. And that was --</p><p>MELBER: More than most politicians or more than most human beings.</p><p>MARANISS: Well, both, actually, but certainly more than most politicians. But that was both his strongest flaw and his greatest strength because he thought if I could figure myself out, and I have all of these contradictions in my life you know, black and white and coming from Hawaii, and Indonesia, and a Kenyan father, if I can figure out all of that and put it together into an integrated personality, why can`t the politicians figure things out in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Maraniss` new book is A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father, about how his own family was targeted by anti-communist in the McCarthy era.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARANISS: You could say that McCarthy was a product of America and the fear that -- but he helped create it but he wasn`t alone just as Donald Trump isn`t alone in creating the demonization and fear of today. So they know how to take advantage of something that`s already there and that`s what they were doing both in McCarthy`s era and today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Maraniss has also talked about how he thinks the failure of some Republican leaders to confront Trump may parallel the failures of the same party denounce McCarthy in the 1950s.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARANISS: In my book, I write about a congressman from Michigan named Charles Potter who was on the House on American Activities Committee when my father was called before the committee. He made his name by being a staunch anti-communist, then he was elected to the Senate and worked with Joseph McCarthy on that Senate subcommittee when McCarthy had his fall.</p><p>It took Potter -- he finally did change, but ten years later he wrote a book called Days of Shame regretting everything that happened during that period. And one can only wonder whether it will take another ten years for Republicans to write a book like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Coming up, Queer Eye on THE BEAT. Karamo Brown is here with some major \"FALLBACK\" picks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: And now we have a very special edition of \"FALLBACK.\" I am joined by Karamo Brown, one of the Fab Five hosts on Netflix hit show Queer Eye who. He uses his background in social work and therapy to coach people through life changes. And his memoir is Karamo: My Story of Embracing Purpose, Healing, and Hope out now. Congratulations.</p><p>I`m also joined by columnist Mike Lupica, one of the most prominent sports writers in America, a member of the National Sports Media Hall of Fame. Look at him back in the day. He`s the author of -- count them up -- 15 New York Times bestsellers. It`s pretty good.</p><p>MIKE LUPICA, COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR: Purpose, Healing, and Hope. I cannot believe you stole the title of my next book.</p><p>KARAMO BROWN, T.V. HOST: I was hoping I could get one of those New York Times bestseller. Just tell me the secret.</p><p>MELBER: I thought one of the reasons you`re such a good guest is you don`t have any daily purpose so you just move like water through different television studios.</p><p>LUPICA: River runs through it. Yes, that`s my game.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, it`s very Zen. River runs through it is fly-fishing, no?</p><p>LUPICA: Well, yes.</p><p>BROWN: Yes.</p><p>LUPICA: Well, is this a quiz? No -- yes, it`s about fly-fishing and family and --</p><p>MELBER: You know why fly fishermen and women are so intense is they tie their own flies so it`s very -- it`s like an art form.</p><p>LUPICA: You know, that`s a trap.</p><p>BROWN: Can somebody get you two your own reality show because I`d watch this.</p><p>MELBER: This is what the whole segment is there for. Who needs to fall back?</p><p>KARAMO BROWN, T.V. HOST: Daytime -- daylight savings, definitely, 100 percent. I`m tired of it. It`s messing with my sleep. It`s messing with my mood. It`s messing with by my behavior. It was started for one reason, for farmers. Now we`re still doing it. We have no point of doing it. I don`t understand why. Can we stop it?</p><p>LUPICA: Who came up with this?</p><p>BROWN: Seriously.</p><p>LUPICA: Was there like one patient zero farmer who said, yes let`s have it be dark at 7:00 in the morning in the East.</p><p>MELBER: Well, isn`t this a thing where it was originally a really good idea --</p><p>BROWN: Originally.</p><p>MELBER: But now we don`t need to be outside and now it`s just antiquated.</p><p>BROWN: Yes, it`s antiquated, it`s dumb. We`re the only country that does it. It doesn`t make any sense when you go overseas in your like, our time just went back, and they`re like why? You know, we just look more and more idiotic.</p><p>MELBER: What`s on your list?</p><p>LUPICA: Well, I was -- I was thinking back to the Cohen hearings and one of the most annoying man in America is Congressman Jim Jordan from Ohio. OK, I`m a regular guy. Don`t wear a jacket. OK, we get it. OK. But these guys act like they`re the gatekeepers now for the Constitution.</p><p>I look at -- when he`s yelling and screaming at that hearing, I always try to spin ahead like a couple of hundred years and think, what will be the Hamilton of 200 years from now. Does anybody going to want to write a Hamilton about Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows? No they`re not.</p><p>MELBER: What do you think Americans who don`t follow this as closely as frankly both of you, what do Americans think when they tune in these hearings and it is just a mess and it`s so partisan and it`s so angry and in the Republican case they didn`t even seem interested in finding the facts about the current president.</p><p>BROWN: Well, I think they get to a space where they no longer are hearing each other and they`re just immune to it all. And that`s keeping us divided, it`s keeping us not really focused. Americans are not really focusing on what`s really important. And that`s why they`re not having the healthy dialogues that they need to be having because they`re like I`m hearing it, I don`t get it, I`m confused I`m just going to pick a side whoever is louder</p><p>MELBER: I want to ask you another serious question, Mike, if you`re up for it.</p><p>LUPICA: Sure.</p><p>MELBER: How does it feel to sit next to someone you know, on national television who is just dressed better, looks better, is more put-together?</p><p>LUPICA: When he walked in today, the first thought I had, I swear I was thinking this, do you have a jacket like that in a 40 shot?</p><p>MELBER: You have that thing because I looked at it -- and by the way, let me just say, I associate myself in these comments so I hope you don`t mind me talking about how good you look.</p><p>BROWN: I appreciate it. Listen, all the comments, all the compliments.</p><p>LUPICA: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MELBER: I look at this and I think I have -- I have a black jacket, I have black button-ups, I have black frame glasses but it doesn`t look like that if I put them all on together.</p><p>BROWN: Actually, it does. First of all, you both look really well, all right, so you know --</p><p>MELBER: Look all right.</p><p>BROWN: Yes, you can`t come to me with any of the self-defeating stuff. You look great, you look great, own it, love it.</p><p>LUPICA: Wait, you started with you look really well.</p><p>MELBER: You look good for you.</p><p>LUPICA: Yes. Nice -- you know, nice jacket old times.</p><p>MELBER: So is all black, black all black, is that still a good look?</p><p>BROWN: It`s always a good look. You always bet on black. Black is the best.</p><p>LUPICA: I could never carry that off in a --</p><p>BROWN: You could. I`m telling you. It`s sleek. It`s called black, black and black.</p><p>MELBER: Wasn`t it -- wasn`t it Shawn Carter who said I might wear black a year straight, I might bring back Versace shades.</p><p>BROWN: Boom.</p><p>MELBER: Boom.</p><p>LUPICA: Well, yes. I was thinking -- I was thinking more of when I thought about changing my wardrobe, I was thinking more of Pusha T, you know, you know --</p><p>BROWN: I love when you`re making hip hop references.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s hear it.</p><p>BROWN: It makes me --</p><p>MELBER: Finish it. Finish the verse.</p><p>LUPICA: We`re changing the guards, but we`re changing out the frauds. I would look like a fraud.</p><p>MELBER: Well, I think when you talk about frauds, I`m thinking Nicki Minaj. How can I be fake if my followers are real?</p><p>LUPICA: No, no, you always get the last word. I just --</p><p>MELBER: Lawrence gets the \"LAST WORD.\" I don`t need the last word. We`re done at 7:00.</p><p>LUPICA: I have one good one. You know I tried to show up with one good one, but it`s a game of horse. You end up with the last shot.</p><p>MELBER: I will say this, we love Mike Lupica.</p><p>BROWN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: He is the guy who comes to the freestyle cipher with pre-written material. He is that guy. Do you understand that?</p><p>LUPICA: Well, it`s prewritten -- well, prewritten because somebody else wrote it.</p><p>BROWN: Listen, don`t feel bad. You`re better than me. I couldn`t come over the lyric right now if you paid me.</p><p>LUPICA: Pusha T, come on.</p><p>MELBER: I love Pusha T. I love Pusha T. My fallback is a classic and I`ve been thinking about this. You ever see these commercials that are so creative you can`t even tell what they`re advertising.</p><p>LUPICA: Yes.</p><p>BROWN: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: This is one we`ll show you, I dare either of you to take a look at this. What is this ad for?</p><p>BROWN: Some high school product, women --</p><p>MELBER: Women? OK, he`s already on to it. This was the new Victoria Secret Women`s Wear. And I`m all for being creative but it`s like you can`t even tell. We got another one that is adorable so I`m -- I like it. Here, what is this ad for? This is like the whole ad. The hamster is on the whole time.</p><p>BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) maybe?</p><p>LUPICA: Mitch McConnell?</p><p>MELBER: Jeans.</p><p>BROWN: What?</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to --</p><p>LUPICA: That`s a Levi ad?</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to --</p><p>BROWN: No.</p><p>MELBER: I`m going to take a stand folks and say, and I know you were very sophisticated about this kind of stuff, maybe you can explain to us, but ads that make no sense that I can`t figure out should fall back.</p><p>BROWN: I agree with you 100 percent. That makes no sense. You`re just wasting your money there because if I`m tuning in really quickly, I don`t even -- I`m a straight man and I`m looking for women in lingerie to say maybe I want to emulate this and get my --</p><p>MELBER: Why is it got to be a straight man?</p><p>BROWN: Because I`m not buying my fiance any panties from Victoria`s Secret, sorry it`s not happening.</p><p>LUPICA: Don`t look at me.</p><p>MELBER: Mike, you can win.</p><p>LUPICA: No.</p><p>MELBER: I`m just kidding. We don`t have to make and wait. Go on.</p><p>BROWN: It is a waste of money. If I tune in, I`m going to be like what is going on here. I`ve never --</p><p>MELBER: And I get being creative but it is -- it is -- I see it more and more and this is a segment where we get to the other stuff, they`re not on new stuff. I also -- before we let you go and congratulate you on the book --</p><p>BROWN: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: I wanted to reminisce about one of my favorite moments on THE BEAT which happens to involve you. So let`s cue it up. Take a look.</p><p>BROWN: What?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I really embrace it.</p><p>MELBER: Hey, I want -- I want to hug like that too.</p><p>BROWN: You`re getting one next time I see you. Are you kidding me?</p><p>MELBER: And I`m going to hold you to the IOU on the hug.</p><p>BROWN: Anytime.</p><p>MELBER: OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BROWN: Well, it`s fresh there too. Are you ready for that hug?</p><p>MELBER: We don`t have enough hugging.</p><p>BROWN: And you`re ready for that hug.</p><p>MELBER: You did not know I was going to play that, did you?</p><p>BROWN: No, I did not know you`re going to play that.</p><p>MELBER: This is my -- this way. Get close to Mike so he`s involved.</p><p>BROWN: Come on. Come on.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LUPICA: Wait, wait, no, wait.</p><p>BROWN: This is ending toxic masculinity right here.</p><p>MELBER: And doesn`t Mike look -- he looks little.</p><p>LUPICA: I just -- I felt like a jockey in the winning circle.</p><p>MELBER: The book is My Story of Embracing Purpose, Healing, and Hope. Mr. Brown, Mr. Lupica, thanks for coming on THE BEAT.</p><p>BROWN: So glad to be here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELBER: Sometimes we have more material that we can fit in the T.V. show and we`re sharing it with you. Behind the scenes photos and videos of what may be some of your favorite guest as well as the candidates who have been running for office. Right here @THEBEATWITHARI or @ARIMELBER on Instagram, or Facebook, or Twitter, you see it right there, that`s just some of the examples. I invite you to come check it out, leave a comment and we will respond.</p><p>And that does it for us. I hope you`re enjoying your holiday weekend with family and friends. I`ll see you back here tomorrow night at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. \"HARDBALL\" with Chris Matthews is up next.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

We join you tonight at home in the midst of what is truly a strange Washington mystery that also affects potentially everyone`s national security.</p><p>We have a whistleblower, we have a foreign leader, potentially, we have the President of United States. And this has gotten really different over the last 24 hours, because of what can only be described as very serious new developments because of this whistleblower, that we`ve reported on before, who we know according to Donald Trump`s own intelligence community is credible.</p><p>And this individual is trying to send a warning basically to the Congress aka someone who can do something about this. Because of these credible concerns about Donald Trump`s behavior, not in general, not Donald Trump tweeting, not Donald Trump lying. No, Donald Trump doing things germane according to this credible whistleblower. Germane to intelligence and national security.</p><p>And there`s a lot of different reporting on this. If you`ve been watching THE BEAT you`ve seen we`ve been reporting on what Congressman Schiff has said and what print outlets have said. And what has changed lately is new reporting about the nature of this.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" is reporting the whistleblower raised concerns about a series of actions involving Trump that go beyond any quote \"single discussion\" with a foreign leader. Now NBC has not confirmed the report.</p><p>And as we`ve noted, all of our reporting on this, we are talking about a fight over an anonymous complaint. So on the one hand it`s super important to get into, on the other hand no one claims to have the physical complaint.</p><p>But \"The Washington Post\" also is contributing to our understanding, because they`ve separately reported out through their sources that this has to do with, at some level, Donald Trump making a quote \"promise to a foreign leader\", with a U.S. intelligence official saying and it`s so troubling. That it led to the complaint we`ve been covering. The formal whistleblower complaint with the intelligence services.</p><p>Another former U.S. intelligence official says, Trump`s conversation was, according to this person`s belief, a phone call. Now we don`t know who Donald Trump was talking to. As I mentioned, we don`t know what they were talking about, we don`t know whether that promise is the whole story, a part of the story or that there`s something else going on.</p><p>So what do we know? Why is this so huge? Well, we know this internal watchdog for the intelligence community, Inspector General, is part of the Trump administration. And this person who does this for a living determined the compliant was credible and urgent. And that is not just a set of words. That is the standard that then requires notification to Congress under federal law.</p><p>Then you have more mystery, more entry, because Trump`s Direct National Intelligence is then acting contrary to law to fork over the details. Now, that doesn`t mean - and I want to be fair here. That doesn`t mean that that automatically means everybody`s in on the conspiracy. It may be that something that was alleged about some people in the White House or Intel and that the intelligence Inspector General and DNI, that`s the director, are trying to figure out what to do about it.</p><p>So this goes to another layer of this sordid tale, because they then went to the Justice Department where Bill Barr has been quite the protector of the President. Now, DOJ official says, that the DOJ used their legal counsel office to review what to do. But they won`t say whether Mr. Barr, who runs it all, was personally involved.</p><p>Now the Inspector General, the man who basically said this was credible complaint went in - and this is another sign of how serious this thing that we don`t know exactly what it is is. Well, they went in and had to brief the House Intelligence Committee members in a confidential session.</p><p>Now they in that session didn`t learn the substance of the entire complaint, which of course, continues to raise what are increasingly alarming questions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): We do know that the Department of Justice has been involved in the decision to withhold that information from Congress. We do not know, because we cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: I want to bring in our experts tonight. California Congresswoman Jackie Speier who serves on that Intelligence Committee and was in the closed-door briefing today; Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and experienced diplomat; and Jason Johnson, Politics Editor for \"The Root\". Thank you all.</p><p>Congresswoman I`ve taken pains in our reporting to distinguish all that we don`t know from the little that that has come out, and understanding that you`re restricted under your obligations of what you can tell us.</p><p>So let`s start with - for viewers who are saying, \"Well, I heard something about this, which seems to be, like, it`s getting more serious.\" What can you tell us about what this is and how serious do you view it?</p><p>REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA): So the Inspector General is required under the law, when a whistleblower complaint comes in, to determine whether it`s credible and whether it`s urgent. And they - he has 14 days in which to do that. He was able to establish both that it was credible and that it was urgent.</p><p>It was then communicated to the DNI and he was within seven days supposed to make sure that the House and Senate Intelligence Committee would gain access to that information and to that complaint.</p><p>Now, the DNI did not do that, and basically it took the Inspector General some time to figure out that he wasn`t going to do that. And so it was the Inspector General who then communicated with Congressman Schiff again, as Chair of the Committee that there was this serious allegation that it was urgent.</p><p>And \"urgent\" is a really important word to focus on. Urgent means it`s impacting our national security. It is at the highest level of concern. So that is why so many of us are deeply troubled by the actions that have taken place.</p><p>MELBER: Right. Can I ask you just on that point you raised? If they blow through these deadlines under federal law, are they in violation of the law right now tonight?</p><p>SPEIER: Yes they are in violation of the law. But as we have found over and over again, the penalty is not inscribed in the law and it will take years, probably, to be able to process this through the courts to get access.</p><p>So holding in - so holding someone in contempt here - in civil contempt, in my view, is not going to be acceptable. Holding either the DNI or - and/or the Attorney General in inherent contempt is where we precisely have to go, because this is such an urgent issue.</p><p>And what is happening in front of us right now is it`s eviscerating the whistleblower protections that we have put in place throughout the executive branch and will create a chilling effect.</p><p>By virtue of going to the Attorney General what happened is, this particular whistleblower has lost all the protections that we inscribe in the whistleblower law, because the AG is saying that this doesn`t come under whistleblower protection. So I`m deeply concerned about protecting the whistleblower from reprisals.</p><p>MELBER: Well, that`s such an important point you make, because it seems like they`re building the case potentially against the person looking for the loophole, rather than doing what these laws are intended.</p><p>And ambassador, let`s be clear, we`re not talking about somebody running to \"The New York Times\" or the cameras are leaking, which this administration, but in fairness many administrations, struggled with and complained about.</p><p>This is someone who claims they saw something that Congresswoman has just detailed for us, the level of urgency. And then went through the process they`re supposed to go through. And, yet, because of the Trump administration`s actions, that process seems to be breaking down.</p><p>For your analysis, ambassador, I want to read from \"The New York Times\" on this. That \"Under the law the complaint must have the existence of an intelligence activity, violating the law, rules or regs or otherwise be mismanagement, waste abuse or danger.\" Meaning, not just \"Oh, you disagree with it or it sounds silly.\"</p><p>\"Donald Trump enjoys broad power as President to declassify intelligence secrets to order the community to act and otherwise direct the conduct of foreign policy as he sees fit.\"</p><p>What do you take as a significance of that very high bar that according to the IG, has been potentially violated?</p><p>AMB. MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: Well, two things Ari. First, the part about the whistleblower law is very important and I want to underscore that. I was the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow when Mr. Snowden arrived.</p><p>And I, many, many times on the record said we have a system in place for whistleblowers to take their complaints to higher levels. This undermines those arguments those arguments that I was making on the record what is happening right now and I hope we get that straightened out.</p><p>The second thing, I worked in the U.S. governments, at the White House. I do not understand why the DNI is talking to the Attorney General about intelligence matters. I hope we get to the bottom of that. The DNI reports to the President of the United States. And the Attorney General and Department of Justice is not an intermediary between that.</p><p>And then finally, to the point that you just said, it suggest me, and I want to keep emphasizing we`re all grabbing here at straws with a lot of holes that we do not know about, right? We`re dealing with very little--</p><p>MELBER: Straws are supposed to have two holes in fairness--</p><p>MCFAUL: Yes, OK, that`s a bad metaphor.</p><p>MELBER: We`re just listening closely ambassador.</p><p>MCFAUL: I`m not going to try another metaphor. I`m going to keep it straight, which is to say, in my understanding having worked closely with the intelligence community when I was in the government, nobody that I know would go to these steps unless there was something really serious.</p><p>This is not about the inappropriate use of classified material. It not even about policy disagreements. I`m glad you said that.</p><p>MELBER: Yes.</p><p>MCFAUL: If the President says I`m going to lift sanctions to have better relations with Putin, you and I might disagree with that. I disagree with it. But that`s his prerogative.</p><p>MELBER: It`s also out in the open.</p><p>MCFAUL: --which suggests something much bigger.</p><p>MELBER: I mean, what you are getting at ambassador, which is why we`ve gotten up to this point tonight is, that stuff and a lot of other highly objectionable unusual stuff that Donald Trump does is out in the open.</p><p>We`re talking about someone who`s at a senior enough level to have this level of access, who knows the rules and is trying to go through the whistleblower protection, who knows they could lose their job or worse.</p><p>I mean, we`re speaking in a climate where there`s still questions swirling around whether the White House tried to get a senior ex-DOJ official indicted who happened to investigate the Russia probe. That`s the climate.</p><p>So this person is looking for whistleblower protection, but still has decided, not withstanding everything Trump does in public, notwithstanding every tweet and every statement and every lie, that there`s something else so big they`re going to go - put their neck on the line here to flag this. What kind of thing could that be ambassador?</p><p>MCFAUL: Well, first, Ari, you said something really important there that I want to make sure your listeners heard. This person has to be very senior in the intelligence community. POTUS phone calls are not read out to the entire U.S. government and the entire CIA. I used to organize those phone calls for President Obama. That is a very small group of people that have access to that. So if this was a phone call, it suggests its somebody very senior.</p><p>And second I think it points to either criminal behavior - and again I`m speculating here, or some threat to a key asset to the intelligence community.</p><p>MELBER: Wow.</p><p>MCFAUL: To be so motivated to take this extraordinary act, it has to be something extraordinary, and in my mind it`s in one of those two buckets.</p><p>MELBER: Wow. Congresswoman, before I let you go, what comes next out of the Congress on this?</p><p>SPEIER: Well, we will be having a an open hearing with the Director of National Intelligence next week. But we`re going to be pursuing this with great emphasis. Because one of the things the Inspector General did to us of the 15 cases that he has referred to, the House and Senate intelligence committees, even though they didn`t meet the standards, historically that`s always been the case. They are always forwarded to us even when they do not meet the standards.</p><p>This was the one case where urgency was met. And I think the Inspector General is very anxious to try and get the Attorney General or the Director of National Intelligence to allow him to make the committees aware of what the topic is of this particular complaint.</p><p>MELBER: Understood. Congresswoman Speier, thank you so much. Ambassador McFaul, thank you. I turn now to Jason Johnson, who`s here with me.</p><p>I want a broaden now we have the national security experts and no shade. But the diplomat and the intelligence committee member know more than us.</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, THEROOT.COM, POLITICS EDITOR: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: Yes. Having excavated all of that. I want to turn to you on the political science of this and congressional executive relations. Because in a way, this is an echo of the oversight and impeachment debate, but without as much knowledge of what the underlying thing is. What do you do when you get defiance.</p><p>JOHNSON: Exactly. So that`s a very good question, Ari. Because the issue here is, look, we don`t know what this this promise was. And there`s been other reporting that says that it might just - it might include someone beyond President Trump, right?</p><p>He could have said something like, \"Hey, I promised that I can I can get you on this Committee at the United Nations.\" He could have said \"Russia, I`ll give you Alaska back.\" We don`t know what he did. But we know it was something that people thought was important enough that they had to complain about.</p><p>Here`s the issue here. We have a government that right now functions in a way where not only is William Barr operating as the personal attorney to the President of United States. He`s basically also - he is cleaner, right? He makes problems disappear.</p><p>Whenever someone has to talk to William Barr, suddenly we don`t find out as much as information. Transparency, honesty and integrity die when they go to the Department of Justice now.</p><p>So it falls upon the Oversight Committee to be as aggressive as they can. They can drag people in. They can force people to testify. If someone doesn`t want to testify, they can call the sergeant-at-arms and put them in a little jail underneath the Congress. That is the kind of behavior that we have to see from the Oversight Committee.</p><p>MELBER: Yes, and sometimes it almost sounds like resistance fan fiction when you put it that way where an episode of \"24\" or whatever tangled analogy you want to use.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>MELBER: I hit McFaul on the straw thing. But I do a lot of bad analogies myself.</p><p>JOHNSON: Its OK.</p><p>MELBER: But when you get beyond the fan fiction you actually are saying no, the record suggests that they will push as far as possible whether it`s defying the subpoena or sending Lewandowski in to act in a way that, according to reports about speaker Pelosi today, that she thought that was contemptible--</p><p>JOHNSON: Exactly.</p><p>MELBER: --and saying hold him in contempt. And what do you do then? How do you respond to that? Because they`re just seeing what they can get away with.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, and that`s the whole point, Ari. Like, I - look, I`m not part of the resistance. I`m not a Democrat. I`m just an American citizen who`s concerned about the fact that our government is basically doing whatever it wants under this administration.</p><p>Congress has power. They have both political power and they have functional power. They have an oversight constitutional responsibility. There is a reason that you can hold people in contempt. There`s a reason that there is a jail. It is to embarrass, to shame and force an administration to follow the laws that are on the books.</p><p>And at the end of the - at the end of all this, which is the most dangerous is, if this issue was considered urgent, the longer it takes before oversight gets to find out what`s really going on and who was involved, this urgent issue could become more dangerous. That`s why it`s important for Congress to be more aggressive.</p><p>MELBER: Very interesting to get you a breakdown on the politics and the congressional fight ahead. And nice to see you here on set in New York, Jason Johnson.</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p>MELBER: We`re going to fit in a 30-second break and then I have a special report coming up on the federal case that can actually stop Donald Trump`s immigrations plans in its tracks. Later tonight, Chris Hayes is here on his forum and news on Mark Zuckerberg, so we have a lot. But when we come back in 30 seconds, Berit Berger on the Bill Barr of it all.</p><p>MELBER: Developing news tonight. In this intelligence battle over Donald Trump facing a whistleblower which says there was some he did wrong. Reports that it might have been an illicit promise to a foreign leader, something so troubling that you have Donald Trump`s own intelligence Inspector General saying this is credible.</p><p>I turn now to Berit Berger, former federal prosecutor and MSNBC Analyst. Good to see you.</p><p>BERIT BERGER, FMR ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Good to see you.</p><p>MELBER: Prosecutors often side with the people run these agencies. You enforce things, you prosecute a leak, if it`s an illegal leak. But you also understand when you have someone following the rules and not leaking illegally, but using the whistleblower process. That should be respected. Walk us through your perspective of what we know and where the DOJ fits it.</p><p>BERGER: Yes, it`s incredibly surprising that we`re at this place right now, where the whistleblower process has really seemed to break down. Meaning, the normal courses was explained in your last block. You would have a whistleblower who would bring this up to their Inspector General.</p><p>But it`s important to remember the Inspector General is independent from sort of the normal chain of command in most agencies for good reason. Right? They really shouldn`t be subject to the whim of the executive of an agency, because they`re supposed to be able to investigate potential wrongdoing or miss - abuses of power.</p><p>So here you have a situation where the Inspector General has really sounded the alarm bells here saying this is not only of an urgent concern, but from a credible source. And then you have the head of the agency coming down in a very different direction, seeking DOJ probably from the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, seeking their guidance on how to potentially keep this information for Congress.</p><p>MELBER: Now what do you say to Trump officials or allies who claim, well, they went to asked for legal advice from DOJ, what`s wrong with that?</p><p>BERGER: Yes. What`s wrong with that is that here you now have DOJ, so potentially this whistleblower complaint, if we can believe what`s being reported, this whistleblower complaint potentially involves the President. Right? So now you have DOJ weighing in on a potential whistleblower complaint about the actual executive himself. So this is taking it completely out of--</p><p>MELBER: They shouldn`t get a jump on that.</p><p>BERGER: They shouldn`t get to weigh in and potentially put there thumb on the scale.</p><p>MELBER: Thumb on it. And then I got to ask you, Mr. Barr got these unusual powers, viewers may remember the Russia probe in May, that he could have authority directly from the President to declassify.</p><p>They called it a time quote \"Full and complete authority to declassify government secrets\". That was unusual. Is that suspicious in this context? In other words, why does Trump trust Barr so much more than everyone else?</p><p>BERGER: Yes. I mean, the whole thing is it`s strange. And really we keep hearing the word unprecedented, but this really is unprecedented. I mean, look, obviously the President has the ultimate declassification authority.</p><p>MELBER: Right.</p><p>BERGER: The president can choose to do classified anything he wants to. If the President truly thought there was nothing to hide in any of the conversations he had, the President like that could declassify potential phone conversations that he had, make them available to Congress.</p><p>This is not really a matter of declassifying this information. It`s a matter of getting it to Congress and why is the executive branch here trying so hard to keep it from the congressional intelligence committees.</p><p>MELBER: It`s fascinating given the DOJ being pulled into this. To get your analysis, Berit Berger, thank you as always.</p><p>BERGER: Thank you, of course.</p><p>MELBER: Really appreciated.</p><p>Up next, I have something we`ve been working on here. My special report on the federal case that can actually stop Donald Trump`s immigrations plans in its tracks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`ve probably been hearing a lot about the Flores agreement or Flores settlement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The White House said this week that they want to change the Flores agreement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: a decades-old federal court ruling known as the Flores settlement agreement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The long-standing federal courts settlement that caps how long immigration officials can hold migrant children in custody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Flores settlement agreement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The consent decree called Flores.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The exact answer is still not clear, so get used to hearing about this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The Flores agreement, this decades-old court settlement is actually more important than ever. It`s crucial understanding these immigration battles in the Trump era and legally this is the case that still governs how child migrants are treated. That`s an issue, of course, with Trump`s widely condemned family separation policy.</p><p>And right now, even if there`s all these other controversies going on, the Trump administration is methodically working to try to end that Flores ruling you were just hearing about, that`s controversial like so many things that Donald Trump does on immigration.</p><p>So we turn to a special report tonight, digging into the facts on this. With some nuances that often get lost and that are key to figuring out the right path ahead, no matter who is President. You know many human rights advocates and also former Obama officials criticized part of this Flores case.</p><p>So we want to get into this, because we all need truth to resolve some of these problems, not some kind of political cave that answers Trump`s hyperbole with a reverse echo of propaganda.</p><p>So let me tell you where this starts. The story begins in the 1980s. There was a new wave of Mexican and Central American migrants crossing into the U.S., many undocumented, and long before all of today`s talk of walls, the rhetoric and the mood from that time shows officials faced migration emergencies and strained facilities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The patrol is running out of places to keep juveniles and people to guard them. Motel rooms are being used as temporary detention centers. Private security guards have been pressed into service to keep an eye on the youths. The Patrol complains that the cost to taxpayers is astronomical.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Now those so-called youths were driving the migrant crisis. Young men, comprised many of the crossings on southern border, a shift that later involves changing demographics - more families, more children crossing in.</p><p>Now back then the ACLU and other groups sued the U.S. government for and on behalf of those minors. One of them was Jenny Flores, a 15 year old girl, fleeing violence in El Salvador who was apprehended crossing the border handcuffed and held in detention for months.</p><p>This Flores case is named after her. It began alleging that her rights were violated, like other children, because even if they crossed illegally, they still were allegedly mistreated; Subjected to illegal strip searches, forced into conditions that the U.S. is not supposed to put children in like making teenage girls share sleeping quarters with older men and allegedly holding them indefinitely.</p><p>Now on the day after that suit was filed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The attorneys held a press conference with the mother of a detained child you see he here. She had to hide her face even as she fought for these rights, because she said she was undocumented as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Public interest groups have filed suit against immigration authorities accusing them of holding 2,000 foreign children as bait for their illegal alien parents.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In many areas the center is seeing that the rights of families, the rights of children are actually being stripped away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That suit was tied up in court for years. And young immigrants were still stuck in detention a detention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A detention center for illegal aliens run by the U.S. Immigration Service, children are mixed in with adults.</p><p>The conditions here are prison-like and security is tight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was scared I would die. The army looks for young boys like me to recruit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julio`s story is typical of many children from El Salvador. He grew up in a war zone and when his uncle was killed two years ago, his parents urged him to flee to the United States. He was just 14 years old.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Those battles went on and on until 1997 when the Clinton administration settled this case that was seen as a victory for those immigrants who would get better treatment and due process that was denied to people like Jenny Flores. That includes getting food and water and medicine and toilets and sinks.</p><p>And a rule that minors can`t just be held forever, pending the resolution of their case. They had to be held in government custody in the least restrictive setting, separate from those random adults that could be dangerous.</p><p>That ruling and it`s later extensions are what Trump is fighting in court right now, and fighting in many different types of cases, including that embarrassing oral argument which recently went viral when Trump administration lawyers were trying to argue that government could deny children soap and toothbrushes. They lost and the judges ruled they lost because of the protections in this same Flores line of cases.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>A. WALLACE TASHIMA, UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE: If you don`t have a toothbrush, if you don`t have soap, if you don`t have a blanket, it`s not safe and sanitary --wouldn`t everybody agree to that? You - do you agree to that?</p><p>SARAH FABIAN, GOVERNMENT LAWYER: Well, I think it`s - I think those are - there`s fair reason to find that those things may be part of safe and sanitary-</p><p>TASHIMA: Not maybe, are?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Not maybe, so that protects how these kids are treated. But the new rules did go beyond treatment. They governed what to do with detainees were at large and things get trickier there, because this case originally applied only to children like Jenny Flores, who arrived without parents, not to everybody, not to all families.</p><p>But that would soon change with an expansion impacting everything today. That enrages President Trump. Now the shift came partly from changes that also came long before Trump and not just because of what were in the U.S.</p><p>These foreign crises that involve poverty and drugs and violence in Mexico and Central America also drove migration and that included a new influx when Obama was President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a huge humanitarian crisis on the border right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 52,000, that`s how many unaccompanied children that Department of Homeland Security says have crossed into the United States just since October.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The women and children just keep on coming.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: An estimated 5,700 unaccompanied minors will cross the border illegally, 155 a day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --President is also asking for more authority and sending border crossers back to their home country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: That influx put pressure on the U.S. and Obama responded not with any intentional way of trying to separate families, let alone denying kids so, but with tough deportation policies. Administration warned migrants they were likely to get apprehended and get sent back. And Obama himself was talking accountability.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Ultimately our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship. And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Now, here`s the thing about holding everybody accountable. That wasn`t totally fair and it was in tension with not only the bipartisan consensus, but U.S. law, which says, and this is something Trump also forgets, that even undocumented immigrants get protection if they are legitimate refugees, like fleeing abuse or human trafficking or genocide.</p><p>And just a few years before Obama was saying that President Bush had signed a unanimously passed bill that provides exactly those kind of protections, which locked in some of these rules that I`m telling you about from the Flores case.</p><p>So while Obama and Bush said they supported the rights of people fleeing that kind of abuse, some thought those protections made it too easy for them to later get absorbed in the U.S. President Obama and his administration arguing that, yes, part of what Trump officials argue now.</p><p>That when the Flores rules are too rigid, they force the government to absorb more undocumented immigrants, that`s why Obama was asking Congress for more flexibility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Part of what we`re looking in the Supplemental is some flexibility in terms of being able to preserve the due process rights of individuals who come in, but also to make sure that we`re sending a strong signal that they can`t simply show up the border and automatically assume that they`re going to be absorbed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And immigrant groups continue to go after the government in court. They said Obama`s intentions we`re not matching these rules. What happened? Do you remember? This history is really important right now. Because the government lost and the courts expanded this case to cover more people, not just unaccompanied minors, but basically all minors in detention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The United States government has been using special detention centers to hold thousands of undocumented women and children. Late Friday night a federal judge ruled they do not meet legal standards.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A federal judge ruled that Justice Department`s current system of detaining children with their mothers violates an 18 year old court settlement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And then the Obama administration did something similar to what Trump`s lawyers are doing now. They asked judges to block those rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The urgency of this case cannot be overstated because the government`s ability to address surges in illegal immigration is being significantly compromised by the District Court`s order, imposing an incorrect interpretation of a 20-year old settlement agreement that was never contemplated by the parties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Translation, what you just saw was Obama`s lawyers arguing the rules were too soft on migrants, too hard on them - on DHS. And the judges were expanding these rights in a way that rewarded undocumented immigration.</p><p>But the Obama administration lost and Appeals Court found those migrants couldn`t be held for more than 20 days, which may sound familiar, because that`s the rule that often lets families nowadays go free.</p><p>This part is super important, because this is the issue here. You have the idealistic goals, protect human rights, don`t detain people forever, which sounds fair. And then you have the practical rules, who is actually covered, how long, and what`s the ultimate remedy?</p><p>Obama was arguing the rules were tying the government`s hands and that made enforcement harder and it rewarded he argued undocumented immigrants over those who were actually following the rules. And that`s part of what the Trump administration claims today.</p><p>Doesn`t make them the same. Policy experts note something that you might be thinking of right now, that the Obama administration had more credibility, far fewer human rights allegations than the Trump folks. But it also explains why the man that Obama put in charge of border policy and this keeps coming up at the Democratic debates. That man Jeh Johnson, also criticizes these rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEH JOHNSON, FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We expanded family detention and then we ran into the issue of the Flores case, which you mentioned a moment ago. I disagreed then with the ruling in the Flores case, because I think that our Border Patrol and our immigration enforcement people need those tools available to deal with situations like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: And the man who holds Johnson`s job there, hits a similar point on Flores.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN MCALEENAN, ACTING SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: This single ruling has substantially caused and continued to fuel with current family unit crisis and the unprecedented flow of Central American families and liners illegally crossing our border until today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: So now we`re up to today in an informed way. And you might say OK, Ari, do these rulings fuel illegal immigration? Which is a big question. Now we asked experts in reporting for tonight and the answer, I`m sorry to say, boils down to \"Yes\" and \"No\".</p><p>No in the sense that, as you probably have learned as we`ve all been seeing in this coverage, macro factors driving migration. It could be war, recessions, changing a single policy is not going to reshape all immigration.</p><p>But the answer is also \"Yes\", in the sense that some migrations tied to weather, potential migrants think their journey, no matter how hard, will end up with them landing safely eventually in the U.S. And we need facts on this, not just living in a partisan or geographic bubble.</p><p>Because while many Americans, obviously aren`t following this Flores case closely over the years, it has always been huge news abroad where people follow whether it`s getting harder or easy to get to the U.S., because that could be a life and death thing.</p><p>Here`s one quick example from when this same case was expanded, this was back in 2015.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Reporter (translated): The federal Judge, Dolly Gee, ruled against the Department of Justice policy. According to the judge, the practice violates a 1997 agreement which prohibits migrant children from being detained. Gee determined that the agreement affects all minors in the custody of the federal immigration authorities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: So the word gets out. And there`s also reporting that shows some of these people who work in the so-called smuggling of migrants invoke these legal developments to recruit, including relying on protections that do exist from some of these cases.</p><p>One mother was told and she was planning to come alone, but she was told it would to be easier to stay in the U.S. if she brought her daughter with her, quote \"better with the girl\", she was told.</p><p>Now these reports don`t mean that`s the only reason people make the trip. Some Trump officials have added to the confusion by claiming without evidence the migrants are quote \"renting babies to cross the border.\" But these rules have also complicated migration.</p><p>Now if this policy history sounds a little more complex than the immigration debate, we sometimes have in this country, I think that`s partly because some people don`t know all the facts and then it`s also politically partly because Donald Trump doesn`t want you to know the facts. He wants you to be afraid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: we`re going to destroy the vile criminal cartel - they like to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly, because that way it`s more painful and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals. But when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see him thrown in rough - I said please don`t be too nice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: The ignorance also goes to the top. If you`ve been listening to this report tonight on the Flores agreement, you know that it`s named after the immigrant Jenny Flores, not the judge in the case. And that means right now on just this issue, you know a lot more than the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We`ve had some very bad court decisions. The Flores decision is a disaster. I have to tell you. Judge Flores whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country - a disaster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Whoever you may be or maybe you don`t be, because you don`t exist, because he doesn`t know why it`s called the Flores agreement.</p><p>But what do we get when we take this all together? Well, the past three administrations have clashed with the courts over immigration. They`re not the exact same. But they do overlap in arguing that these judges are making it harder to reach good policy, which is pretty striking thinking about how much they do disagree on otherwise.</p><p>And we know this is partly because Congress has not stepped up and passed comprehensive reform. Not when President Bush pitched a compromise, not when President Obama offered several ways to compromise and then acted on his own, issuing those executive orders, some of which would be narrowed by the courts. And certainly not now with President Trump offering less compromise and a lot more blunder.</p><p>But if nothing else changes, want to be clear with you, Donald Trump won`t be the last President to battle with these issues. And it`s hard to see how you get sustainable improvement unless a President and Congress modernize these rules I`ve been telling you about.</p><p>Because the facts suggest that rules designed in a different era to protect human rights, which is good, are now also contributing to sometimes rewarding rule breakers over those who come here lawfully.</p><p>And you have all this political energy around opposing Donald Trump, which is understandable, but it sometimes seems to try to disagree with anything and everything that comes out of his administration without regard to the facts, without digging into the practical complexities.</p><p>But this is important beyond the politics, because these policies impact these lives and yes sometimes deaths of real people. Many of whom, as we documented tonight, are fleeing horrors that just about, I think, anyone would try to flee - documented or not, to get safe, to take care of their kids, to pursue a better life in America.</p><p>So while the President may not know why this is even called the Flores settlement, let alone what it does, it is because of a real person, that teenager Jenny Flores, who was fighting for a better life and did something pretty remarkable. Beat the federal government in our own courts.</p><p>So when you take it together, when we get informed, America certainly owes her and everyone else something more here than the status quo. That`s our special report tonight.</p><p>But don`t go anywhere, because I want you to know my colleague MSNBC`s Chris Hayes joins me live tonight, coming up in a few minutes, to explain this \"Climate in Crisis\" series and the special interviews, that`s later in the show.</p><p>MELBER:</p><p>MELBER: Turning to some other news Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a rare appearance in DC today. He`s trying to add of his fiercest critics, meaning lawmakers. Privately he dined with some others last night. The focus is election security, privacy and of course, further regulation, potentially, of Facebook.</p><p>Now, Zuckerberg apparently called these meetings himself. He came back to Washington. This is the first time since last year when he did public testimony - 10 hours and was hit with all kinds of questions. Some pressure on Facebook has only been grown. They got that record-breaking $5 billion fine over privacy abuse. Eight attorneys general have now opened antitrust probes, questioning the company`s size and its power and its strategies.</p><p>And Elizabeth Warren, who has been surging in the Democratic primary, announced up - I should say announced her plan to break up big tech, including Facebook, on this very show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Facebook?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Too big.</p><p>MELBER: Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WARREN: Too powerful.</p><p>MELBER: Hmm.</p><p>WARREN: And that`s really the point of the two bigs. Its they`ve got too much power and they get to use that power now to dominate markets, to chew up competitors and ultimately to change the consumer experience. We got to change that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: Zuckerberg is trying to change something else, which is whether people perceive in Washington that this is a front burner priority.</p><p>Now 2020 Democrats are also out making news today, going after Trump as a climate denier. They`re speaking, it`s something we`re involved with, it`s MSNBC`s official forum on the climate crisis and they are taking questions directly from my colleague journalist Chris Hayes, who joins us live next.</p><p>MELBER: Top Democratic presidential candidates are on stage for MSNBC`s two-day forum on the climate crisis starting today. They`ve been taking questions from MSNBC`s Ali Velshi and Chris Hayes. Chris joins me right now, good evening.</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: Good evening, Ari.</p><p>MELBER: Let`s take a look at some of the answers. Here we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It`s not an issue on a list of 14 issues. We`re talking about the future of the planet. So you have got to put it at the very, very top.</p><p>ANDREW YANG (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There`s a proverb that says, \"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is now.\" We should have been doing this work 20 years ago, but the second best time is now.</p><p>SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we can`t ever do again is lose an economic argument to a climate denier, which is what happened the last time. There should never be another climate denier in the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: What jumped out at you today?</p><p>HAYES: You know, the biggest things, I think, are two things. One, is that the difference between this race and the last - the last race in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And then the last sort of wide open contestant primary that we saw back in 2008. The centrality of climate to this race is - there`s just never been anything like it from the Democratic field.</p><p>I mean, it`s not just that you have events like this and other events that have happened. It`s that it`s clearly a priority. And also that the level of depth and sophistication that any given candidate can talk about the issue with is - would not have been the case, I think, even two years ago. It certainly was not the case 10 years ago. Right?</p><p>Like, they can talk about healthcare, they can probably talk about immigration. There are certain things that a candidate knows is going to be Central and they immerse themselves in and climate is one of those issues now.</p><p>MELBER: Yes. And when you look at the 2020 race, and who is out there. Obviously, being a former Vice President gives you a level of fame, a level of influence. I`m talking, of course, Al Gore, who you`ve been able to talk to. Let`s take a look at that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Being honest with ourselves about the damage that has been done, has to be accompanied by absolute character based determination to say, \"Hell, yes, we`re going to do our best and we`re going to get started as quickly as we can and do it as well as we can.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: How is he in your view influenced this field? He`s obviously someone who also could be a power broker in a really wide open race if he wanted to be.</p><p>HAYES: It is interesting. I tried to press him and see if there was any endorsements forthcoming or at least any plans that he thought were particularly good, and he shied away from that, somewhat understandably.</p><p>Although, what I would put, he did say was what I just said. Right? He echoed the fact that he was impressed and taken by how comprehensive and how detailed all these plans are from all the candidates. How much it has been a priority.</p><p>And, I think, he`s been someone that`s been looking at this for 30 years. And his assessment of the politics right now, which is my assessment watching this as a journalist, even as a host is, the level of activation and attention right now is the best it`s ever been. And this campaign, in some ways, is a really useful vessel for driving that, but it`s more than that.</p><p>I mean, you and I are talking on the day that half of the city Houston is underwater in a weather event that`s extreme and outside the normal parameters of what they experienced, and we didn`t even see come tracking across the water like a hurricane. People see more and more every day and candidates talk about hearing on the campaign trail of just how pressing this is in people`s lives.</p><p>MELBER: We have 30 seconds, which candidates have the strongest plans?</p><p>HAYES: I don`t know. I mean, it is definitely the case that the most ambitious is Bernie Sanders plan, and I don`t even think that`s a sort of dispute. I mean, it`s a $16 trillion plan. It would be the equivalent as a percentage of GDP to something that looks like World War II mobilization.</p><p>The question about that of course is like, is that anywhere remotely in the bounds of the politically possible, particularly if Democrats were not to win the Senate. The answered that. I think, plainly and flatly is no. It`s not politically possible without a Democratic Senate. But how much of it would be in the realm politically possible even with the Democratic Senate?</p><p>MELBER: Yes, fascinating and really interesting for you to be pressing these folks for our viewers. Chris Hayes, I want to mention everyone, we can catch you on the special edition of all in \"Climate in Crisis\" with more of these newsworthy highlights. That`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC. And we have one more thing when we come back.</p><p>MELBER: Before we go, I want to share one more thing from Annie Lennox. You know her as a musician. She is also an activist. We discussed how she covered Billie Holiday`s \"Strange Fruit\", obviously. A serious song about lynchings in the deep South and how she overcame her own fear of even performing it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNIE LENNOX, SINGER-SONGWRITER: These heinous acts that we perpetrate upon each other, the human race, racism, bigotry, hatred, to me is so appalling and so shocking. And as a musician I`ve been so fortunate, because I`ve been able to be part of music making with people from all different cultures, with different colors of skin, different creeds. And I felt that it`s such a healing thing that it brings people together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MELBER: You can hear more about how she uses her work in civil rights at msnbc.com/mavericks for the full interview.</p><p>Don`t go anywhere now though. Chris Matthews is up next.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law gathered together to grill the CEOs for Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon. The nearly six-hour hearing marked the beginning of a new era that will ultimately determine how much power the federal government will deem is appropriate for Big Tech to have going forward. Indeed, power and how much is too much, was the name of the game during the testimony with a spotlight on antitrust and monopolistic behaviors.</p><p>The hearing marked the first time the companies' chief executives - Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Sundar Pinchai, and Jeff Bezos - testified live since the committee launched its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/technology/antitrust-hearing.html\">investigation of the internet</url>companies. Since then, lawmakers have collected hundreds of hours of interviews and obtained more than 1.3 million documents that included accusations of how the companies used their power to suppress competitors. It was also the first time Bezos, the richest man in the world whose <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/24/as-laid-off-workers-face-a-financial-cliff-amazons-jeff-bezos-grows-13-billion-richer-in-one-day_partner/\">personal wealth recently grew $13 billion in one day</url> during the COVID-19 pandemic, had to defend to Congress that his $1.49 trillion company isn't a monopoly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A contentious hearing</emphasis></p><p>Cisco's Webex video conference platform allowed the hearing to be conducted with the four execs testifying virtually in front of Congress members who were mostly, sometimes, wearing masks (more on that later).</p><p>Antitrust panel chairman David Cicilline's (D-RI) kicked things off at 1 p.m. ET with an emphasis on bipartisanship, which quickly unraveled when he stated the companies of the executives testifying \"have too much power\" in his opening remarks. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI), who has served in Congress for 40 years, acknowledged some issues, but countered, \"Being big is not necessarily that bad.\" Matters devolved even further when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) started the first of many temper tantrums. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he declared, wandering off topic to voice a popular complaint that Silicon Valley is silencing Republicans.</p><p>Despite the ongoing political theater, and random <url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/509651-lawmakers-clash-at-tech-antitrust-hearing-put-on-your-mask\">shouts at members about mask etiquette</url> (\"put your mask on!\"), the testimony soon began to question the execs in earnest. After about an hour into the event, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) went back and forth with Zuckerberg over internal company emails, which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/online-platforms-and-market-power/\">now been uploaded by the subcommittee</url>. In one rather revealing email, Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006322000063223.pdf\">explains</url> that acquiring companies like Instagram and Foursquare will give Facebook \"a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.\" It's this kind of evidence lawmakers will use in determining if Facebook is a monopoly or not. Zuckerberg was later questioned about threatening rivals, which he denied.</p><p>Bezos, whose opening remarks focused on his personal story, managed to stay out of questioning for the first hour, but eventually he had his time in the hot seat. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) asked him about how Amazon employees allegedly used seller data to help determine what products they should offer, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">report</url> by The Wall Street Journal. This behavior, Jayapal said, is part of what makes Amazon a monopoly that puts its marketplace sellers in a bad position.</p><p>\"You have access to data that other sellers do not have,\" Jayapal said. \"The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. . . . That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly.\"</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos countered. \"I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Over the course of the next five hours, concerns around civil rights, discrimination, if Facebook is the arbiter of truth or not, how Amazon harms small business, China, and more fringe conspiracy theories, had their time in the spotlight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis></p><p>After Wednesday's bit of interrogation, Big Tech has done its part, and now their fate - whatever that may be - rests with the antitrust subcommittee, which will examine the evidence, publish a report with the findings, and propose solutions that determine whether or not<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/29/why-we-need-to-break-up-big-tech_partner/\">Big Tech will be forced to break up</url>. </p><p>But the companies' fates don't appear decided yet. As the CEOs were compared to tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, Rep. Sensenbrenner concluded that current antitrust laws don't need to be changed. \"They've been working just fine,\" he said. \"The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Rep. Cicilline had a different stance. \"This hearing has made one fact clear to me: these companies have monopoly power,\"  he said. \"Some need to be broken up; all need to be regulated.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1596070348</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-G6Y1-JCBN-12HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law gathered together to grill the CEOs for Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon. The nearly six-hour hearing marked the beginning of a new era that will ultimately determine how much power the federal government will deem is appropriate for Big Tech to have going forward. Indeed, power and how much is too much, was the name of the game during the testimony with a spotlight on antitrust and monopolistic behaviors.</p><p>The hearing marked the first time the companies' chief executives - Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Sundar Pinchai, and Jeff Bezos - testified live since the committee launched its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/technology/antitrust-hearing.html\">investigation of the internet</url>companies. Since then, lawmakers have collected hundreds of hours of interviews and obtained more than 1.3 million documents that included accusations of how the companies used their power to suppress competitors. It was also the first time Bezos, the richest man in the world whose <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/24/as-laid-off-workers-face-a-financial-cliff-amazons-jeff-bezos-grows-13-billion-richer-in-one-day_partner/\">personal wealth recently grew $13 billion in one day</url> during the COVID-19 pandemic, had to defend to Congress that his $1.49 trillion company isn't a monopoly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A contentious hearing</emphasis></p><p>Cisco's Webex video conference platform allowed the hearing to be conducted with the four execs testifying virtually in front of Congress members who were mostly, sometimes, wearing masks (more on that later).</p><p>Antitrust panel chairman David Cicilline's (D-RI) kicked things off at 1 p.m. ET with an emphasis on bipartisanship, which quickly unraveled when he stated the companies of the executives testifying \"have too much power\" in his opening remarks. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI), who has served in Congress for 40 years, acknowledged some issues, but countered, \"Being big is not necessarily that bad.\" Matters devolved even further when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) started the first of many temper tantrums. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" he declared, wandering off topic to voice a popular complaint that Silicon Valley is silencing Republicans.</p><p>Despite the ongoing political theater, and random <url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/509651-lawmakers-clash-at-tech-antitrust-hearing-put-on-your-mask\">shouts at members about mask etiquette</url> (\"put your mask on!\"), the testimony soon began to question the execs in earnest. After about an hour into the event, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) went back and forth with Zuckerberg over internal company emails, which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/online-platforms-and-market-power/\">now been uploaded by the subcommittee</url>. In one rather revealing email, Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/0006322000063223.pdf\">explains</url> that acquiring companies like Instagram and Foursquare will give Facebook \"a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.\" It's this kind of evidence lawmakers will use in determining if Facebook is a monopoly or not. Zuckerberg was later questioned about threatening rivals, which he denied.</p><p>Bezos, whose opening remarks focused on his personal story, managed to stay out of questioning for the first hour, but eventually he had his time in the hot seat. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) asked him about how Amazon employees allegedly used seller data to help determine what products they should offer, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">report</url> by The Wall Street Journal. This behavior, Jayapal said, is part of what makes Amazon a monopoly that puts its marketplace sellers in a bad position.</p><p>\"You have access to data that other sellers do not have,\" Jayapal said. \"The whole goal of this committee's work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples, that there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive. . . . That is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly.\"</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos countered. \"I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Over the course of the next five hours, concerns around civil rights, discrimination, if Facebook is the arbiter of truth or not, how Amazon harms small business, China, and more fringe conspiracy theories, had their time in the spotlight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis></p><p>After Wednesday's bit of interrogation, Big Tech has done its part, and now their fate - whatever that may be - rests with the antitrust subcommittee, which will examine the evidence, publish a report with the findings, and propose solutions that determine whether or not<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/29/why-we-need-to-break-up-big-tech_partner/\">Big Tech will be forced to break up</url>. </p><p>But the companies' fates don't appear decided yet. As the CEOs were compared to tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, Rep. Sensenbrenner concluded that current antitrust laws don't need to be changed. \"They've been working just fine,\" he said. \"The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Rep. Cicilline had a different stance. \"This hearing has made one fact clear to me: these companies have monopoly power,\"  he said. \"Some need to be broken up; all need to be regulated.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1596118515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-HM61-DYTP-R009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

Yet they are also insidious: in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2166207-discriminating-algorithms-5-times-ai-showed-prejudice/\">amplifying biases</url>, for instance against women and minority groups, that exist in the data AI feeds on; in undermining democracy and the rule of law via the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205876-fake-news-generating-ais-could-be-the-best-weapons-to-fight-fake-news/\">automated propagation of information designed to play to prejudices</url>; in entrenching the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731640-500-how-google-and-facebook-hooked-us-and-how-to-break-the-habit/\">economic power of companies that control this technology</url>, at the expense of those whose jobs it takes.</p><p>The answers to these issues are simply stated: more research, more regulation and more agreement on where AI's boundaries should lie. The work on ways to balance AI accuracy and fairness we report on in this issue (see page 12) is a good example of how basic research can help. There are encouraging signs that big tech is finally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2221963-facebook-has-a-plan-to-tackle-fake-news-heres-why-it-wont-work/\">albeit reluctantly</url>, waking up to the idea that with the great power AI grants comes great responsibility.</p><p>The coronavirus crisis found many governments asleep at the wheel. We can't afford the same mistakes with AI</p><p>Yet the scale of the challenges involved means that, ultimately, governments and international organisations must step up to the plate. The Council of Europe, which exists to uphold democracy, human rights and the rule of law across the EU, the UK, Russia and other European countries, has already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/artificial-intelligence/home\">made a start on exploring what sensible regulatory frameworks for AI look like</url>.</p><p>More action and urgency are needed, however unfashionable global cooperation might be right now.

A trade war and Brexit. Qantas testing the effects of the world's longest flight and I got my own moment with a stunt jet team. What a year it's been. Let's go for a ride together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here we are again, the end of another year and a good moment for us to look back and take stock of some of the major events and put them into perspective, the benefit of hindsight, and perhaps, there was no single event that was more important than the relationship between the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the President of the United States. Policymakers at the Fed and executive at the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though the Fed cut rate multiple times this year, President Trump accused the Bank of holding back on economic growth. Now, speaking to me earlier in the year, the Vice Chair of the Fed, Richard Clarida said, when they get all these pressures and threats, accusations and comments, they're not fazed at all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD CLARIDA, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE: Well, let me just say this very clearly and without any equivocation, we have a very simple mandate given to us by the Congress. It's a dual mandate. Our job is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability. That is the only thing that motivates me and my colleagues.</p><p>We have a process here, it's not just us. We have Reserve Bank Presidents and I can tell you, I don't feel the pressure. The only pressure I feel is to do the best job we can to keep the economy at full employment and price stability.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Rate cuts haven't stopped the President from insulting the Fed Chair. In August, he said, \"Jerome Powell is like the golfer who can't putt.\" I gave monetary policy my best shot in our studio. The question is which club will the Fed swing as it goes out? My trusty caddy with a club or two. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Now, most of you who watch this program know my view on golf. Brings a good walk fiddling with sticks. Donald Trump wants a driver to hit a full one percent basis cut, something along the lines of -- he is not going to get it.</p><p>Instead, investors are betting far more likely on a nice chip. They're going to use a wedge and aim for a cut of 50 to 75 basis points by the end of the year with a bit of luck and a following wind.</p><p>Oh, so close. There is a chance, however, that despite presidential criticism, Chair Powell will use his putting skills with a nice short 25 percent basis points.</p><p>A couple of those wouldn't go amiss. There we go there. One, two, three. You get the idea.</p><p>[15:05:01]</p><p>QUEST: Now the Fed has a somewhat more scientific method for making decisions. Richard Clarida gave me a tour of the floor where policy is made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARIDA: I get chills every day walking in. It's a lot of history in this building, in these hallways, and as you'll see, it's pretty compact along here. The Governors are all along this corridor, so when I want to see Chair Powell or Randy Quarles or Brainard. Mickey Bowman, it's not -- I have to make an appointment or a 20-minute walk because she just walked down the hall.</p><p>QUEST: Do you -- I mean, do you really do that?</p><p>CLARIDA: Oh, yes.</p><p>QUEST: That you're popping into each other's office and sort of -- have you seen this? Or coffee for that?</p><p>CLARIDA: Certainly. Certainly, Chair Powell has walk-in privileges as do the other Governors, and we see each other a lot. We have lunch regularly.</p><p>May, I give you a little tour of the Board.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>CLARIDA: This is obviously --</p><p>QUEST: There it is.</p><p>CLARIDA: The seal.</p><p>QUEST: Wow.</p><p>CLARIDA: So Richard, this is -- this is where it all takes place eight times a year. I always wonder, how did they come up with eight? Not 12 or six, but eight times a year, so we meet.</p><p>I can come show you our chairs. We actually -- in case we forget, we actually have little labels indicating where we sit. So you'll see this is my seat and this is Chair Powell and Vice Chair Quarles and Governor Brainard and Bowman, so we all sit along this side.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, so the Governors are on this side.</p><p>CLARIDA: The Governors are on this side and then when we have meetings of the full committee, the rest of the committee members, the Reserve Bank President, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia will all sit around the table and then the rest of the room is filled with the staff.</p><p>So these are big meetings. As you'll see, it fills the room.</p><p>QUEST: And is it cut and thrust? Or is it -- I mean --</p><p>CLARIDA: Excuse me?</p><p>QUEST: Is there cut and thrust?</p><p>CLARIDA: Oh, sure. And luckily for Fed watchers, there are transcripts of the meetings released with a five-year lag, so you can go back and you -- and including sometimes attempts at humor that work and sometimes don't work.</p><p>I should say, although, you should look at these plaques, they are very interesting. This room was actually used extensively during World War II, too in order to basically -- to game plan the D-Day invasion. It was done in this room.</p><p>Read the plaque, \"The decisions reached in this room during '43 and '44 set the pattern for Allied collaboration for the successful prosecution of World War II.\"</p><p>QUEST: And all the reserve notes on the wall.</p><p>CLARIDA: And we have some reserve notes on the wall, and we have a nice big map up here to remind us of the country is divided into 12 Reserve Districts. And so that map indicates.</p><p>QUEST: Final question, so last time, accused of squeezing more out. Final question, is it more difficult for you? You used to commentate? You're an expert, an economist. Is it more -- was it difficult for you to realize that the sort of things you might have said on my program, you can no longer really just as freely say, because it will move markets.</p><p>CLARIDA: Well, that's obviously a consideration and also I try to be very careful doing any of that to distinguish between my particular view and the sense of the committee because any decision on policies of the committee decision not a Richard Clarida decision, so I try to be careful with that.</p><p>QUEST: But you can't just freelance.</p><p>CLARIDA: I try not to freelance.</p><p>QUEST: Pleasure. Thank you very much.</p><p>CLARIDA: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for showing us round. This is magnificent.</p><p>CLARIDA: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Aside from Fed policy, another great unknown this year -- Brexit. The U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U. back in March, and instead, we saw extensions, elections and plenty of shouting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I have got some advice for the Right Honorable Gentleman, look behind you.</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS: Order. Order.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: There is only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in this House, and he is on that bench.</p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY: I think that that's quite enough of the playground politics of the Conservative Party this evening.</p><p>JOHNSON: Call the election, you great big girl's blouse.</p><p>BERCOW: Don't just stipulate. Don't rant. Spare us the theatrics. Behave yourself. Be a good boy, young man.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Order. Order. When it comes to the Brexit mess, the writing is well and truly on the wall literally. One artist offered up this interpretation of Theresa May sleepwalking and falling over hurdles earlier this year, and the man behind the work can by the name Loretto. I asked him, what led him to this project.</p><p>[15:10:04]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LORETTO, GRAFFITI ARTIST: I feel so inspired about all these things that happened actually, you know, on the quality from here and other countries, United States and I think it's a lot of inspiration for artists really.</p><p>QUEST: But your art -- you're not European?</p><p>LORETTO: No.</p><p>QUEST: But you've decided that this satirical art against Brexit, what was the motivation when you feel the mood of the country?</p><p>LORETTO: It's like, I think, as an artist, we feel some chimes as inspirational how people feel.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so what are you saying about Brexit here?</p><p>LORETTO: Why do I say -- I think she need to think what people are thinking and what people are telling, because I think a leader must do sometimes what people won't expect her to do, yes, and I think --</p><p>QUEST: Are you surprised at how popular these pictures have been? I saw lots of people take them?</p><p>LORETTO: I'm so happy about it.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, it has been quite a -- people are taking pictures and when I saw you the other day, people coming up and talking to you.</p><p>LORETTO: Yes, I like that.</p><p>QUEST: What are they saying about it? What are they saying?</p><p>LORETTO: They like the artworks. They like the meaning. They like the color because I want also to create something beautiful about maybe a higher moment. Yes. Because this is all about life, right? Through her moments, we can create something good, you know.</p><p>And give some sort of message, yes, and also, in another hand to do like a comedy about like a comedian.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Well, Britain didn't manage to leave the E.U. this year. I did manage to leave Britain and went all the way to Australia on the longest flight the world.</p><p>QUEST: 2019 was such a busy year in one's travels. Airports, trains, journeys galore. And I have the passport stamps to prove it. All told, I was in London for some 20 trips with Brexit this and Brexit that. I've been to Finland, twice, Helsinki. And the capital of Christmas, Rovaniemi, where it's all about Santa Claus.</p><p>Marrakech with the camels. Hawaii with the tropical drinks and a summer rest about the Queen Mary 2. There were elephants in Sri Lanka and of course, a quilt in Edinburg.</p><p>But as you and I know, travel isn't there any catching a bit there and the destination, it's about the journey, too. Qantas designed Project Sunrise to be the world's longest flight from London to Sydney. Now, this was the expectation.</p><p>[15:15:05]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Imagine sitting here for 19 straight hours. Qantas wants to see how people handle the world's longest routes and it is running test flights before -- do you have to? That's disgusting.</p><p>Commercial -- this isn't much better. Commercial services, it's all in aid of Project Sunrise. Get me out of here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, Project Sunrise is turning more and more towards reality. And the reality is more spacious, though no less trying. From the science of our sleep to a rare double sunrise. The flight was as much an experiment as it was an experience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): 4:30 in the morning when check-in begins.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you checking any baggage in?</p><p>QUEST (voice over): For QS 7879, the flight from London to Sydney.</p><p>QUEST: Good morning.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): We lift off before dawn and head east and our first sunrise on this double sunrise flight. It's a rare aviation event for the same flight to see two sunrises across different days. Even the Qantas CEO takes time to capture the moment.</p><p>This flight is all about research for both crew and passengers. Learning how our bodies handle long ultra-long haul.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This really gives us a good indication of their sleep behavior at different times.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): That means exercise. Luckily, the plane is empty.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): This flight is an airline CEO's nightmare. Rows and rows of empty seats. They have to be empty. If they were filled with passengers, we would never get to Sydney.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The flight is also about research with the pilots and their brain patterns. Qantas will need to convince regulators to allow pilots to be on duty for up to 24 hours.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm wearing an EEG monitor. This one will measure the alertness level while I'm sitting in the flight deck operating. I'll switch to a different one for night.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Our first meal is crafted to promote sleep.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the way we've designed the menu is to really support the sleep cycles and the wake cycles throughout the flight. We've got the high GI bread, and we're pairing that with dishes that have good quality for example, and that helps to encourage the production of serotonin and melatonin.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Halfway there and over China, some are sleeping, others or not, I'm just enjoying the experience.</p><p>Our second sunrise comes as we pass the Philippines. It's thought less than a thousand passengers in total have experienced the double sunrise.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): We're flying over the South China Sea and we've been airborne for some 12 hours, and we still have the equivalent of London to New York to do.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Qantas has put a lot of money and effort into ultra- long haul research far more than other airlines who have similar routes.</p><p>Alan Joyce explains why.</p><p>ALAN JOYCE, CEO, QANTAS: You can't do the type of studying that we're doing on regular flights. The pilot has got to be wearing headgear. They've got to be testing you and I and you can't do that regular flights that you can do on these delivery flights.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Before long, we're on final approach. This flight has got much faster than I expected. Not exactly sure what I've done for all these hours. We landed in Sydney.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations on that flight.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Now, we've broken the record. Yes, we've made history.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): So it looks like we've done it. The longest flight in the world in both time at about 19 hours 19 minutes and distance, well over 10,000 miles. Two records, one flight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Flying takes a toll on the environment that much we are well aware. And 2019 saw calls to de-incentivize frequent flying, and a new willingness from airlines to tackle environmental issues.</p><p>Qantas' Chief Executive Alan Joyce told me he is aware there's a problem and said his airline is working to fix it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You're going carbon neutral by 2050. Aviation airlines, you are the whipping boy now in the environmental debate.</p><p>JOYCE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that's unfair?</p><p>JOYCE: Well, you know, I think you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. You know, the positives of aviation that it has generated for the world. It gets people to understand different communities, different cultures, it gets people to visit family and friends. It promotes business. It promotes economic activity, and we are conscious that a large part of our communities now are uncomfortable with traveling.</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>JOYCE: We need to fix that, and what airlines have to do like we have is commit that we will get to net carbon neutral by 2050. That we give people the ability to offset our carbon emissions; that we do develop sustainable aviation fuel, which is what we're doing. Because you cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think though -- I find with carbon offsetting schemes, I always -- when I say it's not -- it's a scam. But I always wonder where the money goes? Who audits it? And it almost seems like a jolly good idea, but I'm not sure it works.</p><p>JOYCE: So the schemes that we have, and we've got one of the biggest schemes in the world, 10 percent of our customers on qantas.com offset the carbon emissions. They are certified by the Australian government. They have to deliver a benefit that that is certified, so it goes through a very rigorous process that we audit, that the government audits and with that --</p><p>QUEST: But it is still seen as a do-gooder thing. You know, you tick the box, whatever, but if you ask most business travelers, they don't do it.</p><p>JOYCE: So I'll tell you what? A lot of our corporate accounts are now doing it as part of their dealing with Qantas and all of Qantas's duty travel are offset against carbon emissions.</p><p>QUEST: Carbon neutral by 2050. Can you not do it sooner?</p><p>JOYCE: So no, I think to get there, you're going to need to develop a sustainable aviation fuel, and to get that to be an economic alternative is going to take a number of years, I think to get there. And it's going to need new technology.</p><p>We're replacing all the 747s by the end of next year. But the new technology, a new aircraft is going to be key in also helping get there. Can I say also for people that are having a view on carbon offsetting, isn't it better to do that than nothing?</p><p>And I would encourage people, really to offset our carbons, we do as I said, I try and encourage as many of our customers to do it because it is better to contribute back to the environment by offsetting your carbon emissions in projects that I can see having a big benefit to the environment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: One startup has the solution to going green when you get off the plane. It's one small hop for man, one giant leap for the planet. Yes, it's pogo sticks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, well done. Genius are hopping mad. The Swedish startup Cangoroo is launching a pogo stick rental service from San Francisco to Paris.</p><p>Now, it is the alternative to the one that I've been using, which is highly preferable -- where am I going? Just bear with me one moment, I promise you I will return. Yes, it's highly good, and we've done this one before.</p><p>But why would you forsake this to go with this? Right. How realistic all of it? Smart pogo sticks count your jumps. It also has a GPS to keep you bouncing the right way. It'll cost $1.00 to unlock 30 cents per minute. It's not allowed on the highways and indeed in the studios and we will probably all be fired.</p><p>Adam Mikkelsen is the CEO and cofounder of Cangoroo. He joins me from Malmo, Sweden via Skype. You can't be serious about this?</p><p>ADAM MIKKELSEN, CEO AND COFOUNDER, CANGOROO: Well, in fact we are. And like thinking about it, like we don't see that we're actually going to compete with the e-scooters per se, but what we do see is that having pogo sticks in the city especially by, you know, city parks and boardwalks and stuff like that people could, you know, have fun and they could, you know, get some well needed workouts into their daily routine. So we've got a demand for it.</p><p>QUEST: So where did the idea come from? Because it's not the sort of thing you wake up on an average Tuesday and think, you know, I think I'm going to bring out the pogo stick.</p><p>MIKKELSEN: Yes, so basically with a background in branding and marketing, we run an advertising agency as well. So we've been following the micromobility industry for quite a while, and what we saw was basically that all of today's players are quite generic in the industry.</p><p>So we -- basically, we saw an opening for a brand to launch that are actually kind of putting brand first. And you know, naturally, the pogo sticks won't be our only product, but we definitely see that as our main product.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And the man who promised to do whatever it takes to save the euro has stepped down. Now, there's a new head of the European Central Bank.</p><p>[15:25:46]</p><p>QUEST: He 2019 brought changes at the top of some of the world's most important financial institutions. For instance, Christine Lagarde left the IMF to join the European Central Bank replacing Mario Draghi.</p><p>Anna Stewart looks back at the man known as Super Mario.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice over): He is known as Super Mario, the man who saved the Eurozone.</p><p>He became head of European Central Bank in the middle of the European debt crisis. Europe had already bailed out Ireland, Portugal and Greece and anti-austerity protests were sweeping across the continent. Markets were in turmoil. Politicians were worried about the breakup of the Eurozone.</p><p>Then in July 2012, Mario Draghi said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIO DRAGHI, FORMER HEAD OF EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK: The ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): It wasn't even an official ECB meeting, but that speech defined Draghi's legacy. Three words, whatever it takes. It was enough to calm investors' nerves, the Eurozone survived.</p><p>And although Draghi backed up his words with action, an emergency bond buying program with OMT, it was never needed. In his eight years as ECB President, Draghi never raised interest rates.</p><p>In fact he took rates into negative territory. He also has a store of controversial program of stimulus buying nearly $3 trillion of Eurozone assets. One press conference stands out in Draghi's career.</p><p>In 2015, a feminist activist made a surprise appearance. She showers him confetti while yelling, \"End the ECB dictatorship.\" As soon as she was removed, Draghi coolly returned to his statement.</p><p>It wasn't just what he said but what he wore that drew the attention of the financial world. Some claiming the color of his tie indicated his stance on monetary policy, the methodology diligently pursued by French bank, Credit Agricole, only be found completely lacking of any real correlation.</p><p>No doubt his successor, Christine Lagarde will undergo similar scrutiny, perhaps on the color of her scarves.</p><p>Draghi enjoyed the job, despite the enormous pressures it presented.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DRAGHI: It was originally an obligation, then it became a welcome obligation, and then even a pleasure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): Meanwhile, journalists wanted forward guidance on his next career move. His answer --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DRAGHI: But if you want more information, just ask my wife.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): Anna Stewart, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Christine Lagarde says she trusts Mario Draghi has done the right thing. Some of Draghi's colleagues disagreed with his whatever it takes redux and resigned. That means Christine Lagarde is walking into a bank that's divided on the future of stimulus.</p><p>At the IMF Headquarters in Washington, she told me dissent is healthy and even necessary, up to a point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, THEN OUTGOING MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF: You know, it's -- I think it is good that there are different opinions. And if it was unanimity consensus, there would be none of that debate which is so necessary and productive because who has the ultimate gospel on economics? On monetary policies? There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of questioning going on at the moment.</p><p>What actually works? What doesn't work? What are the good transmission channels? So I think to have the debate is very healthy and very good and there should be room for dissent.</p><p>I think what I'm most concerned about, and it's been my life and my DNA is to bring people together and once the decision is made to actually live with it and speak to it. Because it's been the decision of the group.</p><p>QUEST: Is that even possible at something like the ECB?</p><p>LAGARDE: We'll see. We'll see. As I said, debate, dissent, arguments -- all of that is necessary and it's healthy. Once the decision is made, there should be a landscape where we're all in it together and we'll move forward.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, we have to always come back to fixing the roof while the sun shines.</p><p>[15:30:03]</p><p>QUEST: You've done a lot of work on structural reform here at the Fund, but countries have done nowhere near enough. It's even worse in Europe, where a certain element of structural reform has been done. But the move towards that single digital market, all the other things that the ECB has been calling for are still -- do you have great hopes for success?</p><p>LAGARDE: I will certainly advocate and do my part in order to help deeper and better structural reforms to just unleash the potential of Europeans' enterprises, households, entrepreneurs, because there is a richness there that in many instances is restricted or refrained by too much bureaucracy, not enough mobility, not enough flexibility and fluidity, so I will do the best I can in my field.</p><p>QUEST: But now you're really going to be tested, aren't you? Because you're going into an economic field, and really what this job now requires is not a PhD or an economist, it requires somebody who can pull this whole thing together, isn't it? Who can keep this train on the tracks?</p><p>LAGARDE: Yes, keep the train on tracks and drive the monetary bus in the direction of stability and cohesion, and I will do the best I can to do that job.</p><p>QUEST: Do you worry that you can be bamboozled by the economists?</p><p>LAGARDE: They've always tried to do that with me. You know, when I joined as Minister of Finance, they all said at the time, she's a lawyer. Well, I can listen, I can absorb. I've eaten a lot of files and tried to understand a lot of concepts. I don't master them, and I'll never be a PhD in Economics, let alone macro, you know, macroeconomics or econometrics.</p><p>I've had it at the IMF as well. You know, it's a fantastic institution, which is largely dominated by economists. They probably all thought at the time, she's a lawyer. She was a Finance Minister for a little while, but she is just a lawyer.</p><p>Well, again, I can listen. I can absorb. I can learn from everybody. I'm sure the same thing will happen to me at the ECB, we'll see.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: We couldn't let Madam Lagarde go to Frankfurt empty handed and for luck, we couldn't open our present inside, so we went to the roof of the IMF.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You constantly say fix the roof while the sun shines.</p><p>LAGARDE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Where you are going, it's not bad.</p><p>LAGARDE: It's so bad. It's not raining. You're right. But the sun is not really shining either, yet.</p><p>QUEST: And where you're going, arguably, there are more rain showers. Arguably, a lot more rain showers in Frankfurt, ECB, Eurozone, Brexit -- so we figured you'd need this. We figured you need this. It is your own umbrella, but despite the fact it is dark outside in your world, it is always sunny.</p><p>LAGARDE: Being optimistic has a lot to do with inspiring confidence. And that's what we are very short of at the moment. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>LAGARDE: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Bill Campbell was one of the most influential players in Silicon Valley, and most of us never even knew who he was. He coached the biggest bosses in high tech and big tech, from Bill Gates, to Steve Jobs to Eric Schmidt, and two fellow Alphabet alums who wrote a book on just how and why Campbell was so effective.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You've all had mentors. You've had mentors. You've had professional mentors. You've had people who have guided you? What was the difference here?</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS, GOOGLE: You know, it's both very difficult and very simple. A lot of the things that Bill did, any of us can do as managers and leaders. You know, it starts with being a good manager running a tight ship. Second, building trust and really listening to people, really having their back.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ALPHABET: But almost everybody I know, the first reaction they have is, I don't need a coach. By the way, that was my reaction. That was his reaction.</p><p>JONATHAN ROSENBERG, ADVISOR, ALPHABET: It was my reaction, too.</p><p>SCHMIDT: We don't need coaches.</p><p>QUEST: So what would you say to me, if I say to you, I don't need a coach if I work for you. What would you say?</p><p>SCHMIDT: I'd say, do tennis players have coaches?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Yes. And the tennis players are better than the coaches, aren't they? And still they have coaches. Maybe coaching is different than doing --</p><p>ROSENBERG: Is every one of your shows terrific?</p><p>QUEST: Oh, that's a very nasty question. I'll thank you not to go there.</p><p>ROSENBERG: What Bill would do if he were here, he would have told you that you're the best host in the industry. And then one day when you had a show that wasn't so good, he'd say, you know, you weren't your best today.</p><p>You're much more likely to listen to somebody who behaves that way.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Notice he didn't say that you did a bad job. He said you could have done better and then you yourself, make yourself better. That's what coaching is.</p><p>Coaching is letting you see where you can be and getting you then --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: After the break, as \"Top Gun\" makes a comeback, I underwent a stomach churning, acrobatic jet experience. I was inverted and tossed around the skies. I need to sit down.</p><p>[15:37:48]</p><p>QUEST: It is time to open up the presents. Maybe a model plane if you're lucky. The Breitling Jet Team gave me a truly tremendous gift earlier this year, my very own \"Top Gun\" moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): This is not your typical flight where you ensure your seatbelt is fastened --</p><p>Seven thousand feet above ground, and the Breitling Jet Team, it's a battle of lumps.</p><p>It all began in such an orderly fashion. Excitement overflowing in the room.</p><p>GEORGE KERN, CEO, BREITLING: So Richard would be in position number three and we will have a fantastic view on the whole jet -- the seven jets. It's frightening, but I'm sure he will enjoy it.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): For this sort of flight, preparation is everything.</p><p>KERN: This one. You have to wear this one. This is your size.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): You can't fly if you're not dressed properly.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Perfectly comfortable.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Like any other flight. Here, there is a safety briefing. But this one involves ejector seats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go.</p><p>QUEST: And so into the air where everything changed. I was fine for the first loop. The barrel roll had me in stitches.</p><p>[15:40:10]</p><p>QUEST (voice over): And then, the second loop. (INAUDIBLE) requires you wear a veil over the rest.</p><p>Back on the ground, I can reflect the pilot's skills, the plane's performance, the excellence of the experience. I feel elated. Let's be honest though, I won't be doing this again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: In a year of acrimony over impeachment and Brexit, there was one feel good moment that took place in July, the world celebrated one of mankind's greatest achievements -- 50 years since this moment.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>QUEST: That that was the result of course of years of effort, setbacks, sacrifice. Sir Richard Branson told me how the moon landing half a century ago prompted him to start his own space company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD BRANSON, FOUNDER, VIRGIN GALACTIC: I think if Neil and Buzz had not landed on the moon, we wouldn't be running Virgin Galactic, our space company and I suspect Elon and Jeff wouldn't have been running theirs.</p><p>So it was for me, it was what inspired me to ultimately start Virgin Galactic and get people into space.</p><p>QUEST: You were 19 when the event happened, and I'm guessing you remember it very well.</p><p>BRANSON: I was sitting in front of a tiny black and white TV set. There was only one channel in those days, BBC and with my family, my sisters, we were all huddled around the TV in our pajamas, watching, you know, the most extraordinary event and it was just one of those things -- I mean, maybe the only one in my lifetime, there was nothing but good attached to it.</p><p>And you had all the best scientists in the world getting together to make it happen. The last time we have had with America who got together to make something happen, it was the nuclear bombs, so how lovely that we had something that the whole world could embrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now in October, his company, Virgin Galactic boldly went where no space company has gone before -- a public listing. Sir Richard told us it's all part of his quest to get Virgin Galactic moving faster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRANSON: What's exciting is the public can now invest in a spaceship company, they've never been able to do that before. They can invest in the best spaceship company, there is -- Virgin Galactic.</p><p>And we've managed to get the resources from this flow for Virgin Galactic to expand rapidly the number of spaceships we've got. And the advantage of expanding the amount of spaceships we've got rapidly is that we'll be able to start bringing the price down in the years to come. So, you know, it's great -- it's great to be able to prove that we have built a company that the public love and the institutions love and it's so far so good.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: When I look at this spaceship, I mean, it looks like an airplane. I know that you guys do have an ambition to get into hypersonic travel as well, which is, I mean, it will help someone like me who's always in the air. But how quickly can that happen?</p><p>GEORGE WHITESIDES, CEO, VIRGIN GALAGTIC: Well, I think what's exciting is that when we are operating commercially, and we've already done this in test flight is we're going to be the only company that's bringing people on a winged vehicle at Mach 3-plus speeds, right? So that's really tremendous, right? That's a huge thing.</p><p>And we're going to be developing, you know, a ton of data that will help us design future vehicles, and that's going to come --</p><p>GIOKOS: Is that under process already?</p><p>WHITSIDES: Yes, it is already in the process. And so -- and so, you know, we recently had this great investment from Boeing, you know, which put a bit of money into the company and that closed along with this deal, and we're going to work with them to think about high speed mobility solutions, right?</p><p>How do we get people from one place to another, you know, much faster on the Earth's surface? And so we don't know where that journey will exactly lead in terms of what the exact design will be. But I think it's an exciting pathway and it is like you say, it is a huge market for --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, I know</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Throughout the year, we watched Beyond Meat and its share price. It seems to be the gift that kept on giving. It was one of the best performing IPOs of the year. That was then, this is now. We'll take a look at how the fake meat performed against the real thing. We had a full throttle taste test.</p><p>[15:46:58]</p><p>QUEST: I love the holiday season, all the treats, cookies for me, a biscuit or two and carrot for Rudolph. The year was the year of fake meat. Beyond Meat stocks skyrocketed. Its rival Impossible Foods said it had no plans to follow suit and go public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID LEE, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, IMPOSSIBLE FOODS: Well, investors look at $1.5 trillion meat and dairy market globally and they're recognizing the meat eaters and we see this every day, consumers of the Impossible Whopper are saying you know what, we want something better. And that's a huge opportunity for the business as well as the mission to make the world a better place.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, but the -- you must have been greatly fortified when you saw the way Beyond Meat did? Rocket on the market.</p><p>LEE: We were extremely pleased for them and for anyone who seeks to serve the mission we have.</p><p>QUEST: But you don't intend to stay private forever, do you? Shouldn't you be turning those yet?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just a couple more seconds and we'll get into that. You'll see that you'll sear, it's just like beef.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, it is. It is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The visual cues are exactly the same. It responds the same and you can use it for much more than a burger.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, meatballs, meatloaf, lasagna, tacos -- you name it. Anything that you can do with the ground meat.</p><p>LEE: Dumplings in Hong Kong. It's in Korean food in Macau. It performs like beef, it transforms though it is plant based.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So back to your financials.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Mr. Lee, you're a private company. You don't have to reveal, but you are going to have to reveal at some point. When -- let's just go straight -- a simple question. When do you hope to IPO? If only because your investors will wish to realize and have an avenue out?</p><p>LEE: We have to give our investors great return. There is no question. But that does not presuppose that we have to IPO.</p><p>QUEST: You are in -- and are you in competition with Beyond Meat? You sort of have an amalgam of overlap in the restaurant business, but they are meat to consumer, you are meat to the industry.</p><p>LEE: I think that our competition for Impossible Foods is not Beyond Meat. We don't compete really for capital. We don't compete for share of stomach. Our consumer is the meat eater. Our true competition for the meat eater is what they're choosing to eat today from an animal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: I then had dinner with Guru La Monica where we put the fake meat to a real test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Do you think this is the future? I will wait until you finish. What did it taste like first?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: There's a lot of ketchup on here so I taste the ketchup. No, I've never had the Beyond Meat burger before. I will admit I like the Impossible better. I've had the Impossible burger several times, including at the now defunct corporate cafe in this building.</p><p>But as a person who does not feel any reason to stop eating meat, I will enjoy a meatless, plant-based burger every now and then I don't feel like I'm missing all that much.</p><p>QUEST: All right, try the -- that was the Beyond. Try the Impossible.</p><p>LA MONICA: Try the Impossible.</p><p>QUEST: Which sort of looks a little more meaty.</p><p>LA MONICA: I like the fact that it has that texture and the red meat sort of feel to it.</p><p>QUEST: But they are not IPO-ing yet, are they? At some point they will, no doubt?</p><p>LA MONICA: I would have to think they will especially as I talk with my mouth full, I hope my mother is not watching or my wife for that matter. I think that Impossible will eventually need to go public in order to stay competitive with Beyond.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>And also, Richard, the key thing is Beyond Meat -- Impossible does not have a retail presence yet. That's something they're working on.</p><p>I'm looking forward to the day where I can buy one of these and make it at home. You can't do that yet. I think an IPO will help them in that regard.</p><p>QUEST: Now, this is the meat one. The real meat. Can you tell the difference? Can you tell the difference?</p><p>LA MONICA: I can actually. There's something about the texture. It's juicier. I think that Beyond Meat and Impossible have done an admirable job of mimicking the mouth-feel for lack of a better word -- has that ever been used on CNNI before -- of real beef, but there is no substitute for a real meat burger in my --</p><p>QUEST: But if I'm playing with my food that's what --</p><p>LA MONICA: You shouldn't do that, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I know, but --</p><p>LA MONICA: The dad in me says you should not.</p><p>QUEST: That's what the three of them look like. Now can you tell which is which just from that? Can you tell because it gets to the point where you really can't, but does it really matter? Who is going to be the winner in this?</p><p>LA MONICA: Beef versus plant based or Impossible versus Beyond Meat?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: I mean, I think that clearly, clearly, I think that both of these companies have done a good job of catering to people like us who want to eat a real beef burger, but occasionally have the plant-based, healthier non-meat solution as well.</p><p>But I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to Shake Shack anytime soon and try and ask for a meatless burger if they have one.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Well, it was very kind of you to join me for dinner. I have to dash, and you'll take care of the check. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, which one? Which one? Decisions. Decisions. Still to come. Old shows become new media. The fight for content breaks out across the streaming landscape. Oh, I can't have that one.</p><p>QUEST: The Holiday times is for lazing on the couch and Clare and I are cozy here on the couch from \"Friends,\" not our favorite Christmas shows and movies. But this year it's going to be a lot more complicated when it comes to deciding what to watch.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Richard. This year, there's a slew of streaming services. In Christmas past, of course, we have Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now, Christmas present -- we can add in Disney Plus and Apple Plus and by Christmas future, we will have Peacock, HBO Max and BritBox which announced their launch this year.</p><p>QUEST: Except they're all still fighting over content and content these days is about good old fashioned programs, and shows like \"Friends.\"</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Exactly. \"Friends,\" 236 episodes, 10 seasons still on Netflix, but not for long because it's moving to HBO Max next year. It's a sitcom, but it's also a streaming staple, Richard, and big brands have been cashing in on its nostalgic revival.</p><p>QUEST: Turn up the telly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): From product placement --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This wonder broom is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): To memorabilia and even haircuts, \"Friends\" has always been a brand that sells.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): And 25 years on that hasn't changed. It's still not enough of you as just to watch the show. They want to live in the world of Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Phoebe and Joey and that means eating their food, sitting on their couch and of course, drinking their coffee.</p><p>And businesses are taking advantage. Coffee chain, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf jumped at the chance of a tie up for the anniversary launching a special edition range of coffee specialty drinks and memorabilia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRIN KELLARIS, VP MARKETING, COFFEE BEANS AND TEA LEAF: Our \"Friends\" themed coffee mugs we pre-released and actually sold out in about three hours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): They also hosted two pop up Central Perk events in Los Angeles in August.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLARIS: Those two locations we saw significant spikes in foot traffic, but more importantly as a business it really bolstered system wide sales.</p><p>RACHEL GREEN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): \"Pottery Barn\" also brought back the famous apothecary table which despite its thousand dollar price tag is a top seller in its department, the company says, it must be the antique properties.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHOEBE BUFFAY, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: You can almost smell the opium.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Even Lego is getting in on the action with a $60.00 replica of Central Perk. Lego says it's one of its fastest selling sets ever.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): Now, of course, none of these promotions would work nearly as well if \"Friends\" hadn't experienced a revival in the age of streaming. Last year, it was Netflix's second most watched show and the company reportedly paid around $100 million to keep the rights to the show for one more year before it goes on a break, moving to Warner Media's HBO Max streaming service in 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, EQUITY ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: It's an iconic show and ultimately it's really one of the crown jewels of streaming.

This is CNN NEWS NOW. At this hour, the Likud Party members of voting in their leadership contest in Israel. Knesset member, Gideon Sa'ar has put up a tough challenge. Of course longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still favored to win his party's leadership role.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winner will run in March's General Election. The results are expected later on Thursday in the leadership contest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russia's most outspoken opposition leader Alexei Navalny says one of his employees was kidnapped from his apartment and sent to a remote military base in the Arctic. The man works in Navalny's army anti-corruption foundation. It was raided earlier today amid the Russian government's yearend crackdown on critics.</p><p>The U.S. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski is openly criticizing the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for coordinating with the White House ahead of President Trump's impeachment trial.

The storm left widespread damage, destroyed houses and knocked down trees and power lines, internet and phone services have also been disrupted. Reportedly, they have not been fully restored.</p><p>You're up-to-date with CNN NEWS NOW. Stay tuned as I look back. It is the best of QUEST.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE AND FEMALE: Five, four, three, two, one.</p><p>QUEST: Wall Street -- all lit up for Christmas, as we come to the end of an extremely busy year. A trade war and Brexit. Qantas testing the effects of the world's longest flight and I got my own moment with a stunt jet team. What a year it's been. Let's go for a ride together.</p><p>Here we are again, the end of another year and a good moment for us to look back and take stock of some of the major events and put them into perspective, the benefit of hindsight, and perhaps, there was no single event that was more important than the relationship between the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the President of the United States. Policymakers at the Fed and executive at the White House.</p><p>Even though the Fed cut rate multiple times this year, President Trump accused the Bank of holding back on economic growth. Now, speaking to me earlier in the year, the Vice Chair of the Fed, Richard Clarida said, when they get all these pressures and threats, accusations and comments, they're not fazed at all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD CLARIDA, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE: Well, let me just say this very clearly and without any equivocation, we have a very simple mandate given to us by the Congress. It's a dual mandate. Our job is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability. That is the only thing that motivates me and my colleagues.</p><p>We have a process here, it's not just us. We have Reserve Bank Presidents and I can tell you, I don't feel the pressure. The only pressure I feel is to do the best job we can to keep the economy at full employment and price stability.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Rate cuts haven't stopped the President from insulting the Fed Chair. In August, he said, \"Jerome Powell is like the golfer who can't putt.\" I gave monetary policy my best shot in our studio. The question is which club will the Fed swing as it goes out? My trusty caddy with a club or two. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Now, most of you who watch this program know my view on golf. Brings a good walk fiddling with sticks. Donald Trump wants a driver to hit a full one percent basis cut, something along the lines of -- he is not going to get it.</p><p>Instead, investors are betting far more likely on a nice chip. They're going to use a wedge and aim for a cut of 50 to 75 basis points by the end of the year with a bit of luck and a following wind.</p><p>Oh, so close. There is a chance, however, that despite presidential criticism, Chair Powell will use his putting skills with a nice short 25 percent basis points.</p><p>A couple of those wouldn't go amiss. There we go there. One, two, three. You get the idea.</p><p>[09:05:21]</p><p>QUEST: Now the Fed has a somewhat more scientific method for making decisions. Richard Clarida gave me a tour of the floor where policy is made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARIDA: I get chills every day walking in. It's a lot of history in this building, in these hallways, and as you'll see, it's pretty compact along here. The Governors are all along this corridor, so when I want to see Chair Powell or Randy Quarles or Brainard. Mickey Bowman, it's not -- I have to make an appointment or a 20-minute walk because she just walked down the hall.</p><p>QUEST: Do you -- I mean, do you really do that?</p><p>CLARIDA: Oh, yes.</p><p>QUEST: That you're popping into each other's office and sort of -- have you seen this? Or coffee for that?</p><p>CLARIDA: Certainly. Certainly, Chair Powell has walk-in privileges as do the other Governors, and we see each other a lot. We have lunch regularly.</p><p>May, I give you a little tour of the Board.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>CLARIDA: This is obviously --</p><p>QUEST: There it is.</p><p>CLARIDA: The seal.</p><p>QUEST: Wow.</p><p>CLARIDA: So Richard, this is -- this is where it all takes place eight times a year. I always wonder, how did they come up with eight? Not 12 or six, but eight times a year, so we meet.</p><p>I can come show you our chairs. We actually -- in case we forget, we actually have little labels indicating where we sit. So you'll see this is my seat and this is Chair Powell and Vice Chair Quarles and Governor Brainard and Bowman, so we all sit along this side.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, so the Governors are on this side.</p><p>CLARIDA: The Governors are on this side and then when we have meetings of the full committee, the rest of the committee members, the Reserve Bank President, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia will all sit around the table and then the rest of the room is filled with the staff.</p><p>So these are big meetings. As you'll see, it fills the room.</p><p>QUEST: And is it cut and thrust? Or is it -- I mean --</p><p>CLARIDA: Excuse me?</p><p>QUEST: Is there cut and thrust?</p><p>CLARIDA: Oh, sure. And luckily for Fed watchers, there are transcripts of the meetings released with a five-year lag, so you can go back and you -- and including sometimes attempts at humor that work and sometimes don't work.</p><p>I should say, although, you should look at these plaques, they are very interesting. This room was actually used extensively during World War II, too in order to basically -- to game plan the D-Day invasion. It was done in this room.</p><p>Read the plaque, \"The decisions reached in this room during '43 and '44 set the pattern for Allied collaboration for the successful prosecution of World War II.\"</p><p>QUEST: And all the reserve notes on the wall.</p><p>CLARIDA: And we have some reserve notes on the wall, and we have a nice big map up here to remind us of the country is divided into 12 Reserve Districts. And so that map indicates.</p><p>QUEST: Final question, so last time, accused of squeezing more out. Final question, is it more difficult for you? You used to commentate? You're an expert, an economist. Is it more -- was it difficult for you to realize that the sort of things you might have said on my program, you can no longer really just as freely say, because it will move markets.</p><p>CLARIDA: Well, that's obviously a consideration and also I try to be very careful doing any of that to distinguish between my particular view and the sense of the committee because any decision on policies of the committee decision not a Richard Clarida decision, so I try to be careful with that.</p><p>QUEST: But you can't just freelance.</p><p>CLARIDA: I try not to freelance.</p><p>QUEST: Pleasure. Thank you very much.</p><p>CLARIDA: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for showing us round. This is magnificent.</p><p>CLARIDA: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Aside from Fed policy, another great unknown this year -- Brexit. The U.K. was supposed to leave the E.U. back in March, and instead, we saw extensions, elections and plenty of shouting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I have got some advice for the Right Honorable Gentleman, look behind you.</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS: Order. Order.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: There is only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in this House, and he is on that bench.</p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY: I think that that's quite enough of the playground politics of the Conservative Party this evening.</p><p>JOHNSON: Call the election, you great big girl's blouse.</p><p>BERCOW: Don't just stipulate. Don't rant. Spare us the theatrics. Behave yourself. Be a good boy, young man.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Order. Order. When it comes to the Brexit mess, the writing is well and truly on the wall literally. One artist offered up this interpretation of Theresa May sleepwalking and falling over hurdles earlier this year, and the man behind the work can by the name Loretto. I asked him, what led him to this project.</p><p>[09:10:04]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LORETTO, GRAFFITI ARTIST: I feel so inspired about all these things that happened actually, you know, on the quality from here and other countries, United States and I think it's a lot of inspiration for artists really.</p><p>QUEST: But your art -- you're not European?</p><p>LORETTO: No.</p><p>QUEST: But you've decided that this satirical art against Brexit, what was the motivation when you feel the mood of the country?</p><p>LORETTO: It's like, I think, as an artist, we feel some chimes as inspirational how people feel.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so what are you saying about Brexit here?</p><p>LORETTO: Why do I say -- I think she need to think what people are thinking and what people are telling, because I think a leader must do sometimes what people won't expect her to do, yes, and I think --</p><p>QUEST: Are you surprised at how popular these pictures have been? I saw lots of people take them?</p><p>LORETTO: I'm so happy about it.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, it has been quite a -- people are taking pictures and when I saw you the other day, people coming up and talking to you.</p><p>LORETTO: Yes, I like that.</p><p>QUEST: What are they saying about it? What are they saying?</p><p>LORETTO: They like the artworks. They like the meaning. They like the color because I want also to create something beautiful about maybe a higher moment. Yes. Because this is all about life, right? Through her moments, we can create something good, you know.</p><p>And give some sort of message, yes, and also, in another hand to do like a comedy about like a comedian.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Well, Britain didn't manage to leave the E.U. this year. I did manage to leave Britain and went all the way to Australia on the longest flight the world.</p><p>QUEST: 2019 was such a busy year in one's travels. Airports, trains, journeys galore. And I have the passport stamps to prove it. All told, I was in London for some 20 trips with Brexit this and Brexit that. I've been to Finland, twice, Helsinki. And the capital of Christmas, Rovaniemi, where it's all about Santa Claus.</p><p>Marrakech with the camels. Hawaii with the tropical drinks and a summer rest about the Queen Mary 2. There were elephants in Sri Lanka and of course, a quilt in Edinburg.</p><p>But as you and I know, travel isn't there any catching a bit there and the destination, it's about the journey, too. Qantas designed Project Sunrise to be the world's longest flight from London to Sydney. Now, this was the expectation.</p><p>[09:15:05]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Imagine sitting here for 19 straight hours. Qantas wants to see how people handle the world's longest routes and it is running test flights before -- do you have to? That's disgusting.</p><p>Commercial -- this isn't much better. Commercial services, it's all in aid of Project Sunrise. Get me out of here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, Project Sunrise is turning more and more towards reality. And the reality is more spacious, though no less trying. From the science of our sleep to a rare double sunrise. The flight was as much an experiment as it was an experience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): 4:30 in the morning when check-in begins.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you checking any baggage in?</p><p>QUEST (voice over): For QS 7879, the flight from London to Sydney.</p><p>QUEST: Good morning.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): We lift off before dawn and head east and our first sunrise on this double sunrise flight. It's a rare aviation event for the same flight to see two sunrises across different days. Even the Qantas CEO takes time to capture the moment.</p><p>This flight is all about research for both crew and passengers. Learning how our bodies handle long ultra-long haul.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This really gives us a good indication of their sleep behavior at different times.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): That means exercise. Luckily, the plane is empty.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): This flight is an airline CEO's nightmare. Rows and rows of empty seats. They have to be empty. If they were filled with passengers, we would never get to Sydney.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The flight is also about research with the pilots and their brain patterns. Qantas will need to convince regulators to allow pilots to be on duty for up to 24 hours.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm wearing an EEG monitor. This one will measure the alertness level while I'm sitting in the flight deck operating. I'll switch to a different one for night.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Our first meal is crafted to promote sleep.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the way we've designed the menu is to really support the sleep cycles and the wake cycles throughout the flight. We've got the high GI bread, and we're pairing that with dishes that have good quality for example, and that helps to encourage the production of serotonin and melatonin.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Halfway there and over China, some are sleeping, others or not, I'm just enjoying the experience.</p><p>Our second sunrise comes as we pass the Philippines. It's thought less than a thousand passengers in total have experienced the double sunrise.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): We're flying over the South China Sea and we've been airborne for some 12 hours, and we still have the equivalent of London to New York to do.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Qantas has put a lot of money and effort into ultra- long haul research far more than other airlines who have similar routes.</p><p>Alan Joyce explains why.</p><p>ALAN JOYCE, CEO, QANTAS: You can't do the type of studying that we're doing on regular flights. The pilot has got to be wearing headgear. They've got to be testing you and I and you can't do that regular flights that you can do on these delivery flights.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Before long, we're on final approach. This flight has got much faster than I expected. Not exactly sure what I've done for all these hours. We landed in Sydney.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations on that flight.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Now, we've broken the record. Yes, we've made history.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): So it looks like we've done it. The longest flight in the world in both time at about 19 hours 19 minutes and distance, well over 10,000 miles. Two records, one flight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Flying takes a toll on the environment that much we are well aware. And 2019 saw calls to de-incentivize frequent flying, and a new willingness from airlines to tackle environmental issues.</p><p>Qantas' Chief Executive Alan Joyce told me he is aware there's a problem and said his airline is working to fix it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You're going carbon neutral by 2050. Aviation airlines, you are the whipping boy now in the environmental debate.</p><p>JOYCE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that's unfair?</p><p>JOYCE: Well, you know, I think you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. You know, the positives of aviation that it has generated for the world. It gets people to understand different communities, different cultures, it gets people to visit family and friends. It promotes business. It promotes economic activity, and we are conscious that a large part of our communities now are uncomfortable with traveling.</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>JOYCE: We need to fix that, and what airlines have to do like we have is commit that we will get to net carbon neutral by 2050. That we give people the ability to offset our carbon emissions; that we do develop sustainable aviation fuel, which is what we're doing. Because you cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think though -- I find with carbon offsetting schemes, I always -- when I say it's not -- it's a scam. But I always wonder where the money goes? Who audits it? And it almost seems like a jolly good idea, but I'm not sure it works.</p><p>JOYCE: So the schemes that we have, and we've got one of the biggest schemes in the world, 10 percent of our customers on qantas.com offset the carbon emissions. They are certified by the Australian government. They have to deliver a benefit that that is certified, so it goes through a very rigorous process that we audit, that the government audits and with that --</p><p>QUEST: But it is still seen as a do-gooder thing. You know, you tick the box, whatever, but if you ask most business travelers, they don't do it.</p><p>JOYCE: So I'll tell you what? A lot of our corporate accounts are now doing it as part of their dealing with Qantas and all of Qantas's duty travel are offset against carbon emissions.</p><p>QUEST: Carbon neutral by 2050. Can you not do it sooner?</p><p>JOYCE: So no, I think to get there, you're going to need to develop a sustainable aviation fuel, and to get that to be an economic alternative is going to take a number of years, I think to get there. And it's going to need new technology.</p><p>We're replacing all the 747s by the end of next year. But the new technology, a new aircraft is going to be key in also helping get there. Can I say also for people that are having a view on carbon offsetting, isn't it better to do that than nothing?</p><p>And I would encourage people, really to offset our carbons, we do as I said, I try and encourage as many of our customers to do it because it is better to contribute back to the environment by offsetting your carbon emissions in projects that I can see having a big benefit to the environment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: One startup has the solution to going green when you get off the plane. It's one small hop for man, one giant leap for the planet. Yes, it's pogo sticks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, well done. Genius are hopping mad. The Swedish startup Cangoroo is launching a pogo stick rental service from San Francisco to Paris.</p><p>Now, it is the alternative to the one that I've been using, which is highly preferable -- where am I going? Just bear with me one moment, I promise you I will return. Yes, it's highly good, and we've done this one before.</p><p>But why would you forsake this to go with this? Right. How realistic all of it? Smart pogo sticks count your jumps. It also has a GPS to keep you bouncing the right way. It'll cost $1.00 to unlock 30 cents per minute. It's not allowed on the highways and indeed in the studios and we will probably all be fired.</p><p>Adam Mikkelsen is the CEO and cofounder of Cangoroo. He joins me from Malmo, Sweden via Skype. You can't be serious about this?</p><p>ADAM MIKKELSEN, CEO AND COFOUNDER, CANGOROO: Well, in fact we are. And like thinking about it, like we don't see that we're actually going to compete with the e-scooters per se, but what we do see is that having pogo sticks in the city especially by, you know, city parks and boardwalks and stuff like that people could, you know, have fun and they could, you know, get some well needed workouts into their daily routine. So we've got a demand for it.</p><p>QUEST: So where did the idea come from? Because it's not the sort of thing you wake up on an average Tuesday and think, you know, I think I'm going to bring out the pogo stick.</p><p>MIKKELSEN: Yes, so basically with a background in branding and marketing, we run an advertising agency as well. So we've been following the micromobility industry for quite a while, and what we saw was basically that all of today's players are quite generic in the industry.</p><p>So we -- basically, we saw an opening for a brand to launch that are actually kind of putting brand first. And you know, naturally, the pogo sticks won't be our only product, but we definitely see that as our main product.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And the man who promised to do whatever it takes to save the euro has stepped down. Now, there's a new head of the European Central Bank.</p><p>[09:25:46]</p><p>QUEST: He 2019 brought changes at the top of some of the world's most important financial institutions. For instance, Christine Lagarde left the IMF to join the European Central Bank replacing Mario Draghi.</p><p>Anna Stewart looks back at the man known as Super Mario.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice over): He is known as Super Mario, the man who saved the Eurozone.</p><p>He became head of European Central Bank in the middle of the European debt crisis. Europe had already bailed out Ireland, Portugal and Greece and anti-austerity protests were sweeping across the continent. Markets were in turmoil. Politicians were worried about the breakup of the Eurozone.</p><p>Then in July 2012, Mario Draghi said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIO DRAGHI, FORMER HEAD OF EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK: The ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): It wasn't even an official ECB meeting, but that speech defined Draghi's legacy. Three words, whatever it takes. It was enough to calm investors' nerves, the Eurozone survived.</p><p>And although Draghi backed up his words with action, an emergency bond buying program with OMT, it was never needed. In his eight years as ECB President, Draghi never raised interest rates.</p><p>In fact he took rates into negative territory. He also has a store of controversial program of stimulus buying nearly $3 trillion of Eurozone assets. One press conference stands out in Draghi's career.</p><p>In 2015, a feminist activist made a surprise appearance. She showers him confetti while yelling, \"End the ECB dictatorship.\" As soon as she was removed, Draghi coolly returned to his statement.</p><p>It wasn't just what he said but what he wore that drew the attention of the financial world. Some claiming the color of his tie indicated his stance on monetary policy, the methodology diligently pursued by French bank, Credit Agricole, only be found completely lacking of any real correlation.</p><p>No doubt his successor, Christine Lagarde will undergo similar scrutiny, perhaps on the color of her scarves.</p><p>Draghi enjoyed the job, despite the enormous pressures it presented.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DRAGHI: It was originally an obligation, then it became a welcome obligation, and then even a pleasure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): Meanwhile, journalists wanted forward guidance on his next career move. His answer --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DRAGHI: But if you want more information, just ask my wife.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice over): Anna Stewart, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Christine Lagarde says she trusts Mario Draghi has done the right thing. Some of Draghi's colleagues disagreed with his whatever it takes redux and resigned. That means Christine Lagarde is walking into a bank that's divided on the future of stimulus.</p><p>At the IMF Headquarters in Washington, she told me dissent is healthy and even necessary, up to a point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, THEN OUTGOING MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF: You know, it's -- I think it is good that there are different opinions. And if it was unanimity consensus, there would be none of that debate which is so necessary and productive because who has the ultimate gospel on economics? On monetary policies? There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of questioning going on at the moment.</p><p>What actually works? What doesn't work? What are the good transmission channels? So I think to have the debate is very healthy and very good and there should be room for dissent.</p><p>I think what I'm most concerned about, and it's been my life and my DNA is to bring people together and once the decision is made to actually live with it and speak to it. Because it's been the decision of the group.</p><p>QUEST: Is that even possible at something like the ECB?</p><p>LAGARDE: We'll see. We'll see. As I said, debate, dissent, arguments -- all of that is necessary and it's healthy. Once the decision is made, there should be a landscape where we're all in it together and we'll move forward.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, we have to always come back to fixing the roof while the sun shines.</p><p>[09:30:03]</p><p>QUEST: You've done a lot of work on structural reform here at the Fund, but countries have done nowhere near enough. It's even worse in Europe, where a certain element of structural reform has been done. But the move towards that single digital market, all the other things that the ECB has been calling for are still -- do you have great hopes for success?</p><p>LAGARDE: I will certainly advocate and do my part in order to help deeper and better structural reforms to just unleash the potential of Europeans' enterprises, households, entrepreneurs, because there is a richness there that in many instances is restricted or refrained by too much bureaucracy, not enough mobility, not enough flexibility and fluidity, so I will do the best I can in my field.</p><p>QUEST: But now you're really going to be tested, aren't you? Because you're going into an economic field, and really what this job now requires is not a PhD or an economist, it requires somebody who can pull this whole thing together, isn't it? Who can keep this train on the tracks?</p><p>LAGARDE: Yes, keep the train on tracks and drive the monetary bus in the direction of stability and cohesion, and I will do the best I can to do that job.</p><p>QUEST: Do you worry that you can be bamboozled by the economists?</p><p>LAGARDE: They've always tried to do that with me. You know, when I joined as Minister of Finance, they all said at the time, she's a lawyer. Well, I can listen, I can absorb. I've eaten a lot of files and tried to understand a lot of concepts. I don't master them, and I'll never be a PhD in Economics, let alone macro, you know, macroeconomics or econometrics.</p><p>I've had it at the IMF as well. You know, it's a fantastic institution, which is largely dominated by economists. They probably all thought at the time, she's a lawyer. She was a Finance Minister for a little while, but she is just a lawyer.</p><p>Well, again, I can listen. I can absorb. I can learn from everybody. I'm sure the same thing will happen to me at the ECB, we'll see.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: We couldn't let Madam Lagarde go to Frankfurt empty handed and for luck, we couldn't open our present inside, so we went to the roof of the IMF.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You constantly say fix the roof while the sun shines.</p><p>LAGARDE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Where you are going, it's not bad.</p><p>LAGARDE: It's so bad. It's not raining. You're right. But the sun is not really shining either, yet.</p><p>QUEST: And where you're going, arguably, there are more rain showers. Arguably, a lot more rain showers in Frankfurt, ECB, Eurozone, Brexit -- so we figured you'd need this. We figured you need this. It is your own umbrella, but despite the fact it is dark outside in your world, it is always sunny.</p><p>LAGARDE: Being optimistic has a lot to do with inspiring confidence. And that's what we are very short of at the moment. Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>LAGARDE: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Bill Campbell was one of the most influential players in Silicon Valley, and most of us never even knew who he was. He coached the biggest bosses in high tech and big tech, from Bill Gates, to Steve Jobs to Eric Schmidt, and two fellow Alphabet alums who wrote a book on just how and why Campbell was so effective.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: You've all had mentors. You've had mentors. You've had professional mentors. You've had people who have guided you? What was the difference here?</p><p>ALAN EAGLE, DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS, GOOGLE: You know, it's both very difficult and very simple. A lot of the things that Bill did, any of us can do as managers and leaders. You know, it starts with being a good manager running a tight ship. Second, building trust and really listening to people, really having their back.</p><p>ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ALPHABET: But almost everybody I know, the first reaction they have is, I don't need a coach. By the way, that was my reaction. That was his reaction.</p><p>JONATHAN ROSENBERG, ADVISOR, ALPHABET: It was my reaction, too.</p><p>SCHMIDT: We don't need coaches.</p><p>QUEST: So what would you say to me, if I say to you, I don't need a coach if I work for you. What would you say?</p><p>SCHMIDT: I'd say, do tennis players have coaches?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Yes. And the tennis players are better than the coaches, aren't they? And still they have coaches. Maybe coaching is different than doing --</p><p>ROSENBERG: Is every one of your shows terrific?</p><p>QUEST: Oh, that's a very nasty question. I'll thank you not to go there.</p><p>ROSENBERG: What Bill would do if he were here, he would have told you that you're the best host in the industry. And then one day when you had a show that wasn't so good, he'd say, you know, you weren't your best today.</p><p>You're much more likely to listen to somebody who behaves that way.</p><p>SCHMIDT: Notice he didn't say that you did a bad job. He said you could have done better and then you yourself, make yourself better. That's what coaching is.</p><p>Coaching is letting you see where you can be and getting you then --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: After the break, as \"Top Gun\" makes a comeback, I underwent a stomach churning, acrobatic jet experience. I was inverted and tossed around the skies. I need to sit down.</p><p>[09:37:48]</p><p>QUEST: It is time to open up the presents. Maybe a model plane if you're lucky. The Breitling Jet Team gave me a truly tremendous gift earlier this year, my very own \"Top Gun\" moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): This is not your typical flight where you ensure your seatbelt is fastened --</p><p>Seven thousand feet above ground, and the Breitling Jet Team, it's a battle of lumps.</p><p>It all began in such an orderly fashion. Excitement overflowing in the room.</p><p>GEORGE KERN, CEO, BREITLING: So Richard would be in position number three and we will have a fantastic view on the whole jet -- the seven jets. It's frightening, but I'm sure he will enjoy it.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): For this sort of flight, preparation is everything.</p><p>KERN: This one. You have to wear this one. This is your size.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): You can't fly if you're not dressed properly.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Perfectly comfortable.</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Like any other flight. Here, there is a safety briefing. But this one involves ejector seats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go.</p><p>QUEST: And so into the air where everything changed. I was fine for the first loop. The barrel roll had me in stitches.</p><p>[09:40:10]</p><p>QUEST (voice over): And then, the second loop. (INAUDIBLE) requires you wear a veil over the rest.</p><p>Back on the ground, I can reflect the pilot's skills, the plane's performance, the excellence of the experience. I feel elated. Let's be honest though, I won't be doing this again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: In a year of acrimony over impeachment and Brexit, there was one feel good moment that took place in July, the world celebrated one of mankind's greatest achievements -- 50 years since this moment.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>QUEST: That that was the result of course of years of effort, setbacks, sacrifice. Sir Richard Branson told me how the moon landing half a century ago prompted him to start his own space company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD BRANSON, FOUNDER, VIRGIN GALACTIC: I think if Neil and Buzz had not landed on the moon, we wouldn't be running Virgin Galactic, our space company and I suspect Elon and Jeff wouldn't have been running theirs.</p><p>So it was for me, it was what inspired me to ultimately start Virgin Galactic and get people into space.</p><p>QUEST: You were 19 when the event happened, and I'm guessing you remember it very well.</p><p>BRANSON: I was sitting in front of a tiny black and white TV set. There was only one channel in those days, BBC and with my family, my sisters, we were all huddled around the TV in our pajamas, watching, you know, the most extraordinary event and it was just one of those things -- I mean, maybe the only one in my lifetime, there was nothing but good attached to it.</p><p>And you had all the best scientists in the world getting together to make it happen. The last time we have had with America who got together to make something happen, it was the nuclear bombs, so how lovely that we had something that the whole world could embrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now in October, his company, Virgin Galactic boldly went where no space company has gone before -- a public listing. Sir Richard told us it's all part of his quest to get Virgin Galactic moving faster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRANSON: What's exciting is the public can now invest in a spaceship company, they've never been able to do that before. They can invest in the best spaceship company, there is -- Virgin Galactic.</p><p>And we've managed to get the resources from this flow for Virgin Galactic to expand rapidly the number of spaceships we've got. And the advantage of expanding the amount of spaceships we've got rapidly is that we'll be able to start bringing the price down in the years to come. So, you know, it's great -- it's great to be able to prove that we have built a company that the public love and the institutions love and it's so far so good.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: When I look at this spaceship, I mean, it looks like an airplane. I know that you guys do have an ambition to get into hypersonic travel as well, which is, I mean, it will help someone like me who's always in the air. But how quickly can that happen?</p><p>GEORGE WHITESIDES, CEO, VIRGIN GALAGTIC: Well, I think what's exciting is that when we are operating commercially, and we've already done this in test flight is we're going to be the only company that's bringing people on a winged vehicle at Mach 3-plus speeds, right? So that's really tremendous, right? That's a huge thing.</p><p>And we're going to be developing, you know, a ton of data that will help us design future vehicles, and that's going to come --</p><p>GIOKOS: Is that under process already?</p><p>WHITSIDES: Yes, it is already in the process. And so -- and so, you know, we recently had this great investment from Boeing, you know, which put a bit of money into the company and that closed along with this deal, and we're going to work with them to think about high speed mobility solutions, right?</p><p>How do we get people from one place to another, you know, much faster on the Earth's surface? And so we don't know where that journey will exactly lead in terms of what the exact design will be. But I think it's an exciting pathway and it is like you say, it is a huge market for --</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, I know</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Throughout the year, we watched Beyond Meat and its share price. It seems to be the gift that kept on giving. It was one of the best performing IPOs of the year. That was then, this is now. We'll take a look at how the fake meat performed against the real thing. We had a full throttle taste test.</p><p>[09:46:58]</p><p>QUEST: I love the holiday season, all the treats, cookies for me, a biscuit or two and carrot for Rudolph. The year was the year of fake meat. Beyond Meat stocks skyrocketed. Its rival Impossible Foods said it had no plans to follow suit and go public.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID LEE, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, IMPOSSIBLE FOODS: Well, investors look at $1.5 trillion meat and dairy market globally and they're recognizing the meat eaters and we see this every day, consumers of the Impossible Whopper are saying you know what, we want something better. And that's a huge opportunity for the business as well as the mission to make the world a better place.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, but the -- you must have been greatly fortified when you saw the way Beyond Meat did? Rocket on the market.</p><p>LEE: We were extremely pleased for them and for anyone who seeks to serve the mission we have.</p><p>QUEST: But you don't intend to stay private forever, do you? Shouldn't you be turning those yet?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just a couple more seconds and we'll get into that. You'll see that you'll sear, it's just like beef.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, it is. It is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The visual cues are exactly the same. It responds the same and you can use it for much more than a burger.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, meatballs, meatloaf, lasagna, tacos -- you name it. Anything that you can do with the ground meat.</p><p>LEE: Dumplings in Hong Kong. It's in Korean food in Macau. It performs like beef, it transforms though it is plant based.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So back to your financials.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Mr. Lee, you're a private company. You don't have to reveal, but you are going to have to reveal at some point. When -- let's just go straight -- a simple question. When do you hope to IPO? If only because your investors will wish to realize and have an avenue out?</p><p>LEE: We have to give our investors great return. There is no question. But that does not presuppose that we have to IPO.</p><p>QUEST: You are in -- and are you in competition with Beyond Meat? You sort of have an amalgam of overlap in the restaurant business, but they are meat to consumer, you are meat to the industry.</p><p>LEE: I think that our competition for Impossible Foods is not Beyond Meat. We don't compete really for capital. We don't compete for share of stomach. Our consumer is the meat eater. Our true competition for the meat eater is what they're choosing to eat today from an animal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: I then had dinner with Guru La Monica where we put the fake meat to a real test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Do you think this is the future? I will wait until you finish. What did it taste like first?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: There's a lot of ketchup on here so I taste the ketchup. No, I've never had the Beyond Meat burger before. I will admit I like the Impossible better. I've had the Impossible burger several times, including at the now defunct corporate cafe in this building.</p><p>But as a person who does not feel any reason to stop eating meat, I will enjoy a meatless, plant-based burger every now and then I don't feel like I'm missing all that much.</p><p>[09:50:07]</p><p>QUEST: All right, try the -- that was the Beyond. Try the Impossible.</p><p>LA MONICA: Try the Impossible.</p><p>QUEST: Which sort of looks a little more meaty.</p><p>LA MONICA: I like the fact that it has that texture and the red meat sort of feel to it.</p><p>QUEST: But they are not IPO-ing yet, are they? At some point they will, no doubt?</p><p>LA MONICA: I would have to think they will especially as I talk with my mouth full, I hope my mother is not watching or my wife for that matter. I think that Impossible will eventually need to go public in order to stay competitive with Beyond and also, Richard, the key thing is Beyond Meat -- Impossible does not have a retail presence yet. That's something they're working on.</p><p>I'm looking forward to the day where I can buy one of these and make it at home. You can't do that yet. I think an IPO will help them in that regard.</p><p>QUEST: Now, this is the meat one. The real meat. Can you tell the difference? Can you tell the difference?</p><p>LA MONICA: I can actually. There's something about the texture. It's juicier. I think that Beyond Meat and Impossible have done an admirable job of mimicking the mouth-feel for lack of a better word -- has that ever been used on CNNI before -- of real beef, but there is no substitute for a real meat burger in my --</p><p>QUEST: But if I'm playing with my food that's what --</p><p>LA MONICA: You shouldn't do that, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I know, but --</p><p>LA MONICA: The dad in me says you should not.</p><p>QUEST: That's what the three of them look like. Now can you tell which is which just from that? Can you tell because it gets to the point where you really can't, but does it really matter? Who is going to be the winner in this?</p><p>LA MONICA: Beef versus plant based or Impossible versus Beyond Meat?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: I mean, I think that clearly, clearly, I think that both of these companies have done a good job of catering to people like us who want to eat a real beef burger, but occasionally have the plant-based, healthier non-meat solution as well.</p><p>But I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to Shake Shack anytime soon and try and ask for a meatless burger if they have one.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Well, it was very kind of you to join me for dinner. I have to dash, and you'll take care of the check. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, which one? Which one? Decisions. Decisions. Still to come. Old shows become new media. The fight for content breaks out across the streaming landscape. Oh, I can't have that one.</p><p>QUEST: The Holiday times is for lazing on the couch and Clare and I are cozy here on the couch from \"Friends,\" not our favorite Christmas shows and movies. But this year it's going to be a lot more complicated when it comes to deciding what to watch.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Richard. This year, there's a slew of streaming services. In Christmas past, of course, we have Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now, Christmas present -- we can add in Disney Plus and Apple Plus and by Christmas future, we will have Peacock, HBO Max and BritBox which announced their launch this year.</p><p>QUEST: Except they're all still fighting over content and content these days is about good old fashioned programs, and shows like \"Friends.\"</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Exactly. \"Friends,\" 236 episodes, 10 seasons still on Netflix, but not for long because it's moving to HBO Max next year. It's a sitcom, but it's also a streaming staple, Richard, and big brands have been cashing in on its nostalgic revival.</p><p>QUEST: Turn up the telly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): From product placement --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This wonder broom is amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:10]</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): To memorabilia and even haircuts, \"Friends\" has always been a brand that sells.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): And 25 years on that hasn't changed. It's still not enough of you as just to watch the show. They want to live in the world of Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Phoebe and Joey and that means eating their food, sitting on their couch and of course, drinking their coffee.</p><p>And businesses are taking advantage. Coffee chain, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf jumped at the chance of a tie up for the anniversary launching a special edition range of coffee specialty drinks and memorabilia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRIN KELLARIS, VP MARKETING, COFFEE BEANS AND TEA LEAF: Our \"Friends\" themed coffee mugs we pre-released and actually sold out in about three hours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): They also hosted two pop up Central Perk events in Los Angeles in August.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLARIS: Those two locations we saw significant spikes in foot traffic, but more importantly as a business it really bolstered system wide sales.</p><p>RACHEL GREEN, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): \"Pottery Barn\" also brought back the famous apothecary table which despite its thousand dollar price tag is a top seller in its department, the company says, it must be the antique properties.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHOEBE BUFFAY, FICTIONAL CHARACTER, FRIENDS: You can almost smell the opium.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Even Lego is getting in on the action with a $60.00 replica of Central Perk. Lego says it's one of its fastest selling sets ever.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): Now, of course, none of these promotions would work nearly as well if \"Friends\" hadn't experienced a revival in the age of streaming. Last year, it was Netflix's second most watched show and the company reportedly paid around $100 million to keep the rights to the show for one more year before it goes on a break, moving to Warner Media's HBO Max streaming service in 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, EQUITY ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: It's an iconic show and ultimately it's really one of the crown jewels of streaming.

It's the biggest economic debate happening right now, especially given the huge potential political implications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Team Trump is optimistic. White House economists predict the 2018 upturn in GDP growth to 3 percent is here to stay thanks in large part to the GOP tax cuts for business investment.</p><p> But most forecasters, whether on Wall Street or at the Congressional Budget Office and Federal Reserve in Washington, are skeptical. They see growth easing back toward the 2 percent pace seen since the Great Recession.</p><p> What's more, one popular recession predictor  when long-term interest rates fall below short-term yields  is flashing a worrisome warning sign.But there's something important that might be starting to happen inside the American economy that could confound all those forecasts.</p><p> And it has to do with innovation. Now, \"innovation\" is far more than just a business consultant buzzword.</p><p> Better technology and techniques conjure the deep magic of any successful modern economy. Just adding machines and workers only gets you so far.</p><p> And if the U.S.</p><p> is to grow anywhere near as fast in the future as in the past, greater innovation-driven productivity will be indispensable.But economy-wide innovation has been in a funk, up just a meager 0.</p><p>4 percent annually since 2007 vs. 1.</p><p>4 percent annually between 1995 and 2007. At least until last year, that is. Multifactor productivity  again, the part of productivity growth accounted for by technological progress rather than better-trained workers or more buildings and software  rose by 1.</p><p>0 percent in 2018, the strongest gain since the current expansion began in 2010. Without it, the U.S.</p><p> economy would have only grown about two-thirds as fast over the past 60 years.What's really exciting is this: Economists have been waiting and wondering when all the tech advances of the past decade  smartphones, AI, big data, drones  would start showing up in the productivity stats.</p><p> It's been reminiscent of how economists wondered the same thing about the computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s  right before the 1990s tech boom. But sometimes it take a while for businesses to figure things out.</p><p> It took more than a half century for steam power to overtake water as the largest power source in Great Britain. It also took about as long for even half of U.</p><p>S. factories to become electrified after the introduction of the alternating-current electric motor.</p><p>One American economist familiar with this history is former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Although frequently cited as one of the key people responsible for the financial crisis, Greenspan in the 1990s was one of the first experts to notice something was up with productivity, much to the skepticism of many of his colleagues and staffers.</p><p> \"In the end, the chairman turned out to be right,\" writes economist and former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer in his book A Term at the Fed. \"His call on the productivity acceleration was a truly great one.</p><p>\"So maybe Silicon Valley and the rest of Corporate America are finally resolving the current productivity paradox. If so, it's of much greater economic importance than anything happening in Washington these days.</p><p> An innovation boom will make it a lot easier for the economy to grow closer to 3 percent rather than 2 percent, even if the deficit-driven stimulative effects from Trumponomics fade as most economists predict.Of course, the irony is that all this tech progress might be occurring just as Washington is turning on Big Tech.</p><p> Many Democrats and Republicans seem eager to heavily regulate or break up Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. Maybe it's time they paused to see if this incipient innovation boomlet turns into something more.</p><p>Source: The Week Translated by Jennifer</p><p>body</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINFIN-XINFINAGY29032019018014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS1-X331-JCH9-G3SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433732</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Xinhua Finance Agency (AP) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua Financial News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Warburg and its consortium partners ran a long and \"hairy\" gauntlet of regulators and investors to take the company off the public market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He reserves real anger, however, for a group of hedge funds who he claims attempted to use Britain's arcane takeover system to extract a higher price from Warburg on the steps of the High Court last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You know, it was a hold-up,\" he says with New York brio. \"It was a genuine hold-up. Finally, we said the best way to react to a bully is to punch him in the nose, and that's what we did.\" The hedgies, led by Oaktree Capital Management, were threatening to derail the Inmarsat deal, valued at \u00a35bn including debt, at the last moment.</p><p>They claimed that the company was worth much more than shareholders had agreed to sell it for back in May. The hedgies seemed prepared to argue to the High Court that long-standing plans for a wireless broadband network in America were on the cusp of regulatory approval, with Inmarsat poised to make billions of dollars over the coming years. If a judge refused to issue the normal rubber stamp as a result, Zilberman and his team would have little choice but to pay up or see the deal and the millions invested in research, advisory and legal fees evaporate.</p><p>Instead, they decided to call their bluff. On the eve of the hearing Warburg and its partners made their offer for Inmarsat final and set the deadline in stone. It meant that if the hedgies had gone through with their court challenge and won there would be no takeover at all. They promptly folded and Zilberman got his rubber stamp on Tuesday.</p><p>\"These guys weren't long -term holders of Inmarsat,\" he says. \"They only bought the stock when they saw there was a merger. Their whole strategy was to wait to the last second and try to block the field and basically get a bribe. For our guys it was really a case of calling their bluff and saying 'look, take it or leave it'.</p><p>\"It's just unfortunate that the financial markets are such that they allow financial bullies to operate in this way.\"</p><p>The victory underscores what Zilberman says has been a record year for Warburg in Europe.</p><p>In April it was behind the \u00a32.2bn London float of the payments processor Network International, which has since gained more than a third in value. Overall Zilberman's team have completed 15 deals in 18 months and new funds have been raised to give it more than \u00a315bn in reserve for European buyouts.</p><p>\"For one firm to have the secondbiggest IPO in Europe with Network International and the second-biggest take-private with Inmarsat is pretty cool,\" says Zilberman. \"We sold three companies in each case generating over a 30 per cent return.\"</p><p>Warburg, which having been founded a block away from the New York Stock Exchange in 1966 is about as venerable as it gets in private equity, appears to have at last hit on a formula that works after years of patchy performance on this side of the Atlantic.</p><p>Zilberman claims the progress is down to a long-term effort to train up staff in-house, in contrast to its earlier practice of poaching senior executives from rival firms and investment banks. After a few years, the policy is generating better ideas and better deals, he says.</p><p>\"Historically in Europe too often we went for the easy answer. We did what everybody else was doing.</p><p>\"So what we said about four years ago was 'we're going to try and build from within'. We're going to take some really talented young guys - I wish they were older but they're not - and we're going to back them and develop them. We're going to plant seeds and water them, and over time they're going to grow into really strong trees.\"</p><p>One such cultivar is Max Fowinkel, who closely watched Inmarsat's struggles as a listed company for years before pouncing. He says the deal is underpinned by a firm belief that over time commercial shipping and airliners will consume more data.</p><p>\"You have 25,000 planes outside of the US and some of the long-haul fleets don't have basic internet access,\" says Fowinkel. \"Inmarsat have the ability over the next five to six years to get to something like a half thousand.\"</p><p>Zilberman adds: \"There are three times in my day when I don't use my phone. When I sleep, when I shower and when I get on a damn aeroplane!\" Fowinkel teamed up on the deal with Rene Obermann, who is now a Warburg employee but in his previous role as Deutsche Telekom chief executive was one of Inmarsat's biggest customers. Bringing in such industrial experience and contacts has also helped deliver an \"edge\".</p><p>Obermann has for instance opened doors to senior management at Vodafone on behalf of Warburg's German fibre-optic broadband business, Zilberman says.</p><p>In buyout markets where there are now tens of billions of dollars looking for a home, the ability to build up businesses is becoming more important in an industry once based almost entirely on financial engineering.</p><p>As private equity has expanded since the financial crisis, Warburg has nearly doubled its funds in the last four years to $65bn as low interest rates and a lack of corporate growth outside Big Tech send investors rushing into the arms of private equity firms. Zilberman says Warburg is further marked out by its willingness to take minority stakes to work with talented management teams who may not want to hand over control. Many public company bosses now look enviously at the pace and patience a buyout can deliver.</p><p>\"I sit on listed company boards as well,\" says Zilberman. \"I can tell you that the decision-making on my private boards is materially better than on public boards. If somebody said to you, 'I can build the next Google', I just need \u00a3100m and six years you say 'absolutely'. Because my investment period is six, seven years, I can take that. But a typical public market investor's average duration for holding a stock is 45 days.\"</p><p>For a company such as Inmarsat, which plans to invest \u00a32.5bn in new satellites over the next five years, the pressures of the public markets proved too much. It was unable to convince the City that, with patience and capital, hurling a broadband network into space would pay off.</p><p>Zilberman says he is now \"looking at plenty\" more buyouts of public companies facing similar challenges. He is very bullish on Britain, Brexit or no Brexit, and given rapid progress at the Warburg portfolio company Reiss, even believes there is money to be made on the high street.</p><p>\"What a disaster retail is,\" he says. \"You walk down the street. You see one failing store after another.</p><p>\"But Reiss is by far the best performing company in our European portfolio. Earnings are going to be up 50 per cent this year.</p><p>\"Why is it doing well and so many competitors doing poorly? Because Reiss is kicking a--. We put in an awesome management team who are putting on the shelves products people want to buy at a reasonable price.\"</p><p>All that remains to cap the year is for Inmarsat to make the hedgies pay its legal fees. Oaktree Capital have suggested to the court the company should cover its costs, but Zilberman won't have it.</p><p>\"That's like being mugged in the street and the guy turning round to you and saying 'why don't you buy me some trainers'. It's crazy.\"</p><p>Facts \u00a35bn The value of the Inmarsat deal, including debt 15 The number of deals the team has done in 18 months 1966 The year Warburg was founded in New York $65bn The amount Warburg has in funds 45 Number of days average investor holds a stock CV ?

At that moment, those of us who had hoped Obama would be a transformative progressive president knew that it was over before it started.The team was headed by Jason Furman, a close protg of investment banker Robert Rubin. But the most senior appointees would eventually be Lawrence Summers as head of the National Economic Council and Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary. They would make sure that the big banks would be bailed out rather than cleaned out. Michael Froman, another Wall Streeter and Rubin ally, was put in charge of trade policy. </p><p>Fiscal conservative Peter Orszag got the top budget job. Rahm Emanuel, an investment-banker-turned-congressman who as head of the DCCC loaded the House with corporate Democrats, became chief of staff.Thanks to these people, even the most catastrophic economic collapse since the Great Depression could not shake the financial industry's lock on Democratic Party policies. Wall Street-influenced deregulation led to the financial collapse. Their failure to reform the financial system after the collapse kept the economy fragile, as we're now painfully aware. The premature embrace of fiscal austerity caused the recession to be deeper and more prolonged than necessary. And all these economic policy failures led to the mother of all political failures\u2014the election of Donald Trump.More from Robert Kuttner[2]As John Maynard Keynes famously said, 'Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.' Indeed, these worthies failed conventionally, and left office with their reputations intact. Most of them repaired to Wall Street, where they increased their incomes many times over. And several of them would like to return to Washington, in senior positions in a Biden administration. If history repeats itself, the second time as farce, it would be a catastrophe\u2014for the Democrats, for the economy, and for the country.One of several weird things about the Biden campaign is that there is hardly any policy staff. Reporters looking to profile the campaign kept looking for one, and concluded that it just wasn't there. So with Biden now the likely nominee, there will be a stampede of people wanting in. And given Biden's age and cognitive state, he will likely be a far more hands-off president than Obama. Which makes his senior appointees even more crucial for the future of the country. Herewith, as a public service, the Biden DNR List, which could stand for Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Reappoint. Larry Summers. Number one on the list has to be Larry Summers, 65. Under Clinton, Summers was a prime architect and huge enthusiast of what proved to be fatal financial deregulation. He was also in charge of Clinton's economic policy for post-SovietRussia, and was responsible for pushing for early and catastrophic privatization of state assets, a fire sale that led directly to the creation of Russia's oligarchs. As president of Harvard, he proved to be both arrogant and sexist, to the point where he got himself fired.Yet Summers has a paradoxical seductive charm, and he persuaded Obama that he was the right person to lead the economic team. In that job, he not only lowballed the necessary economic stimulus and ended it prematurely, but he successfully fought for rescuing the biggest banks rather than taking them into temporary receivership. Back at Harvard, Summers earns over $600,000 as a university professor but also moonlights at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw, where his compensation is well into the seven figures. (Some would say he moonlights at Harvard.) Summers recently played a back-channel role in blackballing economist Gabriel Zucman from an appointment to Harvard's Kennedy School. In a recorded vote, Zucman had the support of every other tenured economist on the school's faculty.The one career-capper job Summers wants is chair of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the work of Elizabeth Warren and other Summers critics, Barack Obama was dissuaded from appointing Summers to that post, in favor of Janet Yellen. Let's hope she also wins the rematch.Peter Orszag. As Obama's budget director, Orszag was a prime architect of premature fiscal austerity as a supposed badge of economic virtue. After leaving government, Orszag, another Rubin protg, got a plum job at Citigroup, where Rubin was a senior executive between 1999 and 2009. Orszag first served as vice chairman of Corporate and Investment Banking and also chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group. From Citi, he moved to boutique investment bank Lazard in 2016, and is now CEO of Lazard's Financial Advisory group, with corporations and governments as clients. He also chaired the Hamilton Project, underwritten by Rubin. Orszag's salary is reported at $15 million a year[3].At 51, Orszag is young enough to want another round in government. He didn't have any of the top power jobs on economic issues\u2014chair of the National Economic Council, Secretary of the Treasury (both previously held by Rubin and Summers), or chair of the Federal Reserve. Mike Froman. Yet another Rubin protg, Mike Froman directed trade policy under Obama as U.S. trade representative. He served on both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council. Froman was prime architect of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the continued emphasis on corporate rights and privileges in trade deals. He worked in the Clinton administration for Rubin in a number of staff jobs, becoming Rubin's chief of staff at Treasury. He then joined Citi after leaving government between 1999 and 2008, also raising money for Obama. Froman, while still at Citi, sketched out Obama's entire cabinet[4] in an email in October 2008, and did the key economic hiring[5] during the transition. Following the Obama years, Froman took senior executive jobs at Citi's insurance and 'alternative investments' (that usually means private equity) businesses. Since 2018, he has been vice chairman and president for strategic growth at MasterCard. His annual compensation is in the tens of millions.Froman's career epitomizes the revolving door between government and Wall Street, and the way Wall Street Democrats use fundraising to ingratiate themselves with Democratic candidates. Froman endorsed Biden early, in November 2019. Like Orszag, Froman (at 57) is young enough to want another taste of political power before the door revolves again.Steve Rattner. At 67, Rattner is the epitome of a corporate Democrat. He has worked at Lehman and Lazard and in 2000 set up his own private equity company, Quadrangle. Rattner has been active with the center-right group Third Way, and currently serves as Mike Bloomberg's personal money manager. As a former New York Times staffer and current contributing columnist, he has been very active writing op-ed pieces and making media appearances trashing progressive candidates, without disclosing the Bloomberg connection.Rattner got in big trouble with the SEC in 2010 for a pay-to-play kickback scheme involving placement of New York state pension funds with his company, which he ultimately settled by paying $7 million via Quadrangle and $6.2 million personally. He was barred from the financial industry for five years. The scandal forced him out of his job heading the Obama administration's auto industry rescue. Rattner has never held a top economic job. 'Rattner would cut off his right arm to be Treasury secretary,' says one insider. If Bloomberg personally goes to bat with Biden on Rattner's behalf, he can probably get something big, though the confirmation would not be pretty.Jeff Zients. He succeeded Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and finished out the Obama presidency as director of the National Economic Council, the job once held by Summers. Zients was in charge of Obama's disastrous 'fiscal cliff' budget strategy, in which Obama's team played a very strong hand badly. Due to sunsetting Bush tax breaks, if Republicans hadn't met Democrats halfway, the result would have been a massive tax hike, mostly on the rich. But Zients, a big proponent of deficit reduction, let Republicans call the shots, resulting in the damaging automatic budget 'sequester.'Before joining Obama, Zients became very rich taking two David Bradley ventures public, The Advisory Board Company and the Corporate Executive Board. When he was 35, Fortune estimated his net worth at $149 million. He currently heads the Cranemere Group, a holding company on the model of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Zients today, at 53, is a major fundraising bundler for Biden, and is said by multiple sources to want a top economic post in his administration.Bruce Reed. Biden insiders say he is in charge of the campaign's policy operation. Reed, who turns 60 this month, is personally close to the former vice president. He was Biden's chief of staff between 2011 and 2013. Before that, he epitomized the right wing of the Clinton and Obama administrations. He was head of the Democratic Leadership Council; he directed Clinton's Domestic Policy Council, and was a key author of the Clinton welfare reform that led to the protest resignations of three subcabinet officials. Under Obama, he was executive director of the pro-austerity Bowles-Simpson Commission. He co-authored a 2006 book with Rahm Emanuel titled The Plan: Big Ideas for America. In short, everything you don't want in a Biden administration, but a contender for a major role.Other Wall Street worthies often mentioned as possible top Biden economic officials are Tom Nides, vice chair and managing director of Morgan Stanley, and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Mike Bloomberg has just about everything he wants (except the presidency), but given his key roles in both endorsing and bankrolling Biden, if he wants to top his career as, say, head of the World Bank or even chair of the Fed, it could be hard for Biden to refuse.Some lesser names include Sarah Bianchi, an Obama veteran who worked at BlackRock and lobbied for Airbnb, and had a hand in Biden's health care policy. She's currently a managing director at bank advisory firm Evercore. Terrell McSweeny, who rotated from the Federal Trade Commission to top corporate law firm Covington ...rling, has also been a key Biden adviser. Austan Goolsbee, who endorsed Pete Buttigieg in the primary, has plenty of Obama economic-team experience. And longtime Rubin aide Jason Furman, former chair of the Obama Council of Economic Advisers now teaching at Harvard and a close collaborator of Summers, is said to want in.A good rule of thumb is that nobody who has spent much of their career at the largest banks or hedge funds\u2014Morgan Stanley, Citi, Goldman, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock\u2014should be considered for a top economic job in the next Democratic administration. We've had far too much experience of how that works out. By the same token, as antitrust enforcement belatedly begins to catch up with the big-tech platform monopolies, people from the executive/lobbyist/bundler world of Silicon Valley, and their academic allies, should be kept out as well. Biden has always viewed himself as a mainstream Democrat. To the extent that Wall Street dominance of all the key economic posts has been all too mainstream under both Clinton and Obama, we are in big trouble if Biden looks to that mainstream.WHO OR WHAT might save America from this fate? One possible counterweight is Ted Kaufman, Biden's longtime chief of staff, who replaced Biden in the Senate for two years when Biden became vice president in 2009. Kaufman is more committed to regulating Wall Street than his boss, and, liberated from Delaware's financial elite by promising never to run for re-election, he played a surprising and important role in the financial-reform debate. Working closely with progressives Sherrod Brown, Pat Leahy, Elizabeth Warren, and others, he urged a much tougher stance by the SEC, secured successful anti-fraud legislation, and introduced the Brown-Kaufman amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which would have limited the size of large banks (it failed).Kaufman remains close to Biden. He helped organize his 2020 run for the presidency. If anyone can serve as an internal firebreak against a Wall Street takeover, it's him. Kaufman turns 81 this month, though he is said to be all there cognitively, and he remains in the inner circle.The most important possible firebreak is Elizabeth Warren, who has a decent personal relationship with Biden. They even discussed teaming up as a ticket in 2016. When Warren went after Bloomberg, Amy Klobuchar, and Pete Buttigieg full throttle in her final debates, she largely spared Biden.Some in the Biden camp, flush with victory, conclude that he can win the presidency without accommodating Bernie Sanders, Warren, or their supporters. But there are now millions of very unhappy Democratic voters. They did not support Sanders because they liked his Brooklyn accent, or Warren because of those cute selfies. They supported progressives because economic life is going to hell in America for ordinary people. Health security, relief from student debt, decent jobs at decent wages\u2014these are not just ideological fancies but life concerns that will not go away just because Joe Biden is the nominee. And with the coronavirus epidemic, life prospects just got worse.Whether or not he and his handlers know it yet, Biden will need the support of disaffected progressives in November. One of Warren's favorite expressions is 'Personnel is policy.' If ever that aphorism applied, it applies in 2020. Warren is in a position to broker the deal she attempted with Hillary Clinton in 2016: If Biden appoints more progressives and pursues more progressive policies, both Sanders and Warren will vigorously campaign for the ticket and urge their supporters to turn out.Alternatively, Biden could strong-arm progressives and appoint the third succession of Wall Street Democrats. And even if he managed to win election, business as usual would just seed more right-wing nationalism.

On the technology front, the big news was IBM's new \"Personal Computer\" and for those inclined to work with numbers, Lotus 1-2-3, a \"spreadsheet\" that could be used to automate virtually any analytical exercise. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the planning side, the College for Financial Planning was nearly 10 years old. But more importantly, in just one decade, its curriculum had presented the possibility of creating a new profession-like law or medicine-based on financial knowledge and advice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In the early 1980s, a high-tech advisory practice consisted of an office with one or two non-networked PCs running 640K RAM (random access memory), a 10MB hard drive and copies of Lotus and Word Perfect. Users needed to master the cryptic language of DOS in order to navigate through file directories, each with a name limited in length to eight or fewer characters. The Internet was nowhere in sight. (It had, by then, been invented, but still ahead of  then-Sen. Al Gore's influence, was not yet in widespread use.)</p><p>Our industry's use of technology was confined mainly to writing letters to clients on a computer screen, where they could be corrected before printing-an upscale version of an electric typewriter.  Some of us were even using spreadsheets to calculate the present value of the income stream we guessed a client would need in retirement.</p><p>Personally, I'm happy to have lived through this period. It's been exciting to watch my own work as a financial guy take me from the days of legal pads and HP 12C hand-held calculators to Core Duo processors and beyond. Yet with all of today's advanced technology and dramatically heightened productivity comes the requirement to climb a never-ending learning curve while protecting our flanks from security threats never anticipated almost three decades ago.</p><p>And that's why 2008 brings us a new set of challenges-five big tech trends you should be aware of and on top of to keep your shop up-to-speed: Client Portals, Remote Computing, Rebalancing Software, Software Integration and Security.</p><p>Client Portals</p><p>Client portals are nothing new, but the direction in which they are changing is.</p><p>First made possible by companies producing Web sites for financial advisors-companies like AdvisorProducts Inc. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.advisorproducts.com\">www.advisorproducts.com</url>) and Lightport, Inc. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lightport.com\">www.lightport.com</url>)-most advisors thought a client portal consisted of a page on their Web site that permitted password-protected entrance to clients enabling them to link to the Web site of a custodian-like Schwab or Fidelity-and view their latest portfolio balance. Considering all of our current technological opportunities, this now seems an unambitious usage, at best. However, savvy advisors are finding new ways to squeeze as much value as possible from their client portals.</p><p>Today, clients can access not only investment holdings, but all manner of financial information customized to their needs and desires. For example, Jordan Dechtman of Jordan Dechtman Wealth Management in Englewood, Colo. employs what he calls \"Wealth Check,\" a system made available to him by Securities America, his broker/dealer. \"The design is structured so that it is 'One Click, One View, and Total Access' to our client's entire financial picture,\" explains Dechtman. \"Wealth Check provides one-click online access to all of their important financial information, including bank, investment, credit card and other accounts,\" he adds.</p><p>Expanding the breadth of financial information captured within a client portal is valuable, of course, but there is even more the client can do. \"Wealth Check offers document storage for such items as clients' tax returns, personal records and legal documents-wills, marriage certificates, birth certificates-in a secure, paperless environment. It also gives clients the ability to run reports of their entire financial picture-updated and refreshed each day.\"</p><p>Build it and they will come-maybe. Kenny Landgraf, president and founder of Kenjol Capital Management LLC in Austin, Texas says, \"Attempts to give clients a portal have been disappointing. Most clients will log on to Fidelity.com, but when we have attempted to set up a client-specific site, we end up doing a lot of work for very minimal use.\"</p><p>Yet, Dechtman reports a different experience: \"We have had tremendous feedback with this added value service. Our older clientele travels quite a bit, and they have told us how valuable this tool is in tracking their data and ultimately being able to share information with other family members and advisors who need access to it.\"</p><p>When clients of Huff, Stuart &amp; Carlton in Forest, Va. sign onto their portals on the firm's Web site, they see their photo, address, phone numbers and email addresses, with the flexibility to update this information. They also gain access to a file cabinet where they can find folders containing quarterly performance reports, copies of their tax returns, their estate planning documents, their Investment Policy Statement and folders for other random information like credit card numbers. </p><p>\"These are on our server,\" says Rick Huff, \"so we know the data is secure.\" Do clients use it? \"Feedback has been very good, and about 60 percent of our clients use it in varying frequencies. For example, the daughter of a single client used it recently to retrieve an Advanced Medical Directive when her mother was hospitalized while traveling. We continue to inform and remind our clients of its availability.\"</p><p>J. Patrick Collins Jr., a principal with Greenspring Wealth Management, Inc. in Towson, Md., says his firm created its own client portal dubbed MyGreenspring using Microsoft's Sharepoint program. \"MyGreenspring is meant to be collaborative,\" Collins explains. With the client's permission, we give access to his CPA, attorney, insurance agent, etc. These professionals then have the ability to upload new documents or work on old documents in the client folder. Finally, we send an email to all interested parties when a new document is uploaded or modified.\"</p><p>In time, client portals will come to be appreciated by advisors much as email has. Just as email has proven its value by reducing time wasted in lengthy phone calls with clients and associates-while maintaining a written record of their communications-client portals will relieve staff members of much of the time-intensive and costly client hand-holding that goes on in any financial planning practice. </p><p>Remote Computing</p><p>Remote computing used to mean taking work home on your notebook computer, a device that wasn't even widely available until the late 1980s.</p><p>Now, it means working at a distance from the source of one's data, whether the data are stored on a company server across town or the server of a hosting entity halfway around the world. Says George Papadopoulos, CPA/PFS, CFP, a Novi, Mich. advisor: \"I took my family to Europe for three weeks this summer. I had with me a USB mini-drive with my RoboForm2Go (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.roboform.com\">www.roboform.com</url>) software loaded with all my passwords. There are plenty of Internet cafes everywhere, so I was able to pop in my mini-drive, log into GoToMyPC (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gotomypc.com\">www.gotomypc.com</url>), and use my desktop computer at my home office. It worked wonderfully, and I didn't have to haul my laptop and cords with me.\"</p><p>Whether traveling on vacation, living in a foreign country for six months of the year, or just working from home on a Friday afternoon, remote computing is a trend that can only grow. It has taken forever, but many corners of the business world now accept the fact that employees can maintain (and even enhance) their productivity working outside the office, away from the constant gaze of their supervisors.</p><p>Joyce Smith Cole's planning niche-horse owners-requires that she spend the winter months in Ocala, Fla., away from her horse farm in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. \"I work from my Living Quarter Exiss trailer which is tricked out with sleeping and cooking accommodations, water, electric, and bathing amenities. If I don't have an electric hookup at the site, I have a generator to power FM radio, TV, CD player, cooking, pumps and computer. I have a mini-office setup in it so I can work every day, fielding client calls by cell phone and computing via Verizon Broadband wireless on my Dell XPS M1210.\"</p><p>Frank Moore, of Vintage Financial Services LLC in Ann Arbor, Mich., spent 10 weeks at his Lake Michigan beach house last summer plus three weeks at conferences and another three weeks on vacations. Moore keeps in touch with staff back at the office with AOL Instant Messenger from his laptop, and CentralDesktop (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.centraldesktop.com\">www.centraldesktop.com</url>), a collaborative online site that allows employees-wherever they may be-to share the latest news on clients, lists and status of prospects, folders for company files like vacation policy and other information used daily. \"We use Central Desktop's calendar to schedule vacation time and conference room use, among other things,\" says Moore.</p><p>The point being: We are no longer chained to our desks (and, if you are, it's your own fault). Whether you're a firm owner or an employee, remote computing capabilities will be tried and used because they are what's allowing us to spend more time with our families and non-work interests while still taking care of our clients. With remote computing, we can have a life.</p><p>Rebalancing Software</p><p>Traditionally, one of an investment advisor's greatest inefficiencies has been the rebalancing process. Commonly used portfolio management software products like Advent and Centerpiece, as well as the major custodian trading platforms, have failed to address this gap in the management process-a gap that has been particularly resistant to modernization.</p><p>Good software in this niche is not inexpensive, either: iRebal (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.irebal.com\">www.irebal.com</url>), for instance, costs a minimum of $50,000-with a $10,000 setup fee. Yet advisors in all but the smallest of operations are realizing that $50,000 isn't much compared to the personnel time they can save. Michael Kitces, director of financial planning for Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md. says, \"iRebal allows us to execute our entire trading strategy in a way that's both radically more efficient and higher value for our clients for whom we're able to get better execution.\" The firm's senior portfolio analyst, Rick Vollaro, adds, \"iRebal lets us manage our entire trading operation-involving 550 clients [and all their accounts]-with just one employee. Before iRebal, we had three full-time traders and still had instances when a full block trade for a portfolio change could take a week or more, depending on how complicated it was.\"</p><p>Those who can't afford an iRebal, but have the skills to develop their own rebalancing systems, will do so to advantage. That's the approach Rich Chambers of Investor's Capital Management in Menlo Park, Calif. took when he developed his own rebalancing system. \"Our program makes viewing a client's asset allocation easy and error free. For example, when a client adds $10,000 to one of their accounts, using the program makes it possible to quickly view the current asset allocation across all client accounts, decide which asset classes need the cash, enter the trades, and upload and submit the trades in less than five minutes. Without the program, it would take us 30 to 45 minutes and be far more error prone.\"</p><p>Thus, this one efficiency \"hole\"-the need for seriously labor-intensive efforts to periodically rebalance client portfolios-will be addressed by more advisory firms, if not by iRebal, then with products like Tamarac (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tamaracinc.com\">www.tamaracinc.com</url>), or eAllocator, developed by Joel Javer, a principal at Sharkey, Howes and Javer in Denver, or other homegrown systems.</p><p>Software Integration</p><p>The history of software integration highlights our industry's greatest area of technological inefficiency-one that transcends even those long-needed rebalancing systems.</p><p>We don't know if all industries struggle with this problem, but the need to enter duplicative information in multiple software systems or, conversely, the inability of our key software products to \"talk to each other\" has persisted for almost 30 years. Finally we're seeing a change.</p><p>Two strategies are possible, and both are being pursued by a community of software developers. The first-the all-in-one, do-everything system-is exemplified by Solution 360O by Interactive Advisory Software (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iassoftware.com\">www.iassoftware.com</url>). IAS, as it is referred to simply by most advisors, brings together financial planning, portfolio management and client relationship management capabilities in one, Web-based, very compelling system.</p><p>What happens, though, if you already use software for one or more of these functions that contains many years and millions of bytes of client information, and handles it-you believe-in a manner superior to anything else on the market? Then you urge the software's developer to do what's necessary to integrate that software with other products you don't care to abandon.</p><p>Javer, developer of the eAllocator rebalancing system, also uses Junxure for CRM and dbCAMS for portfolio reporting. \"Both of these products are 'Silver Bullet' participants. The integration [of these products] allows us to view client portfolios and accounts in Junxure, which is a big help for our staff,\" Javer points out.</p><p>The \"Silver Bullet\" to which Javer refers is actually the YourSilverBullet (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yoursilverbullet.net\">www.yoursilverbullet.net</url>) consortium of 22 independent software companies and custodians that joined together in March 2007 to carry out the mission it describes as giving you \"...the freedom to select the best software for each of your core applications from different vendors without paying the price of repetitive data entry and system incompatibility\" and \"to make our separate programs 'play well' together so that you can spend more of your time managing your client's money and not managing incompatible software.\" (For more on this venture, see \"Hi-Yo Silver\" on p. 42.)</p><p>Integration has been a perennial challenge for our industry. Now we have the tools and choices to achieve integration at a much higher level than ever before possible. And the benefits will be obvious in your bottom line.</p><p>Security</p><p>We said it in the beginning of this article: Thanks to all the new capabilities we have, we now must spend commensurately more time protecting ourselves from security threats that-without the Internet-were much less of an issue in the early 1980s when the first PCs arrived. Security is the overarching issue that encompasses the other items. </p><p>Think \"disaster plan.\" Required by regulators and dictated by common sense, an advisory firm owner must now know exactly what she and her team will do if their office burns to the ground. In fact, what would you do? Devise a plan and, better yet, stage a drill. Call your employees early one morning, have them pretend the office no longer exists, and tell them to carry out the firm's disaster plan.</p><p>Don't have one? Then you expose yourself to downtime, at best, and lawsuits at worst, when client data is leaked all over the Internet. Don't know where to start? Start where most advisors do with the hiring of a reputable, outside IT consultant-practically a necessity in today's complex computing environment-even for the smallest advisors.</p><p>In conclusion, this year's five tech trends are \"big\" because they either help us cut operating expenses, augment our lifestyles or prevent costly accidents. And if they make you groan instead of grin, I've got a circa 1981 Osborne computer I might be willing to let go. </p><p>An independent financial advisor since 1981, David J.
