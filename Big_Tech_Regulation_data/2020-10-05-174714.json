The stock was essentially flat on Thursday as the market assessed the fallout.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the start of the year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a Jan. 4 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571\">post</url> that his \"personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing\" issues       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/spotify-claims-unaware-facebook-personal-user-data-1203093009/\">Facebook</url> was wrestling with, including \"defending against interference by nation states.\" Instead, 2018 has delivered a steady drumbeat of public failings for Facebook, with Zuckerberg and his company under more scrutiny than ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a summary of the scope of the problems Facebook is dealing with and what's likely to happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What happened this week?</p><p>Washington, D.C.'s <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/d-c-attorney-general-sues-facebook-over-data-misuse-in-2016-election-1203093256/\">attorney general sued Facebook</url>\u00a0on Wednesday, alleging the company failed to protect the private data of millions of users that wound up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that used the information\u00a0to target voters during the 2016 presidential election. That came less than a day after a damaging       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html?module=inline\">report by the New York Times</url>, which alleged Facebook has given large tech partners, including Microsoft and Amazon, data on hundreds of millions of users each month, including email addresses and phone numbers - which those partners were able to access without users' knowledge or consent, according to the Times.</p><p>How big a deal are the revelations that Facebook gave big partners extensive access to user data, including the ability for some to write and delete private messages?</p><p>Facebook is downplaying them, but the new information has renewed calls for more comprehensive U.S.<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/hearst-data-privacy-50-million-lawsuit-settlement-1202872741/\">privacy</url> legislation and could fuel the Federal Trade Commission's probe into whether the company violated its consumer-privacy deal with the agency. Facebook says many of the data deals documented in most recent Times report have expired, while it is pledging to review \"all our APIs and the partners who can access them,\" Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, director of developer platforms and programs, wrote in a blog post. The company also claims that it never granted access to user data without the permission of its users.</p><p>On the issue of letting partners like Netflix and Spotify<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-netflix-user-messages-access-privacy-1203093053/\">access Facebook users' messages</url>, Facebook essentially says that this has been overblown.\u00a0By necessity, Facebook had to enable read/write/delete access for those partners to Messenger accounts of users who had opted-in to the features in order to make those integrations possible. \"These experiences are common in our industry - think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud or to read your email on Apple's Mail app,\" VP of product partnerships Ime Archibong wrote in a blog post response Wednesday. At the same time, Facebook noted, those messaging features have been discontinued.</p><p>How do the latest issues compound what came to light earlier in 2018?</p><p>They reinforce a string of negative headlines and disclosures about the company's business practices and security breaches that have rattled Facebook. Those include:</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal: After news reports in March that Facebook user data was improperly obtained by the U.K.-based political consulting firm, <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-87-million-users-cambridge-analytica-leak-1202743952/\">Facebook disclosed that info on up to 87 million users</url> was actually in the possession of Cambridge Analytica, which       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/cambridge-analytica-facebook-shut-down-1202795461/\">subsequently shut down</url>.In May,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-suspends-200-apps-user-data-cambridge-analytica-1202809483/\">Facebook suspended 200 apps</url>\u00a0that had access to large amounts of user data prior to 2014, as part of its efforts to clean up the mess from the Cambridge Analytica situation.In June, Facebook confirmed it had data-sharing agreements with Chinese manufacturers including Huawei Technologies and Lenovo, which granted the device makers special access to user data. In response, Facebook noted that it was already winding down\u00a0access to such partners. It also said the program was launched a decade ago when app developers (including Twitter and YouTube) \"had to work directly with operating system and device manufacturers to get their products into people's hands,\" according to Facebook's Archibong.In August,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-iran-russia-disinformation-1202913071/\">Facebook said it identified and removed several hundred pages and accounts</url> associated with Iranian state media. The company said it also\u00a0removed content associated with Russian intelligence services and a group of accounts associated with Middle East media organizations that acted in concert while pretending to represent independent entities.In September,\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-security-breach-1202961260/\">Facebook announced the biggest hack</url>\u00a0in its history after it discovered a security hole had compromised up to 50 million user accounts. The company later said hackers had\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-security-breach-1202961260/\">successfully accessed data from 29 million\u00a0Facebook\u00a0members</url>.In November, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-crisis-pr-soros-conspiracy-1203028891/\">New York Times investigative report</url> detailed\u00a0Facebook's response to scandals over misuse of its platform and data-privacy gaffes, including that it withheld knowledge of Russia's weaponizing the platform to spread propaganda. It also revealed that Facebook hired a D.C.-area political consulting firm to push negative coverage of competitors and critics - including urging journalists to investigate ties between billionaire financier George Soros and anti-Facebook groups.In early December, a U.K. parliamentary committee released a 250-page report, which included numerous internal company emails, detailing how\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-user-data-competitive-weapon-uk-documents-1203081288/\">Facebook granted favored partners including Netflix \"whitelist\" access to user info</url>\u00a0while it blocked rivals from accessing its data. (Facebook said the documents, obtained through an app developer's 2015 lawsuit against the company, were \"cherry-picked\" and lacked context.)Facebook last week (Dec. 14) disclosed that it had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebooks-privacy-bug-photos-exposed-1203089896/\">discovered a bug in photo-sharing system</url> that may have exposed the private photos of as many as 6.8 million users. (It said it fixed the bug and was notifying affected users.)</p><p>Is Facebook going to face other regulatory or legal repercussions?</p><p>Besides the D.C. attorney general's lawsuit, other government actions are growing more probable with every new revelation. The year of \"bad publicity and significant issues\" for Facebook makes it \"more likely that the U.S. government will take action to penalize and/or regulate FB,\" CFRA Research's Scott Kessler wrote in a Dec. 19 research note. At the same time, the analyst reiterated a \"buy\" rating on the company because \"we still see its fundamentals as healthy and valuation as attractive.\"</p><p>On Capitol Hill, both <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-data-cambridge-analytica/facebook-shares-drop-as-data-privacy-fallout-spreads-idUSKBN1OI241\">Democrat and Republican lawmakers</url>\u00a0this week criticized Facebook, with some questioning whether Zuckerberg lied in his testimony during congressional hearings earlier this year when he said Facebook had \"complete control\" over its data. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who serves on U.S. Senate committees including\u00a0Commerce, Science and Transportation,\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1075226630740680704\">tweeted</url>\u00a0Tuesday, \"It has never been more clear. We need a federal privacy law. [Facebook is] never going to volunteer to do the right thing. The FTC needs to be empowered to oversee big tech.\" Analysts expect the U.S. to adopt legislation similar to Europe's\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation; Zuckerberg has said       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-gdrp-commitment-1202744089/\">Facebook will apply GDPR-compliant controls worldwide</url>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FTC initiated its\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-ftc-probe-privacy-practices-stock-price-1202736199/\">investigation into Facebook's privacy practices this spring</url>, which remains ongoing. The agency is expected to specifically examine whether Facebook violated the terms of its agreement with the FTC, approved in 2012, under which Facebook is required to give consumers \"clear and prominent notice\" and must obtain \"their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.\" (Facebook insists that none of its data-sharing partnerships violated the FTC agreement.) The FTC has the authority to impose fines on Facebook, which Facebook would have the right to appeal. The agency also may seek additional restrictions on the company's data-handling practices.</p><p>Are heads going to roll at Facebook because of these scandals?</p><p>It doesn't seem like anything will change on the senior-management front right now. Despite calls from some investors for Zuckerberg to step aside, when asked in a CNN interview last month if he was going to <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-chairman-resign-1203033452/\">resign as chairman</url>, he said \"That's not the plan.\" (Because he\u00a0controls 60% of the voting shares in Facebook, only Zuckerberg can decide to exit.) COO Sheryl Sandberg - who acknowledged that she directed Facebook's communications staff to look into Soros' financial interests after Soros called internet companies like Facebook \"a menace to society\" - has the support of the board (which includes, of course, Zuckerberg as well as Sandberg).</p><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0Elliot Schrage, Facebook's\u00a0longtime VP of communications and public policy who was already set to leave the company, in a memo just before Thanksgiving <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-chairman-resign-1203033452/\">took the blame for hiring Definers</url>, the political consulting firm that tried to push journalists to look into Soros' backing of Facebook critics.</p><p>Is Facebook going to see a drop in users?</p><p>It's unclear how big an impact the ongoing privacy problems are having on Facebook's user growth. Immediately after the Cambridge Analytica erupted in public, Facebook actually <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/deletefacebook-didnt-happen-facebook-grows-users-in-q1-despite-privacy-backlash-beats-earnings-estimates-1202786867/\">boosted its daily active users in the U.S. and Canada</url>. But in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-q2-earnings-1202884337/\">Q2</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-q3-2018-earnings-1203015204/\">Q3</url>,\u00a0daily active users have effectively been flat in the U.S. - and have dropped in Europe. Partly, the leveling-off of growth is because Facebook is already so massive it doesn't have more runway to add more users. But privacy concerns clearly don't help.</p><p>Is the privacy of Facebook users at risk?</p><p>Facebook says it's doing everything it can to safeguard user data and remediate holes in its systems - but given its privacy track record, an increasing number of users are likely to either cancel their accounts, reduce their usage, or more tightly restrict their privacy settings. Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-privacy-controls-delete-data-1202738091/\">introduced new privacy tools this year</url>, designed to consolidate controls that were previously in separate places.

In recent weeks light has been shed on how operatives linked to Russia continue to try to fuel US culture wars by using social media to spread racially divisive content.</p><p>Facebook and Google have revealed that entities linked to Russia bought advertising on their platforms, apparently to try to sway the race for the White House. Twitter has deleted about 200 Russia-linked bogus accounts, a number that experts say is only a tiny part of the problem.</p><p>However, social media giants have simultaneously been fighting proposed legislation that would make them liable for content posted on their sites by users, a move that could upend the business model in which a small workforce drives immense profits.</p><p>Democrats in the Senate have pushed a bill to force social media companies to disclose more information about the political advertising they run. \"We must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them,\" Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, said.</p><p>Facebook plans to recruit 1,000 staff to vet the adverts it promotes. Google, Twitter and Facebook have hired an army of crisis managers, image consulting companies and lobbyists.

Silicon Valley's efforts to shape policy in Washington have grown steadily in recent years.</p><p>In 2014 Google made waves when it surpassed Goldman Sachs on political spending, donating $1.43 million. ?

Hours before <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg, </nameText></person>its chief operating officer, arrived in Washington for meetings with members of Congress and journalists last night, the company said that it spent more than $5.6 million on lobbyists in the first half of the year.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's billionaire chief executive, has also taken to calling members of Congress directly, the Bloomberg news website said. The increased spending comes as Silicon Valley's \"Big Tech\" companies come under mounting pressure to explain their role in the most unpredictable presidential election in modern history. In recent weeks light has been shed on how operatives linked to Russia continue to try to fuel US culture wars by using social media to spread racially divisive content.</p><p>Facebook and Google have revealed that entities linked to Russia bought advertising on their platforms, apparently to try to sway the race for the White House. Twitter has deleted about 200 Russia-linked bogus accounts, a number that experts say is only a tiny part of the problem.</p><p>However, social media giants have simultaneously been fighting proposed legislation that would make them liable for content posted on their sites by users, a move that could upend the business model in which a small workforce drives immense profits.</p><p>Democrats in the Senate have pushed a bill to force social media companies to disclose more information about the political advertising they run. \"We must update our laws to ensure that when political ads are sold online Americans know who paid for them,\" Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, said.</p><p>Facebook plans to recruit 1,000 staff to vet the adverts it promotes. Google, Twitter and Facebook have hired an army of crisis managers, image consulting companies and lobbyists. Executives have been asked to testify before Congress next month as part of the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the election.</p><p>Last November Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had dismissed the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election, only to apologise last month, saying that he had being too dismissive of that possibility. Silicon Valley's effort to shape policy in Washington have grown steadily in recent years.</p><p>In 2014 Google made waves when it surpassed Goldman Sachs on political spending, donating $1.43 million.</p><p>Google was recently accused of trying to use its financial muscle to influence policy research. An expert on market competition alleged that he was sacked by the New America think-tank after he called for the US to follow Europe's lead and crack down on internet monopolies. Google has been a large funder of New America.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-130523256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PP9-JBM1-JBVM-Y3SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 12, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Scotland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The tool lets users of its network transfer photos and videos they have stored on its servers directly to another photo storage service, such as Google Photos, via encrypted transfer.</p><p><br/>A Facebook spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch that access to the transfer tool is being rolled out today to the U.K., the rest of the European Union and additional countries in Latin America and Africa.<br/>Late last month Facebook also opened access to multiple markets in APAC and LatAm, per the spokesman. The tech giant previously said the tool will be available worldwide in the first half of 2020.<br/>The setting to \"transfer a copy of your photos and videos\" is accessed via the Your Facebook Information settings menu.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The tool is based on code developed via Facebook's participation in the Data Transfer Project (DTP) - a collaborative effort starting in 2018 and backed by the likes of Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter - which committed to build a common framework using open-source code for connecting any two online service providers in order to support \"seamless, direct, user initiated portability of data between the two platforms.\"<br/>In recent years the dominance of tech giants has led to an increase in competition complaints - garnering the attention of policymakers and regulators.<br/>In the EU, for instance, competition regulators are now eyeing the data practices of tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook and Google. While, in the U.S., tech giants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, are also facing antitrust scrutiny. And as more questions are being asked about antitrust, big tech has been under pressure to respond - hence the collective push on portability.<br/>Last September Facebook also released a white paper laying out its thinking on data portability, which seeks to frame it as a challenge to privacy - in what looks like an attempt to lobby for a regulatory moat to limit portability of the personal data mountain it's amassed on users.<br/>At the same time, the release of a portability tool gives Facebook something to point regulators to when they come calling - even as the tool only allows users to port a very small portion of the personal data the service holds on them. Such tools are also only likely to be sought out by the minority of more tech-savvy users.<br/>Facebook's transfer tool also currently only supports direct transfer to Google's cloud storage - greasing a pipe for users to pass a copy of their facial biometrics from one tech giant to another.<br/>We checked, and from our location in the EU, Google Photos is the only direct destination offered via Facebook's drop-down menu thus far:<br/>However the spokesman implied wider utility could be coming - saying the DTP project updated adapters for photos APIs from SmugMug (which owns Flickr); and added new integrations for music streaming service Deezer; decentralized social network Mastodon; and Tim Berners-Lee's decentralization project Solid.<br/>He said the adapters are on a per-data-type basis, noting that open-source contributors are working on adapters for a range of data types (such as photos, playlists and contacts) - and pointing to a list of projects in development available on GitHub.<br/>Though it's not entirely clear why there's no option offered as yet within Facebook to port direct to any of these other services. Presumably additional development work is still required by the third party to implement the direct data transfer. Asked about this the spokesman confirmed Google Photos is the only option for now, saying it's \"a first step\" which he claimed \"provides stakeholders with a tangible tool to assess while other companies join the DTP and we work toward transfers to different services and data types.\"<br/>The aim of the DTP is to develop a standardized version to make it easier for others to join without having to \"recreate the wheel every time they want to build portability tools,\" as the spokesman put it, adding: \"We built this tool with the support of current DTP partners, and hope that even more companies and partners will join us in the future.\"<br/>He also emphasized that the code is open source and claimed it's \"fairly straightforward\" for a company that wishes to plug its service into the framework, especially if they already have\u00a0 a public API.<br/>\"They just need to write a DTP adapter against that public API,\" he suggested.<br/>\"Now that the tool has launched, we look forward to working with even more experts and companies - especially startups and new platforms looking to provide an on-ramp for this type of service,\" the spokesman added.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-691688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDD-GTS1-JBYT-H2JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 12, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,' he said.</p><p>The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.</p><p>Also appearing on the BBC he said: 'He is technically wrong on that point which he should know.</p><p>'We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was - which they shared with us - on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.'</p><p>He added: 'There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and elsewhere.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-53916905</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-T1T1-F021-602W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1302\"/><timeReceived>7:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Just as regulators were beginning to wake up from their self-induced coma to discover that Facebook has grown too fast and too big for its own good, the company has decided to redouble its unbending commitment to \"moving fast and breaking things\". The good old days when Facebook was merely breaking privacy and elections are now gone - and we'll surely miss them. But how could they compete with the chance of breaking - once and for all - the global financial system?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To that end, Facebook has announced Libra, a currency, an infrastructure, a network - an ambiguous digital entity capacious enough to be everything for everybody, and with the noble cover of a.org domain to boot. It's the ultimate Schrodinger's cat of the digital economy: a blockchain/non-blockchain, it will serve as money/non-money to save/bury Facebook/all of us.</p><p>The specifics of how this amorphous project will operate are somewhat scarce but one can still discern its overall aspiration. It would enable users, especially those who are unfortunate enough to lack a bank account but fortunate enough to have a Facebook account, to convert real money into Libras, to deposit it virtually, to send it to others or to simply use it to pay for services.</p><p>Facebook is framing the venture as humanitarianism: Libra is here to help the world bank, not strip the world of its remaining assets. Thus, for every Uber and Mastercard that have joined Libra's association as partners (at the \"small\" cost of $10m per company - apparently, the era of \"free\" online stuff is over too), there are also not-for-profit groups like Mercy Corps and Women's World Banking that lend today's financial and digital capitalism a humane, even smiley face. Without this not-for-profit contingent, the Libra Association would look more like an innovation-friendly crime syndicate - just look at the total number of recent court cases involving Uber, Mastercard, and Facebook alone.</p><p>It's tempting to misread Facebook's move into finance as yet more proof of its infinite chutzpah and shortsighted arrogance. Is Libra just a clever way of spitting into the face of angry regulators? Where does Facebook find the courage to proclaim that it's going to work with policymakers in order to \"shape the regulatory environment\" in a way that is conducive to its needs? No sane regulator would like to be seen to be shaped by anyone in Facebook's orbit.</p><p>Facebook, however, is no novice to controversy and is probably less na\u00efve than the Libra manifesto might suggest. Sheryl Sandberg, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's second-in-command, is very familiar with the world of finance, having spent her early career at the US treasury under Larry Summers. Could it be that Zuckerberg actually has a plan?</p><p>Facebook is following a risky but rational two-pronged strategy. First, the company badly needs to diversify its business away from advertising. Second, it wants to pre-empt, as much as possible, some of the tougher regulatory measures that are likely to surface as the US presidential campaign goes into full swing later this year.</p><p>The diversification bit is straightforward: Facebook's Chinese competitors have already shown that payments and communications go together and produce a very profitable mix. Besides, the world's unbanked won't stay so forever; as things stand now, they are most likely to be served by China's tech giants, as Beijing expands the digital components of its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">One Belt, One Road</url> global strategy. Without a strong presence in payment services, Facebook would not be able to take on Tencent or Alibaba in foreign markets.</p><p>On the other hand, by taking on Chinese competitors directly, Facebook stands to curry favor with Donald Trump: a Facebook that is aggressively trying to undermine the global expansion of Chinese firms is a more important strategic asset to Washington than the pacifist Facebook of yesteryear. For the moment, a further intensification of the tech cold war is only good news for Facebook, as such heated rhetoric (and practice) would paralyze Washington's efforts to break it up.</p><p>But there's another rationale to Facebook's actions. As it prepares for the public battle over its future, the company seems to have grasped that its best weapon is to mobilize the exact kind of populism that has already allowed other Silicon Valley giants - especially Uber and Airbnb - to rally their users behind their anti-regulation campaigns.</p><p>By positioning their firm as a rebel force against mediocre bureaucrats and sluggish corporate incumbents, Facebook's strategists seek to convince the public that their company, an emancipatory force of universal disruption, is a victim of global conspiracy by crony politicians and lazy competitors. Given the boundless public animosity to banks and their regulators - topped only by animosity toward telecom firms - such arguments might even sound persuasive.</p><p>With the launch of Libra, Facebook might also be acknowledging, however subtly, that its business model will be changing soon. Remarkably, it has already quietly embraced the idea - once anathema in big tech circles - that user data is a commodity with a price tag on top. Thus, it has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">recently launched an app</url> that pays users in order to collect data about how they interact with the services and apps of its competitors. But what about the value of data that users generate while they use Facebook itself?</p><p>Facebook's long-term bet could very well be that a digital economy where data and digital services are completely commodified might be as profitable as the one where the imperatives of advertising help to keep that data non-commodified. Yes, Facebook would need to pay something to its users - but, in turn, it would also be able to charge them for its services. As long as all such transactions are conducted in a currency under its implicit control- and if Facebook succeeds in convincing its users that their data, on its own, has far less value than the services it supplies - it would not necessarily be such a bad outcome for the company. In fact, it's almost certainly better than the prospect of slicing up the company into smaller pieces on antitrust grounds.</p><p>If Facebook is prepared to embrace such a seemingly radical shift to payments and subscriptions, it would disarm many of its critics, who have been insisting that the reason to fear Facebook is precisely because it's too addicted to advertising and cannot embrace other models. But would a different Facebook - a champion of digital currencies - look any less threatening?</p><p>Perhaps Facebook's critics have misunderstood the nature of the threat. Facebook, along with Amazon, Alphabet, and a few others, present a problem that is fundamentally different from those of other industries.</p><p>As long as they traffic in data - and as long as data remains the lifeblood of democracy and economy alike - these firms will exercise disproportionate and undue influence over decisions that ought to be decided in parliaments, not in marketplaces. Whether they get to exercise it by extracting our data and showing us ads or by buying our data and selling us their services is not so important. A business model, however profitable, is never a sound foundation for robust democracy. For that, we have constitutions.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53880058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD3-V6J1-JCJY-G20J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1224\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

As it expands into other businesses like commerce, payments, and hardware, it's mostly sticking with that formula \u2014 convinced that \"free and ad-supported\" remains the best route to achieve massive scale and to deliver on its mission of connecting the world. Data: Visual Capitalist[1], Digiday[2], Microsoft's 10-K[3], Investopedia[4]; Note: Microsoft's product sales share includes services from their \"Productivity and Business Processes\" category; Chart: Andrew Witherspoon/Axios The big picture: Advertising as an industry has historically grown at roughly the same rate as the GDP, albeit a bit slower since the 2008 recession. </p><p>In order for Facebook to maintain its revenue growth rate, especially through a possible recession, it needs to quickly expand its addressable market through free products. It also needs to move into different types of advertising formats that help businesses reach consumers at different points during the sales process. For now, the company is not interested in products that create friction between businesses and consumers, like paywalls or memberships, because it thinks that will limit the growth of businesses that Facebook is depending on to buy ads on Facebook. Facebook's foray into payments, for example, isn't about the company ultimately becoming a payment processor, but about facilitating higher engagement between businesses and consumers. \"If we can serve more businesses and serve all of them well with free tools, then in time, they can grow, hire and support more communities. Some of them will advertise in time.\" Facebook Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer in an interview with Axios. Details: Facebook's business plan is to grow its consumer experience first, and then to slowly integrate advertising into emerging products like messaging, stories, marketplace, and video, if they make sense for ads down the line. It plans to keep its new payments feature free for users until adoption grows big enough that one day, it could make sense for the company to take a cut of transactions, similar to the way traditional payment vendors make money. The company is willing to wait a long time before throwing up any types of barriers around consumer engagement. For example, Facebook still has yet to meaningfully monetize many of its biggest acquisitions (Instagram is the notable exception). It's been five years since Facebook acquired WhatsApp and Oculus, but it's only just beginning to monetize messaging, and doesn't yet really monetize virtual reality. Facebook is continuously creating new ads and toolsto subsidize (and increase) the free interactions between businesses and consumers. For example, its \"Click to message ads\" appear in places like the Facebook News Feed, which lead to an advertiser's Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp profile instead of its website. Facebook wants own that direct relationship as much as possible.The company's new \"tabs,\" like MarketPlace and Watch, have also become advertising destinations. Facebook rolled out ads in Marketplace to help performance advertisers reach consumers looking to buy a specific item, similarly to search ads on Google, while video ads in Watch help brand advertisers expand their reputation. Between the lines: As the news feeds in Facebook's flagship app and Instagram are quickly filling up with ads, Facebook is facing growing pressure to turn up the revenue dial for new services and features. Facebook is aggressively working to grow its ads business in emerging products like Stories and messaging, which are growing quickly in terms of user engagement, yet offer cheaper ad rates than the main news feeds in its Facebook and Instagram apps.To do this, Facebook has created aggressive education campaigns to help businesses transition their advertising spend over to new formats, such as a \"Stories school\" to teach advertisers and ad-buying agencies about how to create ads for Stories specifically.It also needs to focus on selling more ads to businesses outside of North America. Facebook makes the majority of its revenue [5]off of selling ads to users in the U.S. and Canada, but its user growth in those countries has slowed dramatically. By the numbers: Facebook sees plenty of room to expand its ads businesses. Currently, the tech giant makes around $55 billion annual in ad revenue, compared to Google's $116 annual ad revenue.Google, like Facebook, makes most of its money off of advertising on free-ad supported products, like search, news, video, directions, maps, etc. Facebook currently estimates it has 140 million businesses operating on its platform globally, with 7 million advertisers across all of its family of apps. Be smart: The company acknowledges that it will face challenges in growing its ads business, particularly because of regulation. For example, Facebook's chief financial officer David Wehner warned[6] on the company's first quarter earnings call this year that Facebook could face \"headwinds\" on its ad-targeting business due to privacy concerns in 2019. The bottom line: Facebook's plan to grow its business is to make it easier to get more companies to grow their businesses on Facebook's back. If it gets them hooked on Facebook's platform for sales, the advertising market grows exponentially.

Wouldn't you know there's a catch?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Politicians have always been expeditious in their take-up of new techniques and technology to more effectively spread their message, so it should be no surprise that social media has become a powerful political tool. This week in Australia, Facebook is rolling out new measures to improve the transparency of political advertising in response to concerns about online misinformation and foreign interference.</p><p>For most big-tech companies, political advertising has become a hot potato issue since Russia was caught red-handed using social media to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. While US President Donald Trump often characterises critical coverage by the mainstream media as fake news, it is social media platforms that have become prolific forums for exaggerated, conspiratorial and fraudulent information that mostly goes unchecked.</p><p>While it has been slow to react, big-tech companies are starting to move. In the most dramatic change, late last year Twitter banned all political advertising from its platform. Google was unwilling to take the financial hit of a ban, instead focusing on restricting the ability to microtarget political ads. The targeting, which allowed political parties to direct ads to very specific voters based on political affiliation or interest, has been dramatically restricted to reduce polarisation and manipulation of voters.</p><p>It has been Facebook that has tied itself in knots over the issue. The recipient of the most political advertising dollars, it has made faltering attempts to make it more transparent by enforcing tougher disclosure rules. The changes this week in Australia, which are already in place in America, mean ads about politics, elections and social issues will need to be authorised by an Australia-based person whose identity will be verified by Facebook.</p><p>Ads will also have a public \"paid for by\" disclaimer linked to an account, page or organisation nominated by the advertiser and will be documented in a publicly accessible library that will detail the reach of the post, the money spent on it and demographic groups being targeted.</p><p>While these changes are to be commended, there is one very big flaw. Facebook has a strict policy on truth in advertising, but is unwilling to enforce that code on political ads. So if you are selling soap, you must ensure it is truthful, but if you are selling a political message, there is no such condition.</p><p>Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defends the decision, believing voters should be allowed to make the judgment of truth themselves and any attempt to crack down on it would be censorship. The reality is Facebook does not want to be in the business of having to fact-check whether thousands of political ads are true or not, a fraught space for any company. But the end result is a forum where political parties must self-regulate on what is truthful. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>At the last federal election, the Coalition ran a very effective social media campaign accusing Bill Shorten of wanting to introduce a death tax, a claim that was clearly false. At the previous election, in 2016, it was Labor which ran an effective social media campaign accusing Malcolm Turnbull of wanting to privatise Medicare. Again, not true.</p><p>The big-tech companies need to do better. In a world where political self-interest can put falsehoods before the facts, they need to set the bar higher on political discourse. Voters deserve to know the truth, no matter what the financial cost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520252401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF1-TJW1-JBJ7-N54P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><timeReceived>04:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Regulators have opened investigations into the power of companionship in social media. Even one of that giant's own founders has made arguments as to why the firm should be divided.</p><p><br/>Now, the world's largest social network has begun to change its behavior\u2014both preventively and defensively\u2014to address these threats.<br/>Late last year, Facebook interrupted talks for the acquisition of Houseparty, a Silicon Valley social network that specializes in video chats, for fear of raising antitrust concerns, according to two people who were aware of negotiations. Acquiring another social network was too risky because of Facebook's dominance in the market, these people said, who spoke on the condition that their identity was not revealed because the conversations were confidential.<br/>Facebook has also begun making internal changes that make it more difficult to fragment. The company has been intertwining facebook messaging systems Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and has reorganized departments in such a way that it is more evident that Facebook is at the forefront, two people said they heard about it. Executives have also worked to rename Instagram and WhatsApp to associate them more noticeably with Facebook.<br/>Now, social media changes are spawning a debate about whether a facebooker is more intertwined with Instagram and WhatsApp is just an efficient business or helps strengthen potential anti-competitive practices. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, has repeatedly said that his company has competition on all sides and is reluctant to accept a fragmented version of the social media giant. You don't want to lose Instagram or WhatsApp, which are huge and have the ability to keep driving Facebook's $56 billion business.<br/>\"The big question is whether this is a logical business plan,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in the Obama administration and senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a nonprofit research center in Washington. \"For a social network with huge growth in photography and messaging services, there may be a major business justification for combining units.\"<br/>However, Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the House's antitrust subcommittee, noted that Facebook's movements had to be scrutinized.<br/>\"The combination of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp on the largest communications platform in history is a clear attempt to circumvent the effective application of antitrust rules by making it difficult to fragment the company,\" he said. \"We have to press the pause button.\"<br/>Defensive tactic?<br/>Facebook has rejected the idea that the company's movements\u2014especially when it comes to private messaging\u2014are a tactic of defense against possible fragmentation.<br/>\"Creating more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been aimed at generating benefits for people, simply and simply,\" said Stan Chudnovsky, a Facebook vice president in charge of oversight courier service. \"People want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.\"<br/>In Washington, Facebook is particularly mindful of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the agency that is investigating it for anti-competitive practices, two people with knowledge of this network said.Social.<br/>The FTC was interested in examining Facebook and its power last year when Facebook's investigators were analyzing the company separately for privacy violations, two people close to this process said. At the time, FTC researchers discovered internal Facebook documents that raised concerns about how the company was acquiring competing companies, commented.<br/>Facebook's long-running procurement series - bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, among many others - has been singled out by academics and lawmakers for decreasing competition. They have argued that the company made \"serial defensive acquisitions\" to protect its predominant position on social media.<br/>\"In Washington, Facebook is particularly attentive to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the agency that is investigating it for anti-competitive practices.\"<br/>This year, the FTC requested authorization from the Department of Justice to open an antitrust investigation over Facebook's potentially anti-competitive behavior, people close to the process. The FTC was granted the authorization and reported to Facebook in June. By the end of July, the agency had contacted at least six founders of companies that had been bought by Facebook in the last fifteen years to obtain information on their procurement practices, four people with knowledge of these inquiries.<br/>Around the time the FTC's activity in relation to Facebook increased, the company also reversed at least one possible acquisition.<br/>Last December, Facebook executives were making progress in conversations to buy Houseparty, a social media app that allows group video calls from cell phones, mentioned two people who knew about the Conversations. Houseparty, founded in 2016 by a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Ben Rubin, was very successful especially with people under the age of 24. Facebook, whose members are getting older, has wanted to have younger users.<br/>However, according to these people, after weeks of negotiations, Facebook's business development team halted conversations with Houseparty. Houseparty executives were told the deal would lead to unwanted scrutiny from Facebook by the federal government, they commented. Later, Epic Games, the manufacturers of the Fortnite video game, bought Houseparty.<br/>Copyright Group of Diarios Am\u00e9rica - GDA/La Nacion/Costa Rica<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8238921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWJ-B2C1-DY1R-B41H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yes, the social network eached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that ends a broad probe into its privacy practices. But hours after that announcement, Facebook confirmed in its quarterly earnings report that the FTC has opened another formal investigation, this time into antitrust concerns. The probe is in addition to a broad antitrust review of the tech giants that the Justice Department announced earlier this week, as well as a bipartisan House investigation into tech's power and impact on competition. </p><p>\"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\" told my colleagues earlier this week. But Facebook seems likely to prove resilient despite unprecedented political pressure and record-breaking fines. The company's stock soared as it posted strong earnings - on the same day it announced the antitrust probe, a historic $5 billion settlement with the FTC with new limitations on its business and a $100 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The stark contrast underscores how Wall Street has been unfazed by Washington's efforts to rein in the social networking giant. And that's where the true test might be. The company has been able to continue to grow its business, reaching $16.9 billion in revenue last quarter, beating analyst estimates of $16.49 billion, despite the compounding political headaches in Washington. \"It's a balancing act for Zuckerberg and Facebook to navigate this, because investors want to see growth and profitability,\" Daniel Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush, told The Washington Post. \"But in terms of the stock, Facebook and Zuckerberg have been almost Teflon-like over the last two years,\" Ives continued. \"And as long as they continue to execute, all the other issues . . . will become background noise.\" The stock's resilience has stoked fears in Washington that federal regulators are not doing enough to hold the company to account. Congressional Democrats and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., both blasted the FTC's settlement with Facebook yesterday, arguing that it did not place enough limitations on Facebook's business practices. There are growing concerns that the agency doesn't have the resources or the will to police tech giants in a meaningful way, even as it becomes more aggressive in opening investigations into these companies. Hawley said that yesterday's FTC settlement with Facebook amounted to a \"parking ticket\" that \"will not deter them in any way.\" \"I dont have a lot of confidence in the FTC even if they had an actionable claim,\" he said. \"They would act push for and show the tenacity and the guts to bring it because frankly they havent done it to date.\" The FTC's antitrust probe of Facebook will be a new test of the agency's power at a time when some are questioning if it should have oversight over Big Tech. \"It's not clear to me whether they need more budget, more staff,\" Hawley told Tony. \"I'm wondering whether we need to reassign their jurisdiction to another agency.\" Some tech policy experts who were disappointed by the FTC's settlement with Facebook over its privacy practices saw the new antitrust probe as a \"silver lining.\" Ashkan Soltani, a former FTC chief technologist, said:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press/April 11, 2018 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pauses while testifying before a House Energy and Commerce hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big technology under fire this morning, Facebook's proposed crypto currency came under attack yesterday on the Hill and the conversation continues as lawmakers demand more regulation of tech giants, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, questioning if they need to even be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are flat, take a look at futures indicating a higher opening for the broader averages. Now we're looking better here, but it's been back and forth in negative and positive territory.</p><p>DOW futures up 15, SMP futures up two points and the NASDAQ futures up by 10. Yesterday the record run took a pause, take a look at the market's performance at the close yesterday where the DOW is down 23, S&amp;P was down 10 points and the NASDAQ lower by 35.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are edging lower, take a look. FT 100 down 17, (inaudible) in Paris down eight and the DAX index in Germany lower by 17. In Asia overnight trade fears drove markets down across the board, it was a fractional move.</p><p>There is China trade uncertainty continuing, President Trump saying that there is still a long way to go before a deal happens between the U.S. and China. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross joined me earlier this morning saying that U.S. enforcement capability of any agreement made is a big ticket to any deal.</p><p>Earnings to focus on Wall Street this morning, Back of America beat on earnings and revenue, take a look at the stocks. This morning profits rising on loan growth, meanwhile in the pre-market, Abiave (ph) is down a fraction at $28.95, but IBM and Netflix are higher.</p><p>They are reporting after the bell tonight, and as you can see the numbers are higher going into those reports. Netflix up $1.63, that's one half of one percent. We'll bring you the analysis coming up before those numbers come out.</p><p>Then Beyond Meat lifting Blue Apron, the addition of the meat substitute cooking up big numbers for the food delivery services, I'll tell you about their partnership. All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell, former Home Depot CEO and Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli, and former Ohio state senator, minority leader and American University School of Public Affairs executive in residence Capri Cafaro.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Good to see everybody.</p><p>ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, HOME DEPOT: Been a great two hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's been a lot happening because it's always a busy period when earnings are coming out and we're right now at the beginning of the second quarter reporting season, Lindsey.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Right and the numbers have been coming out pretty good, 85 percent of companies have reported to date have beat on the bottom line, 75 percent beating on the top line.</p><p>Sales estimates by the way going into the quarter, 3.7 percent top line growth was the expectation, which is pretty low. It's a big deceleration from the last several quarters and I think that could be a big surprise, it's the upside which some benefits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the analysts are looking for a decline in earnings for this quarter, right?</p><p>BELL: Yes, looking for a decline of two percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're a little more positive than the consensus.</p><p>BELL: Right, so the consensus estimate is for a decline of two percent, I think we're going to come in better than that. They always come in better than that. So I think we'll see about two to 2.5 percent positive growth for the second quarter.</p><p>Third quarter has come down to just under a one percentage point decline, that'll probably see more pressure. And then the fourth quarter, we're looking for almost seven percent earnings growth, which definitely I think is a little bit out of whack right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So a nice bounce back by the end of the year. Joining the conversation this morning, Georgia Senator David Perdue is here. We will talk with Senator Perdue momentarily. Equity International founder and chairman and real estate billionaire investor Sam Zell joining us as well and the host of \"Varney &amp; Co.\" Stuart Varney weighing in also.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big hour right now. And we kick an hour off right here with big tech on the hill this morning, executives from Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, all grilled in the House and Senate yesterday.</p><p>Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with more. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Maria, good morning to you as well. It's not going to end there, because here we go again for Facebook later today as that company will get the chance once again to try to defend its plans to get into the crypto currency space as the head of Calibra will appear before the House Financial Services Committee later today. Yesterday that project drew immense scrutiny from members of the Senate Banking Committee, for example the Democratic senator from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, says that he's concerned it could become the next uncontrollable house fire for that company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might now intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they are playing with. Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the House over and over and called every arson a learning experience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The Senate Judiciary Committee also raised it's concerned with the major tech companies about issues of censorship and anti-trust. Google said that it competes for searches with Yelp, Amazon, and Travelocity while Facebook noted Snapchat but lawmakers were skeptical.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT PERAULT, HEAD OF GLOBAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT, FACEBOOK: Many of our competitors are sitting here at this table with me.</p><p>REP. HANK JOHNSON (D), G.A.: I think you're in a unique chair, in a unique position among those who are seated at the table.</p><p>PERAULT: There may not be an identical competitor to Facebook.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well I'd like to - off line I'd like to get a list from you so that I can do some shopping around myself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Maria, Yesterday President Trump also threw his support behind the idea from the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel that the FBI and the CIA should investigate Google to see whether or not that company has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.</p><p>In a statement yesterday, Google said it does not work with the Chinese military. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining me right now is Georgia senator, a member of the Senate Budget, Banking and Armed Services Committees David Perdue.</p><p>Senator Perdue, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA): Morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So can you really say that flat out, we do not work with the Chinese military when in fact the company is working with Chinese companies, state owned companies, the Chinese government.</p><p>And isn't their number one priority their military?</p><p>PERDUE: Well I lived over there, Maria, I've worked in China as one of your guests has - Mr. Nardelli there over the last few decades. And I can tell you this, if you work with any Chinese company, you're working with the Chinese government.</p><p>I mean they are so vertically integrated, I spent a day with Jack Ma at Alibaba last year and you can see that the data and all of the things that they're working on are all, you know, vertically integrated with the PLA as well as the government.</p><p>So I don't - I don't think any U.S. company can say that they're not working with the Chinese government unless they've done the study and review to make sure they're not doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well especially since Bob Nardelli, the Chinese military is the priority of the Chinese government. You know, I mentioned civil military fusion a minute ago, and that is because any innovation that comes into the Chinese government, first it is tested if it's going to work in the military because they're main goal is to be the number one superpower militarily.</p><p>PERDUE: Yes there's no question. I mean the senator said it right, any time we went over to China, you're always going to Beijing, you're always meeting with the government first if you want to, you know, invest in a business, if you want to create a business.</p><p>The senator knows that extremely well from his experience also. So it's totally transparent. I mean you're dealing with the government to deal with any business over there, whether we were making cars or whether we're selling locomotives or power systems, you're dealing with the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But once you understand that, Senator, you have to come up with another way to understand how the U.S. is going to work with China, right? I mean like this trade deal, the president commented that a deal with China is not any time soon, it's going to take a long time in terms of getting this done.</p><p>So how should we look at China given the fact that they want to beat us in everything, including becoming the number one superpower?</p><p>PERDUE: Well two things, Maria, and if you look at the made in China 2025, the Chinese mentality is such, it goes all the way back to Confucius and General Sun Tzu that they don't tell you what they're going to do unless they've decided that you don't have the wherewithal or the will to stop them.</p><p>And that's why I have to give President Trump all the credit in the world, the first president in the last five that has done anything to stand up and ask for a level playing field.</p><p>What President Trump is asking for is to stop stealing our technology, stop the forcing of technology comply with the WTO, give us equal access and stop the cyber war. I mean it's as simple as that. But it's going to take a while to negotiate on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was on with us earlier, here's what he said about that just a few minutes ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it fair to say it's probably a long time before we actually see deals here? What do you think, Secretary, where are we?</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: The fundamental question now though is will they go back to the point where we were before they change their mind and backtracked on some of the understandings that had been reached.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you have any optimism or encouragement that they are planning to stop the theft of I.P.? Isn't that one of the big ticket items? Real quick.</p><p>ROSS: Well the big ticket items are the structural reforms, the theft of I.P., the unlevel playing field and procurement, the subsidies, all those. But there's another in some ways even bigger issue and that is what is the U.S. enforcement capability in the event that they violate the agreements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the enforcement has been talked about. You've mentioned that as well, Senator. I got to get your take real quick before we leave this trade conversation because we want to get to the budget. Do you think USMCA is going to come to the floor?</p><p>PERDUE: Well I certainly hope so. It's certainly a dramatic improvement over NAFTA. Both sides, if it went to floor of the House we think it would pass right now, we knew it would pass the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but what if it doesn't? Do we have plan B sir?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, not right now. I mean it's up to Nancy Pelosi. I mean the Speaker needs to put this on the floor. The American people really want this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Capri.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, FBN ANCHOR: Senator, Capri Cafaro here.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>CAFARO: And I want to get your take on what's happening with the budget negotiations between Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. I understand that you are not in favor of a potential one-year continuing resolution, but it seems to me that we might be on a collision course here.</p><p>We have Democrats that look to be unwilling to either have a short-term deal or cut spending, and we have, you know, obviously the end of the fiscal year looming - September 30 - and we have - we're coming up against the potential of having to raise the debt ceiling. So what do you see happening here? And speaking of plan Bs, you know, do - is there a plan B if we can't get a deal on the budget and we try to avoid a CR?</p><p>PERDUE: Capri, thank you. That's the question of the day here. Look, I am very encouraged that Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi are dealing one-on-one. That was a breakthrough a week ago. They've made great progress. I'm hopeful that we're very close right now on the numbers.</p><p>Look, this is what's at stake here. If we go to a one-year CR, the military is devastated. We've done it 186 times over the last 45 years since the Budget Act was put into place in '74. It's a draconian impact. It causes expenses in military to go up dramatically.</p><p>So the small differences that we have right now in domestic spending and in military spending are small in comparison to the increases costs this will cause the military over the next decade.</p><p>Now, here's the other thing that's ridiculous about this. We're talking about $1.3 trillion on the discretionary party of the budget. We spend $4.6 trillion in the federal government. It's time that we start dealing with the mandatory expenses of social security, Medicare and Medicaid, pension benefits of federal employees, and the interest on the debt that's gone up dramatically over the last two years.</p><p>BELL: Senator, Lindsey Bell here. Just on that point, the budget deficit, we've had a deficit for a very long time going back to the 1960s. There's only been two times where we've had a surplus. It was the late 60s and then late 90's and early 2000s. Does the deficit even matter at this point?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, of course it matters at $22 trillion. There's $60 trillion of sovereign debt in the world. We're 5 percent of the world's population. We have one-third of the sovereign debt. You know, I think it's about 20 percent of the sovereign debt out there today is at negative interest rates, Lindsey, as you guys know, so this is a period of time with four balance sheets of central banks at the largest they've ever been,</p><p>It's a very concerning time right now. It's an uncharted terriority, but I can tell you this. The bond markets are not going to continue to support this sort of explosive growth in our debt. We've added $450 billion of interest expenses in the last two years in the nine Fed fund rate increases. And so, it's time that we deal with it, and we can deal with it. The resources are here to do it. We don't have to cut social security, but we can save social security who's trust fund goes to zero in 14 years and Medicare's trust fund goes to zero in 7 years.</p><p>Look, we can't hide from this any longer. That crisis is rushing at us like a freight train right now. Thanks for the question, Lindsay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you think you can save them. Your op-ed in The Defense Times say that the U.S. military is going to pay the price if no budget deal is reached at a time when you've got all these new threats across the world, right?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, that's exactly right. China doesn't have this problem, Russia doesn't have this problem, and right now China's spending - if you adjust for purchasing power parity, they're spending about the same amount as we are on their military.</p><p>And so, right now we can't afford to do this to the military. Last year was the first time in a decade, Maria, that we actually got the government's funding for the military without having news of continuing resolution. It causes expenses to go up dramatically. Recap, rationalization, and also readiness, it just destroys those efforts that we're trying to rebuild the military right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Senator, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much.</p><p>PERDUE: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator David Perdue joining us there in Washington. Coming up, going above and beyond, another restaurant giving the green light on the Beyond Meat burger. Where you can find the new meatless menu coming up. And then the world's wealthiest, Bill Gates knocked off his post as the world's second richest person in the world. We will tell you who snagged his spot coming up. Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:15:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has passed away. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheyrl -</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: That's right, Maria. A statement from the Supreme Court says that Stevens died of complications from a stroke. The Navy veteran was appointed by President Gerald Ford back in 1975. He served through 2010.</p><p>President Trump offered condolences saying, quote, \"his passion for the law and for our country will not soon be forgotten. He was known for his humbleness and his faith in the law.\" Justice Stevens was 99-years-old.</p><p>Well, investors are watching Bank of America this morning after the company reported record second quarter earnings. What a report. Net income from consumer banking climbed 13 percent. Consumer banking loans rose 6 percent. Adjusted revenue coming in at $23.23 billion. CEO Brian Moynihan said that they are seeing solid consumer activity across the board. There are the estimates and there are the actual numbers for Bank of America.</p><p>Well, LVMH's billionaire boss, Bernard Arnault is - Arnault - excuse me - is now the world's second richest person. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed a jumped in LVMH shares, and that pushed Arnault's net worth to $108 billion. Yes, with a B. That puts him ahead of Microsoft Co-Founder, Bill Gates, by more than $200 million. Arnault has added nearly $40 billion to his fortune this year alone. Not bad, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big numbers there, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Good lord, $108 billion. I can't even imagine where I'd be -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: - but it'd be somewhere sunny.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, the rise of the meatless menu - Beyond Meat burgers launching new restaurants nationwide today. We'll tell you where you can find them. That's coming up. And then Prime problems, why Amazon is seeing a spike in cancelled accounts following its annual shopping event next up right here.</p><p>[08:20:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: Prime problems -- the number of Amazon users canceling their prime accounts are spiking following the retail giant's annual shopping event. New data from search intelligence firm, CAPTIFY reveals people signed up for Amazon Prime to browse deals then immediately canceled their membership. Meanwhile CEO Jeff Bezos posted this picture of himself standing on Amazon's spheres after the two-day event thanking Prime members and Amazon workers. There he is. What a great two days it must have been as these sale days become more prevalent. Bob, your take on Amazon right now.</p><p>NARDELLI: It is like having a Black Friday in the middle of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: And I'm not surprised. I mean when I was at Home Depot, we'd sell a ton of TVs before the Super Bowl. It's amazing how many of them didn't work after Super Bowl.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How funny.</p><p>NARDELLI: They would come back. So people would take advantage of it. It doesn't involve anything to sign up, they get the deals and then why continue. You know it's a small fee but why continue?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well and all these other retailers are having to compete too.</p><p>NARDELLI: They are.</p><p>BELL: You know Walmart, Target, everyone jumping in on this deal, and it's kind of interesting because it is moving some of the sales more to the middle of the year instead of being that fourth quarter as you know, heavy weighted towards revenue.</p><p>CAFARO: Do we know much Amazon Prime profits actually make up for the totality of how much Amazon makes when you think about the general, sort of, retail cycle where people make so much of their money around the holidays for example. Is this shifting that?</p><p>CAFARO: Yes.</p><p>NARDELLI: It's a lot. I mean even if you look at Costco they make it more on membership is what provides the profitability for Costco than actually the retail sales. It's an interesting model.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about the rise of the meatless menu Beyond Meat burgers launching nearly 4,000 Tim Horton's restaurants across country this morning. It comes as Blue Apron stock soared yesterday after announcing a partnership with Beyond Meat. Obviously Blue Apron has gotten killed recently but it was up 35 percent on this deal. The whole meal subscription company up on -- on doing a deal with Tim Horton. As you can see, the stock had a great day.</p><p>BELL: Well yes, the Blue Apron thing is pretty interesting. I mean they've had to do a lot to kind of really make themselves relevant and build their customer base back up so they're doing all these different deals. I think Weight Watchers, they have a deal with too so they had to do stocks but their stock was under.</p><p>CAFARO: Well they were one of the first in the marketplace when it came to these, you know, meal kit subscription boxes. Blue Apron was one of the first.</p><p>[08:25:00]</p><p>They're out there and now there is so much more competition with Plated and even things like Purple Carrot which is specific for vegan and vegetarian so I don't - I don't think it surprising that Blue Apron as well as some of these other fast-food chains that are having to compete with many fast casual restaurants that you know can deliver more healthy product that I think is more friendly to today's consumer trends so I think .</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes, I'm not a big user of it. I don't .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you eat - that's what I was going to say.</p><p>CAFARO: Me neither.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But does it taste good? I like the veggie burgers but I think some of these burgers, it's - it's less vegetable and some chemical. So that's the only thing I'm - I'm ..</p><p>BELL: Right and the calorie count is still the same. I mean I like meat so I'm going to just go ahead and have a beef burger.</p><p>NARDELLI: A beef burger.</p><p>CAFARO: If you're going to go for it, go for it.</p><p>NARDELLI: Five Guys and a burger right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to talk real estate when we come back. We are awaiting the June housing starts and building permits data that's going to come out momentarily. We'll have the numbers after the break and then we'll get into real estate. Then Ion Earnings streaming Netflix and tech giant IBM set to report after the bell tonight everything you need to know coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17. Your top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East coast. Breaking news on housing. We are awaiting housing starts and building permits for the month of June. We'll have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape and we're taking a look at the housing market and where it is headed now. As we await the numbers take a look at futures that are pretty much at the high of the morning with the Dow futures up 16 points, the NASDAQ up 11.25 and the S&amp;P 500 futures up 2 points right now. After yesterday's record run took a pause, yesterday markets were lower across the board with the Dow down 23, the S&amp;P down 10 and the NASDAQ lower by 35.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the European indices right now are lower across the board. As you see the FQ 100 down 14, the CAC down 9 and the DAX index lower by 20 points.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>In Asia overnight, trade fears drove markets there as well lower. As you can see, fractional losses, but pretty much across the board. President Trump says there is still a long way to go for a deal with China. Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, telling me this morning that structural reform's needed - are needed and U.S. enforcement capabilities important to have any deal across the finish line.</p><p>Building permits are out and they are $1.22 million. That is below the $1.300 million we were expecting. Once the starts are also a little lower than the estimates. Let's get right to Lauren Simonetti. She's got the breaking news right now on housing starts and building permits. Lauren -</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN HOST: Both numbers weaker than expected, Maria. Housing starts coming in at $1.253 million for the month of June. The expectation was for $1.261 million, so that's a decline of 0.9 percent month-over-month.</p><p>You gave the permits number. I will put some perspective behind it. The expectation was 1.3 million. 1.22 million units was the number, so both of these for June weaker than expected. Is the housing market going to continue to be a drag on economic growth? We're looking at a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 3.75 percent. That National Association of Home Builders relatively confident, and the thinking is as mortgage rates continue to move lower maybe this will boost some of the optimism we can be seeing in the housing market, but right now this report worse than expected.</p><p>I'm also seeing that the May numbers were revised it looks like a little bit to the - a little bit higher, but I will continue to look into that for you. Maria -</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. All right, we'll get back to you -</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - as you see any new information in those numbers (ph), Lauren. Thank you so much. No real impact on markets this morning, but joining me right now to talk more about housing and real estate in general is Equity Group Investments Founder, Chairman, and real estate billionaire investor, Sam Zell. Sam, great to see you.</p><p>SAM ZELL, EQUITY GROUP INVESTMENTS FOUDNER AND CHAIRMAN: Good morning, Maria. How are you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. What was your reaction? I know this is just a month and it's residential, but your take on what we're seeing in the housing market today?</p><p>ZELL: Well, I think that, you know, the housing market today reflects the fact that people are reticent to commit. People are reticent to take long- term responsibilities. They're also, you know, particularly in the starter home side affected by student debts and other debts that make their ability to effect purchase and put down a down payment more of a challenge.</p><p>Having said that, $1.22 million - I mean, you know, $1.22 million versus $1.3 million is hardly anything worth jumping up and down about it, and I know you guys are in the business of -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: - in effect making news -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tick-by-tick, but yes, you're right.</p><p>ZELL: - yes, but the reality is overall it's not either a disaster or a success.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to say about the office market right now? In terms of commercial real estate, how would you characterize it?</p><p>ZELL: I think the office market today is in a very unique place. The creation of all of these, for lack of a better word, temporary office facilities I think has weakened - dramatically weakened the credit of the office-building business.</p><p>You know, the reason people invested in office buildings was because it gave them long-term credit exposure and effectively were leasing and creating enormous percentage of office space to non-credit tenants that sooner or later is going to be a very difficult scenario to deal with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how do - how do rates fit in to all of this? I mean, mortgage REITs raised $6.2 billion in equity to increase their investment portfolios last year according to The Journal, and you've got - I know mortgage rates having come off the lows.</p><p>ZELL: Well, but the fact that they raised whatever it is, $6 trillion in mortgages, frankly, you know, all that means is that they're easily providing refinancing capability for the industry. So I don't think we're looking at a shortage of capital, but I also don't see any significant positive, and I see a lot of supply coming on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of supply coming on. Well, that's -</p><p>ZELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - something to focus on. What's your take, broadly speaking, of the backdrop in terms of the economy right now?</p><p>[08:35:00]</p><p>We're having this conversation every day about the Federal Reserve.</p><p>ZELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now we're preparing for a rate cut in two weeks - July 31. It could be as high as 50 basis points according to Rick Rieder from BlackRock who was with me last week. Characterize the backdrop for us.</p><p>ZELL: Well, I think that, you know, we're looking at an environment that is very puzzling for everybody. I'm very involved in real estate, but I'm also involved in a lot of other areas, and I've been studying them, looking for signs that the game's changing, the game's over, et cetera, et cetera and not seeing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You can't find them.</p><p>ZELL: And when we had a couple of, you know, bad employment reports and then we had a good one. You know, we had one of our companies, you know, six months ago alerted me that, gee, what looks like future bookings are going to be down. And I said, \"aha, we finally - you know, finally got the sign.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ZELL: And then I had lunch with the CEO last weekend. He said, \"oh, everything is terrific. That was just a blip and we don't -\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>ZELL: So you know, everybody would like to know what the answer is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: I'm the first one to tell you I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what happens when the Fed cuts rates in two weeks?</p><p>ZELL: Nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does it - does it stimulate the market in any way? Does it stimulate the housing market?</p><p>ZELL: No. I think that the biggest thing that cutting rates will do - I mean, look. Rates are preposterously low.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. What happens when more room - do they have to do anything frankly?</p><p>ZELL: So - well, but what is - what is lowering rates below the inflation rate do? Not a lot of good stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: And generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of very low rates. I think very low rates discourage decision making. And our economy is predicated on a sense of urgency. We achieve things because we have a sense of urgency. When a cost of capital is as low as it's been, that sense of urgency disappears and the overall economy, it doesn't jump. It frankly weakens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a good point that sense of urgency moves people to action, right?</p><p>ZELL: Yes, well you've got to make a decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry, right.</p><p>ZELL: If you don't - if you can afford not to make a decision, you got another option.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. You can stay with cash (ph).</p><p>ZELL: Now, when the cost of capital is 10, you look at your watch every minute and say, \"I better make a decision.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: When the cost of capital is 2, \"I'll wait till tomorrow.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: I have time.</p><p>ZELL: Time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: And that, you know, ripples out throughout the whole economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've been allocating capital in interesting ways away from real estate in waste industry, certainly international, so how do you want to allocate capital? What can you tell our viewers about what you see in, for example, the emerging markets or in Europe right now?</p><p>ZELL: Well, I have not been an investor in Europe for a long time. I'm still not an investor in Europe. You know, when you are an investor, you're basically gauging future demand. You know, will there be demand for what I'm investing in and maybe superior demand allowing price to go up?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, zero percent a hard time growing (ph). No growing.</p><p>ZELL: To say the - well, great cheese, great wine, great castles.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, right.</p><p>ZELL: You know, I mean, I go there on vacation. It's wonderful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're not going to be putting money there?</p><p>ZELL: But I can't find anybody there who wants to work. So yes, we've stayed out of Europe. I mean, look at where they're - I think there's 30 some odd countries in the E.U. 17 of them have negative demographic growth. Well, if the number of people - BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>ZELL: - at the end of the year is less in more than half of the E.U., where is the demand going to come from?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really good way of putting it actually.</p><p>ZELL: I mean, I don't know how to explain it in any other way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do -</p><p>ZELL: Outside of Europe, you know, the siren of the emerging markets is always there because it may not be profitable, but there's growth, and every optimist believes that if there's growth you can figure a way to profitability. I'd say my own experience has been that we've been very successful and very unsuccessful using the same standards for investment, so it's a challenge, but the fact that there's growth means that at least if you get the methodology right you've got the engine to make that valuable.</p><p>[08:40:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: You - let me take you back to the U.S. because -</p><p>ZELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - you've invested in the waste industry.</p><p>ZELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me where the growth is there.</p><p>ZELL: Well, I mean, let's put it a different way. You know, the answer is that there may be lowering of demand in a lot of other areas, but I think trash is probably at the bottom of the list. I think that, you know, we're very - we're the largest provider of waste energy facilities I think in the world -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>ZELL: - where we're - basically our raw material is trash. And the amount of trash decreasing and landfills are being eliminated, so I'm just a supply-demand situation. It's an arena worth playing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, in the face of all of this while you're looking for growth and investing alongside that and you've got an economy that feels good, there's this infighting going on in Washington, and it looks like -</p><p>ZELL: You noticed?</p><p>BARITORMO: Yes. It looks like 2020 in this upcoming election is being set up as capitalism versus socialism, President Trump versus these progressive Democrats. The House voted to pass a resolution condemning President Trump's recent tweets singling out four congresswomen that measured on largely along party lines with only four Republicans joining democratic colleagues.</p><p>The singled-out Democrats, of course, they're referred to as The Squad. They weighed in on a feud with President Trump and their relationship with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Watch this. They were on a competitive network. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), M.I.: I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with in my lifetime and trying to push back on that and trying to do the job that we all have been sent here to do which is centered around the people at home. This is a distraction.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), N.Y.: Our teams are in communication. Our chiefs are -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But shouldn't it be a face-to-face? I want to know if you are speaking -</p><p>TLAIB: She's the new member, not the Speaker.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, but -</p><p>TLAIB: She has every right to sit down with her in any moment, any time with any of us. She is Speaker of the House. She can ask for a meeting to sit down with us for clarification.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARITROMO: Well, she wants - Nancy Pelosi wants clarification. Instead, these four women are just tweeting it or talking about it and bringing all of the dirty laundry out into the public.</p><p>ZELL: Well, one of them was just talking about the fact that she's never been bullied as much in her whole life -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't know - I didn't understand -</p><p>ZELL: - and all I know is that these four women represent bullying. So and we've got a situation that's relatively out of control. We have a president who I think would do better if he was a little more restrained. I think we have congressman who are not showing the respect to the office of the presidency. Forget about the fact they may or may not agree with this specific presidency.</p><p>This same group of people 10 years ago had there been the same accusations about Bill Clinton as an example, where were they?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: There wasn't anybody, you know, taking the other side then. So I think we have a dysfunctional situation. There is no - there is not right answer. There is no wrong answer. Everybody needs to stop focusing on being victims and stop - and start focusing on how do we make America work better for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As a businessman looking for the right policies to move things forward and actually see growth, the policies so far have worked in terms of the economic policies.</p><p>ZELL: I think the economic policies have been - have produced very positive results so far -</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet -</p><p>ZELL: - despite all the noise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - The Squad won't admit that. I mean, The Squad wants Medicare for all. They all, you know, the Green New Deal, et cetera.</p><p>ZELL: They've proposed a whole bunch of ideas, and none of those ideas have come with a balance sheet explaining how they're going to finance it. So until somebody comes up with ideas that are financeable and potentially viable, it's hard to, other than if you're reporter, waste a lot of time on those subjects.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you decided as a business person who you're going to get behind in the 2020 election?</p><p>ZELL: No. I don't - it - this particular stage that is not high on my list -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZELL: - of things I need to worry about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see. This is - the socialist conversation is pretty scary frankly.</p><p>ZELL: Yes, I mean, I - you know, what was it, Margaret Thatcher who said that, you know, when I asked when socialism will end her answer was when you run out of other people with money to spend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Sam, thank you.</p><p>ZELL: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sam Zell will be my special guest this weekend on Wall Street. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>[08:45:00]</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're going to show you the tweet that President Trump just put out. He just wrote this. \"Big rally tonight in Greenville, North Carolina. Lots of great things to tell you about including the fact that our economy is the best it has every been. Best employment and stock market numbers ever. I'll talk also about people who love and hate our country - mostly love.\" Tonight at 7 p.m. the president has another rally in Greenville, North Carolina.</p><p>Meanwhile this, a new survey is shedding light on the financial woes of millennials. Joining me now, the host of Varney &amp; Company, Stuart Varney, to weigh in on that. Good morning Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST: Maria, I'm not going to go on a rant about the younger generation.</p><p>(LAUGTHER)</p><p>I will never say, \"get off my lawn.\" I simply report this to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>VARNEY: TD Ameritrade says that one in five millennials, 20 percent of millennials, expect to be financially reliant on their parents into their 30s, OK. How about that? No, I'm not going to say these youngsters today. I'm not going to say that because, I mean, I can understand you got student loans around your neck and it's very hard to get a mortgage these days, so I do understand.</p><p>My point here is now we can understand why free stuff is so attractive to the millennial generation. After all, if you're getting free stuff from your parents way into your 30s, why don't you get free college and free medical care from Uncle Bernie? You can understand why it's attractive.</p><p>I think that this attitude towards money on the part of the parents has influenced millennials politics. One last one, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Most of the parents in the survey found it embarrassing if their children stay on the parental payroll past the age of 27, so it's our fault. That's what I'm saying.</p><p>[08:50:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: All this free stuff, Stu. Is there any conversation about who will pay for it?</p><p>VARNEY: No, of course not. Good lord. Do you ask your parents where they got the money from when they donate to you? No, you don't ask about that, so they're not.</p><p>BARITROMO: There you go. Stuart, now you'll have a lot more about that in 10 minutes. We will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: Sure will. You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Varney &amp; Company begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern right after Mornings With Maria joins Stuart next. But first, we are watching earnings, streaming giant Netflix and tech giant IBM will report after the bell tonight. We're going to take you live to the trading floor for a preview of the numbers and tell you what to look at for when those numbers are released, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Netflix is the story we're talking about tomorrow. It's reporting earnings after the bell tonight. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with some details. Gerri, good morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning to you Maria. That's right, Netflix shares trading higher here, expectations for earning .56 cents a share revenues, expected to come in at 4.93 billion. That will be after the bell tonight. The big worry here what everybody's watching of course are subscribers. The company has all ready said that they will have five million new subscribers, that is a slow down. And the big worry of course here is that the company is losing ground against an increasing long list of competitors, including Disney, Hulu, Amazon Prime, you name it. Apple, Warner, NBC Universal lots of people coming into that category. Meanwhile, IBM will also be out after the bell, expecting to come at $3.07 a share, $19.16 billion in revenue, that's the expectation. Shares are higher here, they have had several quarters of declining revenue. Watch for that revenue line, that is a critical thing. The company's betting on that red hate acquisition to fuel results. They all ready have a multi-billion dollar deal with AT&amp;T after the red hat acquisition. We'll be watching how well they do in the hybrid crowd - cloud that is, Maria back to you.</p><p>[08:55:00]</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right Gerri, thanks so much. We'll be watching as well.

You must be very proud.</p><p>NARDELLI: You know, it's - I'm very proud of both the boys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The series is called \"Dark Web\". Have you seen it?</p><p>NARDELLI: I have, it's an eight part episode, so if you want to binge, you can do that starting Friday night. But it's a wonderful series. Obviously I'm very, very, very proud of both sons.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't that great? We could look at the streaming wars from your side which is - your sons' side and that is as content creators.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we'll be watching. \"Dark Web\", check it out.

Stephane Kasriel, another former PayPal exec, will be head ofFacebook Pay, a P2P service designed to rival PayPal's Venmo. Facebook Pay is expected to roll out in the U.S. on Instagram, and is being tested in Brazil.</p><p>None of these initiatives are new, but they were built and marketed separately. And as Google, Amazon and Apple expand their financial services and payment projects, the pressure is on Facebook to demonstrate diverse commerce options. These firms have huge user bases, which they rely on to optimize add and transaction revenue.</p><p>There's an immense desire for any social media company to keep users in the ecosystem, said Thad Peterson, senior analyst at Aite. \"There is no value to Facebook if a user leaves their ecosystem to make a purchase, except for a possible piece of the transaction,\" Peterson said.</p><p>SinceFacebook Credits, the social network's earlier attempt to build its own currency, failed earlier in the 2010s, Facebook has made considerable progress in adding transactional capabilities.</p><p>This lack of financial services acumen was considered part of Credits' failure, and Facebook spent the rest of the decadeadding tools and expertsto support services that its now-1.7 billion userscan access from login.</p><p>\"By providing a payments function within their ecosystem, they increase user convenience and eliminate a reason for a user to leave,\" Peterson said. \"Increased stickiness along with the decreased friction of embedded payments keeps a user in the space and that's a good thing for Facebook.\"</p><p>Marcushas been a main driver of this evolution, joining Facebook in 2014 after leaving the top role at PayPal. Facebook put Marcus in charge of Messenger, helping to build Messenger's profile as a payment enabler through invoicing partnerships withPayPaland bringingpayment functionsin closer proximity to advertising.</p><p>Marcus has since led Facebook's blockchain work, co-founded the Libra cryptocurrency project and headed Facebook's Novi digital wallet, and is now the supervisor of Facebook Financial. Other payments talent followed Marcus, such as former PayPal execDeborah Liu, a vice president at Facebook's Marketplace who has helped add AI technology to make it easier to connect buyers and sellers. More recently, Facebook hired another former PayPal exec, Kasriel, to serve as a payment vice president reporting to Marcus.</p><p>Facebook recently acquiredPackagd, a small video shopping startup, to build a live shopping feature in Marketplace. It has made several improvements toInstagramover the past year, improving buy and donate buttons in an effort to keep people on the site longer.Facebook Pay, which launched late in 2019, serves as a transfer app and a way to consolidate transactions for Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, strengthening the ties between Facebook's services.</p><p>Facebook would not comment for this story. By bringing together several consumer-facing products, Facebook can pair familiar e-commerce and Venmo-style social P2P with features that are newer and prone to regulatory and political pressure in numerous countries due to concerns over their impact on central bank monetary control or competitive balance. That potentially generates more consumer interest burgeoning payment features fromWhatsApp, Facebook's investment in a new e-commerce venture fromReliance Jioand the pendingLibracryptocurrency.</p><p>The integration is additionally a way to keep pace with other large technology companies that are expanding commerce options. Apple in the past year has added a credit card in partnership withGoldman Sachs, enabling Apple to string Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, the App Store, streaming content and credit through a single relationship. Apple more recently agreed to acquireMobeewave, giving Apple a route to support point of sale transactions in addition to its existing stack.</p><p>Googlehas added a group of banks to support checking accounts, linking Google Pay to traditional banking services and value-added services for both the banks and the technology giant.

An internal company memo sent by a senior executive to employees addressed Facebook's shortcomings and was published by the New York Times on Tuesday.<br/>Ranking Republican member Cathy McMorris Rodgers said consumers are losing faith in sources they can trust online but focus should be on innovation to combat falsified videos and not more regulation.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Earlier this week, Facebook said it would remove deepfakes - which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic but fake videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not - as well as other manipulated or misleadingly edited videos from its platform in a move to curb misinformation. It will not remove content deemed to be parody or satire.<br/>Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of global policy management, said the social media platform recognises the risks of manipulated media and that \"its latest policy is designed to prohibit the most sophisticated attempts to mislead people.\"<br/>Bickert faced criticism from lawmakers for the company's decision to not remove a heavily edited video that attempted to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seem incoherent by slurring her speech.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"Why wouldn't Facebook simply take down the fake Pelosi video?\" Florida Congressman Darren Soto, a Democrat, said.<br/>Bickert said such videos will be labeled false and are subject to fact-checking. \"Our enforcement is not perfect,\" but it has gotten better, she said.<br/>The company took down one network that spread false information in 2016. It has removed 50 such networks in 2019, she said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Facebook has been criticised over its content policies by politicians across the spectrum. Democrats have blasted the company for refusing to fact-check political advertisements, while Republicans have accused it of discriminating against conservative views, a charge it has denied.<br/>California Congressman Jerry McKerney asked if Facebook would be ready for an independent third-party audit of its practices by 1 June, results of which would be visible to the public.<br/>Bickert did not answer the question.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-493187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-CHW1-JBYT-H44V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The social network said the fine could be as high as $5 billion, dwarfing the agency's previous record privacy civil penalty of a  $22.5 million. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors appeared to accept the fine as a one-time cost of doing business as the company reported otherwise better-than-expected financial results. Both its quarterly revenue and total number of global users increased year-over-year -- even in the face of mounting scrutiny from policymakers around the world. </p><p>\"The stock is up largely because the intrinsic performance of the business was better than anticipated,\" said Youssef Squali, head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group at SunTrust. </p><p>By pre-empting the FTC and announcing an estimate of the fine, Facebook could be trying to put more than a year of privacy scandals behind it, Squali said. </p><p>Facebook is facing a fine as it negotiates a settlement with the FTC that would conclude its yearlong investigation into whether the company violated a previous privacy agreement with the agency. The FTC opened the probe following the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, and in that time, the company has had repeated privacy transgressions -- ranging from data breaches to failing to securely store users' passwords. At this time, the exact contours of the FTC probe remain unclear. </p><p>But Big Tech's critics saw the Wall Street rally as an indication that even a record-setting fine would do little to draw blood from the social networking giant. The company's projection reignited concerns the Washington agency is not equipped to police one of the world's most valuable companies -- and prompted policymakers and advocates to call for antitrust action or other penalties beyond fines. </p><p>As many observers noted, even at the high end of the range Facebook estimated, the fine would only be a fraction of the nearly $56 billion in annual revenue Facebook reported in 2018. </p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rekindled her calls to break up the company. </p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, who heads the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said Congress may need to step in if the FTC's action amounts to a \"slap on the wrist.\" The Rhode Island Democrat previously called for the agency to investigate Facebook for antitrust violations. </p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the predicted fine would be \"paltry\" in comparison to Facebook's profits last quarter, and he called for broad changes within the business. </p><p>Tim Wu, the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Guilded Age,\" said the fine should just be the beginning. He suggested the company should be required to sell off one of its major subsidiaries, WhatsApp. </p><p>To be sure, it was an unusual step for Facebook to preempt the FTC and announce the fine while negotiations with the agency are still ongoing. Facebook acknowledged the matter is \"unresolved and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\" </p><p>It's also very possible that any settlement will come with the kinds of structural remedies that Blumenthal is calling for. Tony Romm of The Washington Post reported last week that the federal regulators could seek new, heightened oversight of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. One idea that has been floated could require him or other executives to certify the company's privacy practices periodically to the board of directors. </p><p>Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the FTC, told the New York Times yesterday that any regulatory mandates -- curbing the company's ability to share information with business partners or require it to disclose more information to consumers about how it collects data -- could pack a bigger punch than fines. </p><p>\"Those will have the most lasting impact on consumers' privacy,\" Soltani said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-1074248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-2X51-DYCW-C2K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The social network said the fine could be as high as $5 billion, dwarfing the agency's previous record privacy civil penalty of a $22.5 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors appeared to accept the fine as a one-time cost of doing business as the company reported otherwise better-than-expected financial results. Both its quarterly revenue and total number of global users increased year-over-year - even in the face of mounting scrutiny from policymakers around the world.</p><p> \"The stock is up largely because the intrinsic performance of the business was better than anticipated,\" said Youssef Squali, head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group at SunTrust.</p><p> By preempting the FTC and announcing an estimate of the fine, Facebook could be trying to put more than a year of privacy scandals behind it, Squali said.</p><p>Facebook is facing a fine as it negotiates a settlement with the FTC that would conclude its year-long investigation into whether the company violated a previous privacy agreement with the agency. The FTC opened the probe following the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, and in that time, the company has had repeated privacy transgressions, - ranging from data breaches to failing to securely store users' passwords. At this time, the exact contours of the FTC probe remain unclear.</p><p> But Big Tech's critics saw the Wall Street rally as an indication that even a record-setting fine would do little to draw blood from the social networking giant. The company's projection reignited concerns the Washington agency is not equipped to police one of the world's most valuable companies - and prompted policymakers and advocates to call for antitrust action or other penalties beyond fines.</p><p> As many observers noted, even at the high end of the range Facebook estimated, the fine would only be a fraction of the nearly $56 billion in annual revenue Facebook reported in 2018.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rekindled her calls to break up the company.</p><p> Rep. David Cicilline, who heads the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said Congress may need to step in if the FTC's action amounts to a \"slap on the wrist.\" The Rhode Island Democrat previously called for the agency to investigate Facebook for antitrust violations.</p><p> Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the predicted fine would be \"paltry\" in comparison to Facebook's profits last quarter, and he called for broad changes within the business:</p><p> Tim Wu, the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Guilded Age,\" said the fine should just be the beginning. He suggested the company should be required to sell off one of its major subsidiaries, WhatsApp.</p><p> To be sure, it was an unusual step for Facebook to preempt the FTC and announce the fine while negotiations with the agency are still ongoing. Facebook itself acknowledge the matter is \"unresolved and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\"</p><p> It's also very possible that any settlement will come with the kinds of structural remedies that Blumenthal is calling for. My colleague Tony Romm reported last week that the federal regulators could seek new, heightened oversight of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. One idea that has been floated could require him or other executives to certify the company's privacy practices periodically to the board of directors.</p><p> Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the FTC, told the New York Times yesterday that any regulatory mandates - curbing the company's ability to share information with business partners or require it to disclose more information to consumers about how it collects data - could pack a bigger punch than fines.</p><p> \"Those will have the most lasting impact on consumers' privacy,\" Soltani said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINSAL-WSJ0028781217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABD6D47D9085 WINSAL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W00-9WX1-DXVP-V234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Winston-Salem Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Winston-Salem Journal (North Carolina)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The mere threat of tighter regulation, updated antitrust legislation and revenue taxes could send valuations tumbling. That process might already be under way.</p><p>On Monday, Facebookshares took their worst fall in more than five years as the company's alleged role in the Cambridge Analytics data harvesting scandal triggered a global backlash.</p><p>The shares dropped almost 7 per cent, wiping US$35-billlion off its valuation. On Tuesday, as more revelations about Facebook's evidently lax approach to data protection filled the headlines, the shares took another tumble - they were down about 2.5 per cent in Tuesday trading. Facebookfounder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has had better days; traders are joking that his chances of running for president in 2020 have dropped to zero.</p><p>The Great Tech Rollover may be under way and could prove infectious. Facebookinvestors are obviously worried that regulators will clamp down on the company. Already, investigations into the alleged misuse of Facebookuser data has triggered a flurry of investigations. Among the curious, and possibly furious, are Britain's data protection authority, the Massachusetts attorney-general and the U.S Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>In reality, the tech sector has seen better days, even if is premature to say that the touted \"tech bubble\" is set to burst - bubbles are never proven bubbles until they do. Shares of Snap (formerly Snapchat) are down 18 per cent in the last year, taking them below their US$17 initial public offering price. Dropbox, an online file-storage company, is heading to the stock market with a valuation almost 30 per cent below its peak. Softbank made an investment in Uber in late 2017 that valued the ride-hailing company at about US$48-billon, well short of the US$68-billion valuation implied in the previous private funding round. Its valuation won't be helped by the accident in Arizona on Sunday, when an Uber self-driving car killed a pedestrian. Uber's growth plan rests in good part on self-driving technology.</p><p>And then there is Bitcoin, perhaps the ultimate tech play. According to coinmarketcap.com, the cryptocurrency is worth about US$8,500. In December, it had hit US$20,000. The other top cryptocurrencies - Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin - are getting their lights punched out too.</p><p>The so called FAANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (owned by Alphabet) - might be next, as the tech selling pressure moves to the biggies.</p><p>To be sure, selloff panic has not set in yet, even if Facebookis taking a beating. Credit goes to Donald Trump. He's lowering corporate taxes. Crucially for investors, the new tax law will allow American companies to repatriate cash sitting in foreign bank accounts at a vastly reduced rate, possibly as low as 8 per cent compared with the normal 35-per-cent repatriation hit.</p><p>Apple alone has more than US$250-billion parked overseas; collectively, American companies have some US$2.6-trillion in offshore accounts. When this loot comes roaring back, as it will, a lot of it will be used to fund tech share buybacks, propping up share prices. That's what happened in the last big repatriation.</p><p>Still, the potential forces working in the opposite direction cannot be discounted and are potentially fearsome.</p><p>For years, consumer groups and privacy advocates have been putting pressure on legislators to hit Facebookwith tough regulations. The calls intensified when Russia allegedly used Facebookto influence American voters in the 2016 election. On Sunday, when news broke that Cambridge Analytica was given access to vast amounts of Facebookdata and may not have deleted it, Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar declared on Twitter that \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"</p><p>At the same time, the tech biggies are getting so big that antitrust laws might have to be changed to rein them in. Google has almost 90 per cent of the market for search advertising; Facebook(including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) controls more than 70 per cent of media traffic on mobile devices; Amazon has 70 per cent of the e-book market. The concentration of corporate power in the tech world is becoming formidable and scary. Who is going to launch a competitor to Facebookor Google? No one, is the answer. Consumer welfare demands a fresh look at antitrust laws.</p><p>Another threat to Big Tech is taxation. The European Union is planning to slap a revenue tax on top digital companies such as Twitter and Alphabet, some of which are expert at exploiting tax loopholes in various EU countries. A draft proposal would see the tax set at 3 per cent of gross revenues. While that's not a lot, it might be enough to spook investors. It could also lead to other taxes. How about a tax on personal data transfers?</p><p>The Facebookpounding is adding to jitters across the tech sector. This could get ugly for investors.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/facebooks-stock-slide-could-portend-big-problems-for-big-tech/article38310402/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/facebooks-stock-slide-could-portend-big-problems-for-big-tech/article38310402/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180320escenic_38310402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX9-NJS1-F072-J0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><timeReceived>1:38 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Uber's growth plan rests in good part on self-driving technology.</p><p>And then there is bitcoin, perhaps the ultimate tech play.</p><p>According to coinmarketcap.com, the cryptocurrency is worth about US$9,000. In December, it had hit US$20,000. The other top cryptocurrencies - ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin - are getting their lights punched out, too.</p><p>The so called FAANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google (owned by Alphabet) - might be next, as the tech selling pressure moves to the biggies.</p><p>To be sure, sell-off panic has not set in yet, even if Facebook is taking a beating. Credit goes to Donald Trump. He's lowering corporate taxes. Crucially for investors, the new tax law will allow American companies to repatriate cash sitting in foreign bank accounts at a vastly reduced rate, possibly as low as 8 per cent compared with the normal 35-percent repatriation hit.</p><p>Apple alone has more than US$250-billion parked overseas; collectively, American companies have some US$2.6-trillion in offshore accounts. When this loot comes roaring back, as it will, a lot of it will be used to fund tech share buybacks, propping up share prices. That's what happened in the previous big repatriation.</p><p>Still, the potential forces working in the opposite direction cannot be discounted and are potentially fearsome. For years, consumer groups and privacy advocates have been putting pressure on legislators to hit Facebook with tough regulations. The calls intensified when Russia allegedly used Facebook to influence American voters in the 2016 election. On Sunday, when news broke that Cambridge Analytica was given access to vast amounts of Facebook data and may not have deleted them, Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar declared on Twitter that \"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves.\"</p><p>At the same time, the tech biggies are getting so big that antitrust laws might have to be changed to rein them in. Google has almost 90 per cent of the market for search advertising; Facebook (including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) controls more than 70 per cent of media traffic on mobile devices; Amazon has 70 per cent of the e-book market. The concentration of corporate power in the tech world is becoming formidable and scary.</p><p>Who is going to launch a competitor to Facebook or Google? No one, is the answer. Consumer welfare demands a fresh look at antitrust laws.</p><p>Another threat to Big Tech is taxation. The European Union is planning to slap a revenue tax on top digital companies such as Twitter and Alphabet, some of which are experts at exploiting tax loopholes in various EU countries. A draft proposal would see the tax set at 3 per cent of gross revenues. While that's not a lot, it might be enough to spook investors. It could also lead to other taxes. How about a tax on personal data transfers?</p><p>The Facebook pounding is adding to jitters across the tech sector.</p><p>This could get ugly for investors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180321rbcoregulyfacebook</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXF-H4B1-F06S-319P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But can you trust them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new \"Study\" app by the tech giant will look at which apps users are interested in, where they're used and how long you spend on them. Facebook says they won't collect user IDs, passwords or messages and the information won't be sold to a third party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, former three-term Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian, in an interview with the Star, says Facebook faces trust issues with the public, and a third party auditor should be used to make sure the company is in compliance.</p><p>\"Given their past history, it doesn't give me a lot of confidence in what they're saying,\" says Cavoukian, executive director of Toronto-based Global Privacy and Security by Design. \"The last time they said they were protecting your information they ended up selling it to a third party.\"</p><p>Federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is suing Facebook over allegedly breaching Canadian privacy laws. A report by the federal and B.C. commissioners found that in a year-long investigation into the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, 87 million users had unknowingly had their personal information harvested.</p><p>The investigation found that not only had Facebook broken Canadian privacy laws, but that it had consistently refused to accept recommendations to rectify the problem.</p><p>Facebook says the new Study app is for \"business and product research\" and that the information will be used to \"learn which apps people value and how they're used.\" The data will likely be used in different ways, including possibly targeting where the audience is for Facebook advertising. Earlier incarnations of Facebook study apps had participants sending in screenshots of Amazon purchases. The company has also used research apps in the past to track potential acquisition targets.</p><p>Facebook and Google take up more than 70 per cent of the digital advertising market using sophisticated analytics to track their audience. A study released this week by the News Media Alliance, which represents U.S.-based newspapers, estimates that Google made $4.7 billion (U.S.) in 2018 alone, almost as much as the entire American news industry.</p><p>However, the online platforms have come under greater scrutiny by legislators over privacy issues for their methods, even as legacy publishers struggle to compete in the marketplace.</p><p>Problematically, the new app released by Facebook comes after it was discovered in January that the platform was running a similar program called Facebook Research that ended up being pulled by Apple.</p><p>The app was similar to another Facebook-owned app called Onavo, where the company used data to gather information about users. That app was pulled in 2018 because Apple said it violated privacy laws after an investigation by online digital magazine TechCrunch. The Study app is available in the Google Play Store, but not the Apple App Store.</p><p>\"Their previous use of data was not fair, not transparent or accountable,\" Cavoukian says of Facebook.</p><p>But the newly released Study app is also problematic. Some experts worry users may not know exactly what they are signing up for.</p><p>\"Facebook is asking for permission to see app activities from other apps that a user may have installed on their phone, and not just the Facebook app,\" says Philip Mai, Director Business and Communications of the Ryerson Social Media Lab at the Ted Rogers School of Management. \"Access to this kind of information can contain important signals about things that a user might want to remain private or keep secret.\"</p><p>However, Mai acknowledges the new app is at least more transparent than what the company had previously offered.</p><p>\"I am glad to see they are offering more transparency, compensating all participants and promising not to reshare the data,\" says Mai.</p><p>\"Privacy is about personal control of your information and there's nothing wrong with getting value for it,\" says Cavoukian. \"Despite my thoughts on compliance, Facebook is at least agreeing to compensate you in this case instead of simply harvesting it and selling it.\"</p><p>Facebook did not outline what the exact remuneration would be for participating.</p><p>\"All participants are compensated. Our current plan is to offer the same compensation to each participant but we may make adjustments as we continue to evaluate the program,\" a spokesperson told the Star. The company's earlier app targeting teens paid $20 gift cards, according to media reports. With Facebook Study, participants have to be 18 or older.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson David Troya-Alvarez said the company is rolling out the new app in India and the United States first.</p><p>\"Depending on the type of research, we may expand the app to other countries,\" said Troya-Alvarez.</p><p>\"Approaching market research in a responsible way is really important,\" said Facebook in a blog post. \"Transparency and handling people's information responsibly have guided how we've built Study from Facebook. We plan to take this same approach going forward with other market research projects that help us understand how people use different products and services.\"</p><p>The Facebook brand has taken a pummeling in Canada from legislators lately.</p><p>Last month, the Canadian government issued a \"standing summons\" to Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg when they ignored a subpoena from the House of Commons ethics committee to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Zuckerberg seems to have gotten the message. He announced at an annual developer's conference that \"The future is private,\" to laughter from the crowd. Zuckerberg quickly acknowledged the skeptism: \"I get that a lot of people aren't sure we are serious about this.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But can you trust them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new \"Study\" app by the tech giant will look at which apps users are interested in, where they're used and how long you spend on them. Facebook says they won't collect user IDs, passwords or messages and the information won't be sold to a third party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, former three-term Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian, in an interview with the Star, says Facebook faces trust issues with the public, and a third party auditor should be used to make sure the company is in compliance.</p><p>\"Given their past history, it doesn't give me a lot of confidence in what they're saying,\" says Cavoukian, executive director of Toronto-based Global Privacy and Security by Design. \"The last time they said they were protecting your information they ended up selling it to a third party.\"</p><p>Federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is suing Facebook over allegedly breaching Canadian privacy laws. A report by the federal and B.C. commissioners found that in a year-long investigation into the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, 87 million users had unknowingly had their personal information harvested.</p><p>The investigation found that not only had Facebook broken Canadian privacy laws, but that it had consistently refused to accept recommendations to rectify the problem.</p><p>Facebook says the new Study app is for \"business and product research\" and that the information will be used to \"learn which apps people value and how they're used.\" The data will likely be used in different ways, including possibly targeting where the audience is for Facebook advertising. Earlier incarnations of Facebook study apps had participants sending in screenshots of Amazon purchases. The company has also used research apps in the past to track potential acquisition targets.</p><p>Facebook and Google take up more than 70 per cent of the digital advertising market using sophisticated analytics to track their audience. A study released this week by the News Media Alliance, which represents U.S.-based newspapers, estimates that Google made $4.7 billion (U.S.) in 2018 alone, almost as much as the entire American news industry.</p><p>However, the online platforms have come under greater scrutiny by legislators over privacy issues for their methods, even as legacy publishers struggle to compete in the marketplace.</p><p>Problematically, the new app released by Facebook comes after it was discovered in January that the platform was running a similar program called Facebook Research that ended up being pulled by Apple.</p><p>The app was similar to another Facebook-owned app called Onavo, where the company used data to gather information about users. That app was pulled in 2018 because Apple said it violated privacy laws after an investigation by online digital magazine TechCrunch. The Study app is available in the Google Play Store, but not the Apple App Store.</p><p>\"Their previous use of data was not fair, not transparent or accountable,\" Cavoukian says of Facebook.</p><p>But the newly released Study app is also problematic. Some experts worry users may not know exactly what they are signing up for.</p><p>\"Facebook is asking for permission to see app activities from other apps that a user may have installed on their phone, and not just the Facebook app,\" says Philip Mai, Director Business and Communications of the Ryerson Social Media Lab at the Ted Rogers School of Management. \"Access to this kind of information can contain important signals about things that a user might want to remain private or keep secret.\"</p><p>However, Mai acknowledges the new app is at least more transparent than what the company had previously offered.</p><p>\"I am glad to see they are offering more transparency, compensating all participants and promising not to reshare the data,\" says Mai.</p><p>\"Privacy is about personal control of your information and there's nothing wrong with getting value for it,\" says Cavoukian. \"Despite my thoughts on compliance, Facebook is at least agreeing to compensate you in this case instead of simply harvesting it and selling it.\"</p><p>Facebook did not outline what the exact remuneration would be for participating.</p><p>\"All participants are compensated. Our current plan is to offer the same compensation to each participant but we may make adjustments as we continue to evaluate the program,\" a spokesperson told the Star. The company's earlier app targeting teens paid $20 gift cards, according to media reports. With Facebook Study, participants have to be 18 or older.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson David Troya-Alvarez said the company is rolling out the new app in India and the United States first.</p><p>\"Depending on the type of research, we may expand the app to other countries,\" said Troya-Alvarez.</p><p>\"Approaching market research in a responsible way is really important,\" said Facebook in a blog post. \"Transparency and handling people's information responsibly have guided how we've built Study from Facebook. We plan to take this same approach going forward with other market research projects that help us understand how people use different products and services.\"</p><p>The Facebook brand has taken a pummeling in Canada from legislators lately.</p><p>Last month, the Canadian government issued a \"standing summons\" to Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg when they ignored a subpoena from the House of Commons ethics committee to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Zuckerberg seems to have gotten the message. He announced at an annual developer's conference that \"The future is private,\" to laughter from the crowd. Zuckerberg quickly acknowledged the skeptism: \"I get that a lot of people aren't sure we are serious about this.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

That app was pulled in 2018 because Apple said it violated privacy laws after an investigation by online digital magazine TechCrunch. The Study app is available in the Google Play Store, but not the Apple App Store.</p><p>\"Their previous use of data was not fair, not transparent or accountable,\" Cavoukian says of Facebook.</p><p>But the newly released Study app is also problematic. Some experts worry users may not know exactly what they are signing up for.</p><p>\"Facebook is asking for permission to see app activities from other apps that a user may have installed on their phone, and not just the Facebook app,\" says Philip Mai, Director Business and Communications of the Ryerson Social Media Lab at the Ted Rogers School of Management. \"Access to this kind of information can contain important signals about things that a user might want to remain private or keep secret.\"</p><p>However, Mai acknowledges the new app is at least more transparent than what the company had previously offered.</p><p>\"I am glad to see they are offering more transparency, compensating all participants and promising not to reshare the data,\" says Mai.</p><p>\"Privacy is about personal control of your information and there's nothing wrong with getting value for it,\" says Cavoukian. \"Despite my thoughts on compliance, Facebook is at least agreeing to compensate you in this case instead of simply harvesting it and selling it.\"</p><p>Facebook did not outline what the exact remuneration would be for participating.</p><p>\"All participants are compensated. Our current plan is to offer the same compensation to each participant but we may make adjustments as we continue to evaluate the program,\" a spokesperson told the Star. The company's earlier app targeting teens paid $20 gift cards, according to media reports. With Facebook Study, participants have to be 18 or older.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson David Troya-Alvarez said the company is rolling out the new app in India and the United States first.</p><p>\"Depending on the type of research, we may expand the app to other countries,\" said Troya-Alvarez.</p><p>\"Approaching market research in a responsible way is really important,\" said Facebook in a blog post. \"Transparency and handling people's information responsibly have guided how we've built Study from Facebook. We plan to take this same approach going forward with other market research projects that help us understand how people use different products and services.\"</p><p>The Facebook brand has taken a pummeling in Canada from legislators lately.</p><p>Last month, the Canadian government issued a \"standing summons\" to Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg when they ignored a subpoena from the House of Commons ethics committee to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Zuckerberg seems to have gotten the message. He announced at an annual developer's conference that \"The future is private,\" to laughter from the crowd. Zuckerberg quickly acknowledged the skeptism: \"I get that a lot of people aren't sure we are serious about this.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm Robert Siegel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MELISSA BLOCK: I'm Melissa Block. And it's time now for a new version of All Tech Considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MELISSA BLOCK: We're hitting refresh on the segment, taking you into the changing landscape of technology and how it intersects with everyday life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT SIEGEL: From Silicon Valley to China, we'll feature stories from around the world, and we're also looking for more feedback and ideas from you. Every Monday, we'll preview the week's big tech stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MELISSA BLOCK: Today, Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>turns 28, and he'll be getting the ultimate birthday gift. His popular social networking site is expected to go public later this week. The IPO could be valued at nearly $100 billion. Also, over the weekend, Yahoo's newly appointed CEO, Scott Thompson, stepped down.</p><p>For more on both stories, we're joined by NPR's Silicon Valley correspondent, Steve Henn, who's in Menlo Park today. That's the small city where Facebook is based.</p><p>And, Steve, for non-techies, one of the things that's so remarkable about Facebook is how quickly it became so valuable. But it does raise the question: Can a company that started less than a decade ago in a college dorm really be worth $100 billion?</p><p>STEVE HENN: Well, that's a great question. And to put that in perspective, when Facebook goes public, it will probably be valued at more than Boeing and Ford combined. But Facebook's earnings, it's actual profits, when you compare them to the profits of companies like Boeing and Ford, they're tiny. They're miniscule. So to justify its sky-high stock price, Facebook will need to grow like a weed for the next few years.</p><p>The amount of money it brings in will have to double, and then double again, and then maybe double again for this deal to make sense for long-term investors.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: And how is Facebook going to achieve that level of growth, and what would that mean for the hundreds of millions of people who use it?</p><p>STEVE HENN: Well, right now, Facebook makes most of its money comes from advertising. More than 80 percent comes from that source. So that piece of its business is going to need to expand pretty quickly. But Facebook doesn't want to clutter up its site with too many ads and annoy its users. And so late last week, Facebook gave us one hint about where it might be headed.</p><p>The company has a huge amount of data about each of its users. It knows what you like. It knows who your friends are, maybe where you went to college. And right now, it uses that data to sell ads aimed at you, but those ads only appear on its own website. Friday, it tweaked its privacy policy. So going forward, it'll be able to use that information to place ads aimed at users anywhere on the Web.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: And that sounds, Steve, like the kind of thing that will really annoy Facebook fans more than they already have been.</p><p>STEVE HENN: Well, that's true. You know, managing privacy expectations of its users has been a big problem for Facebook, and I think it probably will remain one going forward. The company has a long history of pushing people to share more and more information about themselves, more information than they might be comfortable sharing. And there is no indication that trend's going to change. So there's always the chance that Facebook could go too far, and millions of people could start quitting in droves.</p><p>You know, so far, that hasn't happened. But there are other risks as well. Regulators, either here or in Europe, could get tough. Facebook's already landed in hot water in both places. So Facebook has to walk this line. While at the same time trying to convince people to share more information, attract new users, do that without running afoul with the law or really freaking us all out.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: And if they can't figure that out, what happens then?</p><p>STEVE HENN: Well, that could be really bad news for investors. You know, investors who buy Facebook this week and plan to own this stock for the long haul are betting on a kind of crazy, almost unprecedented type of growth. And because of that, without that kind of growth, Facebook begins to look a lot like another Silicon Valley company, Yahoo.</p><p>Yahoo sells more ads than Facebook does right now. Both companies measure their audience in the hundreds of millions. But Yahoo stock is worth just one-fifth of what Facebook's is.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: And, Steve, let's talk about the recent news with Yahoo. Its new CEO, Scott Thompson, was just pushed out. He was hired less than six months ago. What happened to him?</p><p>STEVE HENN: Well, the short answer is that Scott Thompson got caught fibbing about his background. In SEC documents and on his bio, he claimed that he had a degree in computer science when, in fact, his college degree was in accounting. When the news first broke, Thompson claimed it was all a misunderstanding, that he had never actually lied.</p><p>But the more folks dug into that, the less credible it looked. Then over the weekend, Thompson reportedly told the board he had recently been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and he stepped down.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: It's a company, Yahoo, that's gone through a lot of CEOs in just the last five years, right?</p><p>STEVE HENN: That's right. Depending on your count, it's four to six. And actually, Thompson being pushed out is a bigger story than Yahoo losing just another CEO. A group of hostile investors had dug up the information about Thompson that may have led to his resignation. And they used this controversy to land three seats on Yahoo's board of directors. In the past, this group has pushed to break Yahoo up or try to force the board to sell it.</p><p>So, really, this is a company whose future is now in doubt. And this week, as Facebook goes public, it's worth remembering that, at one point, Wall Street valued Yahoo at more than $100 billion too.</p><p>MELISSA BLOCK: OK.

The FT\u2019s scoop that Facebook is close to a big deal in India stands as evidence that big investments are still in play. Elsewhere, though, the virus is starting to take a heavy toll. Huawei\u2019s smartphone business is being hit hard. Toyota, SoftBank and Samsung have been affected in different ways. Hopes for an effective drug, Avigan, pushed Fujifilm\u2019s share price into gyrations.

The company published an update [1]on June 30 to a civil rights audit, but it has not provided any details about a parallel probe dealing with allegations of anti-conservative bias. Facebook's apparent foot-dragging comes as President Donald Trump and other conservatives consider whether big tech needs more scrutiny. </p><p>A Facebook representative told Politico reporters[2] in 2018 that the company would complete the audit and publish findings 'early next year.' Facebook has not yet responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment(Article Continues Below Advertisement) The updated civil rights audit was conducted by various civil rights group and contained some eye-raising suggestions. For one, auditors suggested Facebook's current ban of explicit white nationalism should be expanded to include content that supports the ideology even if the term white nationalism is not used. The company banned[3]explicit expressions of white nationalism in March, marking a significant change in policy governing content on the platform. Tech experts worry the Facebook's algorithms are incapable of distinguishing the subtle differences between so-called borderline white supremacist content and legitimate conservative posts. Facebook's blunt instruments are not good at making such distinctions, experts say.[4] Trump and Republican lawmakers are fleshing out ways[5] to reign in Facebook, Google and Twitter before they become too big to regulate. They're worried Facebook is indiscriminately and unfairly de-platforming numerous conservative voices.(Article Continues Below Advertisement)  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The company spent most of the year explaining how it exposed 126 million Americans[1] to thousands of Russian-linked pages, which were part of the Kremlin's efforts to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. As a result, Facebook's reputation took a major hit, and it put the social-media giant under the US government's microscope[2]. Talks of tougher federal regulation[3] suddenly grew in Congress, which doesn't bode well for Facebook. If the company thought 2017 was bad, well, the following year turned out to be a nightmare.During the first few months of 2018, a huge data-privacy breach affected millions of Facebook users. </p><p>In March, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica (CA)[4] had harvested users' personal data without their consent, using a Facebook app it had created called thisisyourdigitalife. Developers collecting private information, such as email address or birthdate, is not uncommon, but CA was using it without users' knowledge for political research. In April, Facebook announced that CA actually may have had up to 87 million users' data[5], many more than the number originally reported.To make matters worse, Facebook allegedly knew what Cambridge Analytica had done in the run-up to the US elections but chose not to disclose it[6]. It wasn't until a joint story broke by The New York Times, The Guardian and The Observer that the company came forward and shared more information about the incident. Facebook said calling CA's actions a breach was \"completely false,\" since the users who were affected had chosen to sign up to use thisisyourdigitalife, but that doesn't make it any better. It also doesn't explain why Facebook waited two years to disclose that any of this had taken place.Not surprisingly, the Cambridge Analytica don't-call-it-a-breach comment raised even more alarms in Washington, D.C, as well as with other governments around the world. A month after we found out about CA, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to testify in Congress, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.For the most part, Zuckerberg's congressional hearings were a wasted opportunity[7]: We didn't learn any new, important information about Cambridge Analytica or Russian interference on Facebook. Instead, some US Senators and House Representatives spent most of their time accusing Facebook of political bias against conservatives, rather than focusing on the matters at hand. But, if anything, Zuckerberg being grilled on Capitol Hill[8] at least signaled how the government now has Facebook under close watch. \"Unless there are specific rules from an outside agency,\" Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told Zuckerberg, \"I don't see how you can change your business model to maximize profit over privacy.\"Over the course of the year, the scrutiny only got worse for Facebook. Its WhatsApp messaging service was accused of inciting genocide in Myanmar, and the examples of how bad actors can abuse its platforms just kept piling on. And there's no better example of this than the spread of misinformation on Facebook led by right-wing conspiracy theorists and propagandists like Alex Jones[9].In July, Facebook came under fire for refusing to ban Jones from the site, despite his history of promoting fake news through his page and that of his InfoWars publication. Eventually, not long after first suspending his account for 30 days, Facebook did shut down four of Jones' pages[10], citing repeated violations of its hate-speech policies. The company said that more of his content had been reported and, upon further review, it took Jones' page down for \"using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\"Perhaps it took Facebook longer than it should have to ban Jones, but the company made the right move to do so. Even so, the company's approach to fighting fake news seems to be half-hearted[11]. It wants to stop misinformation from spreading, yet it doesn't want to be the \"arbiter of truth.\" Rather than remove fake news stories from the site altogether, Facebook's plan is to reduce and flag them so that users are aware when an article isn't based on facts. But truth shouldn't be subjective, and Facebook would likely be better off taking a tougher stance on misinformation posts.Just when you thought Facebook was catching a break, it disclosed a security issue that exposed the private data of 29 million users[12], of which 14 million had very detailed information about their lives stolen. The data breach, which was revealed in October, was caused by a bug in Facebook's site that allowed hackers to access people's name and contact details, as well as their username, gender, birthdate, location, language, relationship status, religion, hometown, current city, education and work. Additionally, the breach gave access to places users had checked in at or were tagged, plus the websites, people and pages they followed, and their most recent searches on Facebook and the type of device they used to login. Yikes. \"We need more than consumer outrage to put checks and balances on Facebook and every other company that profits from our data.\" Then, just last week, Facebook revealed yet another bug[13] that let third-party apps access unposted photos of nearly seven million users. Yowza. What's most concerning about the latest incident is that Facebook knew about it in September, and it's just now letting users know. If the company hopes to repair its image, taking three months to disclose a security issue isn't the best way to accomplish that. \"Facebook's reputation is in a death spiral, but I'm not convinced it even matters,\" said Will Potter, a lecturer and fake news expert at the University of Michigan. \"Facebook's power doesn't come from trust, but from its ubiquity. My real fear is that we're all growing numb to these violations of our privacy, and we're also bound to the big tech companies who are violating us.\"Potter said that society has become too invested socially, professionally and financially in tech companies like Facebook -- and that might be the biggest problem. \"We need more than consumer outrage to put checks and balances on Facebook and every other company that profits from our data,\" he said. \"We have to keep in mind that most people either don't know about what Facebook has done, or they don't understand the significance. The people who are outraged are those paying attention to privacy issues, civil liberties, surveillance... and that's not a demographic Facebook would even attempt to win over.\"Would government oversight fix Facebook's troubles? That's hard to say. It's too early to tell whether laws like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives users more control of their data[14] and demands that companies disclose data breaches within 72 hours, will keep Facebook under control. Here in the US, though, there are experts who believe regulation won't solve anything. \"Regulation of Facebook by the government is a terrible idea,\" said Paul Levinson, a professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University. \"[It's] ipso facto unconstitutional, a clear violation of the First Amendment and its insistence that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.'\"That doesn't mean Congress won't try, however. \"I suppose a bill attempting some sort of regulation of Facebook might be proposed and get passed in the House, but it won't get through the Senate,\" said Levinson. \"And, if it does, the Supreme Court will strike it down, just as it did the Communications Decency Act in the late 1990s.\" For those who don't know, the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) was an attempt by Congress to regulate pornographic content on the internet, but the Supreme Court ruled that the censorship law was unconstitutional.Whatever may happen, being in the minds of governments all over the world isn't a position Facebook wants to be in. Sure, the company is still raking in billions of dollars in revenue every quarter, but its growth is starting to slow down. Maybe that's a sign that Facebook's endless mistakes[15] are, slowly but surely, catching up with it.Images: Facebook (\"L\" watermark by Koren Shadmi) This article originally appeared on Engadget at

Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the major Facebook headlines, month by month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook announced it was altering its news feed algorithm to prioritize posts from friends and family over \u201cpublic content\u201d from brands, publishers and businesses. The change sent shockwaves through the media industry, and some publishers who relied heavily on Facebook saw negative effects to referral traffic.\u00a0One publisher of Facebook-friendly content, LittleThings, shut down in March,\u00a0blaming the algorithm change for its demise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thirteen Russians and three companies were indicted in an ongoing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Part of that indictment included a nugget about more than $100,000 that the accused spent on Facebook to run ads critical of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Enter Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ads, who said this in response to the news: \u201cMost of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d</p><p>On a late night in March, Facebook announced it had suspended a little-known data analytics firm that had worked with the Trump campaign. The vague blog post about the firm\u2019s suspension came just hours before The New York Times and The Guardian reported that the firm, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or consent to help build a powerful political influencing tool.</p><p>Facebook first threatened to sue Guardian journalists for their reporting and then downplayed the extent of the breach to reporters prior to the reports\u2019 publication. In a post five days after the news broke, Zuckerberg said, \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can\u2019t then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you.\u201d</p><p>As some users began downloading and deleting their Facebook accounts in a #DeleteFacebook protest, some learned the full extent of Facebook\u2019s data-harvesting practices,\u00a0including that Facebook was logging the incoming and outgoing calls and text messages of some users.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook and its messaging app WhatsApp were banned in Sri Lanka after hate speech on the platforms fueled anti-Muslim riots. The United Nations, investigating ethnic violence in Myanmar, said hate speech and violence on Facebook was a factor. And BuzzFeed News reported that Facebook vp Andrew Bosworth once wrote that Facebook would connect people even if \u201cit costs a lift by exposing someone to bullies\u201d or if \u201csomeone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of WhatsApp, one of the app\u2019s co-founders\u2014Brian Acton, who left Facebook in 2017\u2014told Facebook users to delete their Facebook accounts.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica news was worse than originally reported. Facebook said 87 million people had their personal information accessed, nearly twice as much as had previously been disclosed.</p><p>Zuckerberg testified before senators and Congress to face questions about the company\u2019s business practices and its approach to collecting and handling personal data. The testimony revealed that some sitting lawmakers were not particularly knowledgeable about how big tech operates, but some lawmakers began to lay the groundwork for possible regulations and antitrust actions. And Zuckerberg failed to answer some basic questions from lawmakers, often saying he\u2019d get back to them later.</p><p>In other news, at the end of the month, WhatsApp founder Jan Koum said he would leave the company.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica fallout continued, as Zuckerberg testified before European lawmakers. This hearing focused far more on data privacy and regulation than the U.S. hearings, pushed on questions about Facebook\u2019s power in the marketplace and asked whether Cambridge Analytica was the tip of the iceberg when it came to revelations about misuse of personal data.</p><p>On May 25, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation went into effect. Facebook, along with its subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp, were immediately sued over their policies around getting permission from users to collect personal information.</p><p>The New York Times reported that Facebook, in an effort to bring more mobile users to the platform, had struck special data-sharing arrangements with tech manufactures like Amazon, Apple and Samsung, along with Chinese device manufacturers with ties to the Chinese government. The reports prompted criticism from lawmakers.</p><p>A week later, Facebook chief privacy officer Erin Egan said 14 million Facebook users had been affected by a bug that affected users\u2019 default privacy settings and recommended that posts be made \u201cpublic.\u201d</p><p>More than 800,000 users were affected by yet another privacy-related bug on Facebook. The bug enabled blocked users to temporarily be unblocked, giving them the ability to see content they had previously been blocked from accessing or message users who had blocked them. Then, British regulators said they would fine Facebook the maximum amount the law allowed over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>At the end of the month, Facebook reported disappointing quarterly earnings and said its revenue growth would likely slow in the coming months. The news prompted Facebook\u2019s stock value to drop by nearly 25 percent,\u00a0and after its market cap plunged by $119 billion, the loss marked a record single-day loss in market value for a public company in U.S. history.</p><p>Plus, the company struggled to contain the spread of hoax WhatsApp messages in India, which were blamed for a series of lynchings.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development filed a formal complaint against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act through its advertising platform. HUD said Facebook had allowed companies to target housing ads in a discriminatory manner by specifying who could see the ads based on gender, race, ethnicity and religion. A few days later, Facebook substantially scaled back its targeting capabilities on the platform.</p><p>In mid-August, the company also had to respond to a brief hacking episode that affected some Instagram users who were bumped out of their accounts.</p><p>Legal complaints kept on coming in September. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Communications Workers of America filed a lawsuit against the social media company, saying that Facebook\u2019s job application tool was discriminatory. \u00a0Plus, content moderators who worked for Facebook filed a class-action lawsuit saying that the company did not do enough to protect them from post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological trauma from viewing and moderating posts that contained graphic imagery.</p><p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, during which she was grilled about the site\u2019s targeted advertising capabilities and how it was addressing misinformation and hate speech.</p><p>Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the co-founders of Instagram, abruptly announced\u00a0they would leave the photo-sharing app. The departures were the latest in a line of high-profile departures from Facebook, including the company\u2019s CMO, corporate comms head, vice president of partnerships and general counsel.</p><p>At the end of September, Facebook disclosed a bug it said exposed the personal information of tens of millions of users to hackers. Facebook clarified in mid-October that 30 million Facebook users had their personal information stolen by hackers, a little lower than it originally estimated.</p><p>A group of digital marketers alleged that Facebook had inflated its video ad metrics by as much as 900 percent,\u00a0claims Facebook denied. Some marketers increased their calls for Facebook to implement a third-party measuring system instead of self-reporting.</p><p>There was also another high-profile departure. Brendan Iribe, the founder of the virtual reality platform Oculus, said he would leave the Facebook-owned company to \u201crecharge.\u201d</p><p>A New York Times report detailed the private and public actions Facebook took in the wake of ongoing crises at the company, attracting a new wave of criticism. The company faced intense scrutiny for how it enlisted the help of an opposition research firm to smear Facebook critics, including Democratic financier George Soros, who has been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.</p><p>In the wake of the report, lawmakers intensified calls for regulation.\u00a0\u201cFacebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\u201d said Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline.</p><p>Former Facebook manager Mark Luckie, an advocate for diversity in tech, published his outgoing memo from the company in which he criticized Facebook\u2019s treatment of black employees and black users.</p><p>An ongoing lawsuit against Facebook brought by third-party app developer Six4Three began to play out in the public sphere after British lawmakers got their hands on court documents that had been sealed by a U.S. judge. The documents showed how Facebook employees considered charging app developers for access to user data and showed how Facebook moved swiftly to squash competitor social media platforms, including the beloved, now-defunct video app Vine.</p><p>The document dump from the lawsuit brought by Six4Three continued, and Facebook struggled to contain the fallout.</p><p>Facebook also disclosed that up to 6.8 million users who had loaded pictures into a Facebook browser but didn\u2019t upload or share them may have had those images shared with app developers anyway due to a bug.</p><p>Two Senate reports showed how Russians were using Facebook to target black Americans\u00a0and that Instagram was becoming Russian operatives\u2019 new favorite disinformation tool. The NAACP called for a weeklong digital boycott of Facebook.</p><p>Then, another Times bombshell\u00a0building on Wall Street Journal reporting from earlier in the year: Facebook had been sharing more user information with its partners than it had previously disclosed. There was also a BuzzFeed News report that Facebook-compatible apps had been streaming personal data to Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. Some high-profile media figures said they were leaving the platform for good.

The more governments support each other, the more effective they will be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So good on Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault for denouncing the threats directed at the Australian government as it pushes ahead with plans to make Facebook and Google compensate news outlets for news items they post on their platforms.</p><p>Facebook has taken the lead in attacking Australia's move on this front, threatening to pull Australian news off its platform and from Instagram, which it also owns. The company is behaving like a global bully that simply doesn't care what petty local authorities do. No government should bow to that kind of pressure.</p><p>All this makes it even more important for Ottawa to follow through with its promise to bring in legislation this fall to deal with the challenge of the foreign-owned digital giants that up to now have been taking a lot more from Canada than they contribute.</p><p>It's not clear exactly what Guilbeault has in mind when he talks about bringing in a \"made in Canada solution.\" But he does say he has been closely following the examples of Australia and France, where regulators are pressing the social-media companies to pay for the news they post.</p><p>And Guilbeault's words are promising. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he says. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content... That includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities.\"</p><p>That's a very welcome change from the way the Trudeau government approached the issue until a year or so ago - essentially standing on the sidelines while other countries pushed back against Big Tech.</p><p>Guilbeault has sounded a new note, one more in line with the approach set out in January by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by the government itself. It proposed a series of recommendations designed to make sure the digital giants contribute a lot more to the system they profit from so generously.</p><p>They included ways the government could help to foster a \"strong, financially stable\" news sector by, among other things, ensuring that news creators \"are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>That's the basic direction Australia is going. The government there at first proposed a voluntary code to govern the relationship between the news industry and digital companies. But when that didn't work out it asked its competition regulator to develop a mandatory code. Google and Facebook will have to negotiate deals with news companies to pay for content, or face penalties.</p><p>The digital giants, no surprise, argue that all this is unfair and say they benefit the news industry as much as it benefits them. And with the threat of government action in the background, they've introduced various programs to help struggling news organizations keep producing local journalism.</p><p>But the amount and quality of information available to citizens shouldn't depend on the largesse of Google, Facebook and the like. The digital platforms have been \"making billions of dollars off the back of original content producers,\" in the words of an open letter to the Trudeau government issued in May by Canada's major newspaper publishers (including, full disclosure, the company that owns the Toronto Star).</p><p>The government, through Guilbeault, has promised action this fall to tame the power of the digital giants. The threats issued by Facebook &amp;amp; Co. against its counterpart in Australia should not deter it. On the contrary, they should stiffen the government's resolve to act.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020090258765893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RP-7D31-JDH1-C09B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

I know too much about extortion.\" So said Tony Soprano.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is channelling the notorious TV gangster with his threat to prevent Australians from viewing or posting domestic or international news on his platform. Mr. Zuckerberg's threat is in response to a proposed law that would force him to start paying for news that appears on Facebook.</p><p>It is no coincidence that Facebook is going all out to protect its ability to take news content without consent or compensation from outlets that produce it. Facebook competes with newspapers and broadcasters for advertising sales, and selling ads against content your competitors spend money to produce is a lucrative racket. Having to pay these suppliers would obviously hurt profits.</p><p>Facebook has another incentive to keep journalists under its thumb. This rogue company's most glaring misdeeds have been revealed by - you guessed it - journalists, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/privacy-watchdog-cambridge-analytica-facebook-1.5110304\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/privacy-watchdog-cambridge-analytica-facebook-1.5110304</url> and likely contributed to the 2016 election of Donald Trump, complicity in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy</url>, knowingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499</url>, knowingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/147486/facebook-genocide-problem\">https://newrepublic.com/article/147486/facebook-genocide-problem</url>, helping advertisers target COVID-19 scams to people <url normalizedValue=\"https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2020/04/23/want-to-find-a-misinformed-public-facebooks-already-done-it\">https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2020/04/23/want-to-find-a-misinformed-public-facebooks-already-done-it</url> and allowing advertisers to hide employment and housing ads from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\">https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://thelogic.co/news/big-tech/facebook-allowed-housing-and-employment-advertisers-to-exclude-users-with-indigenous-interests/\">https://thelogic.co/news/big-tech/facebook-allowed-housing-and-employment-advertisers-to-exclude-users-with-indigenous-interests/</url> people, to name but a few. These scandals have led to criminal, tax and regulatory actions in multiple countries, all of which threaten Facebook's ability to intimidate governments, as it is now trying to do in Australia. They also reveal the essential value of journalism to democracy.</p><p>Facebook is on an irreversible collision course with democracy. The company's highly profitable but fundamentally anti-democratic practices include enabling campaign-finance fraud, spreading messages that encourage people to shoot peaceful protesters and allowing politicians to grossly and perhaps fatally undermine the legitimacy of democratic elections.</p><p>What was once a backroom power play is now a full-blown public war. Facebook's brazen standoff with the Australian government puts its disdain for democracy on display. By using its historically unparallelled powers of influence and manipulation to turn citizens against their own governments, Facebook is sending a clear message to democracies everywhere: regulate us at your peril.</p><p>Forcing Facebook to pay for the news content it sells is a fair, productive and necessary step, but this measure alone will not resuscitate journalism. The news industry is what doctors call \"a complex patient;\" it suffers from multiple ailments, many self-inflicted.</p><p>But even solving part of the problem is surely better than leaving it to metastasize. Canada has lost more than 16,000 journalists since 2006 - more than a third of the profession. Since the pandemic struck, at least 3,000 more journalism jobs have disappeared. Hundreds of outlets have reduced service or shuttered their operations. A recent report shows advertising revenues down more than 50 per cent.</p><p>If we want to sustain journalism, we need to ensure that journalists are paid for their vital work. No other company (apart from Google, which is also mentioned in the proposed Australian regulations) would get away with taking news content without payment or permission.</p><p>Canada should follow Australia's lead - and quickly - if for no other reason than to stand up to Mr. Zuckerberg's arrogance and remind Facebook that the laws of democratic states are non-negotiable. Truly sovereign states don't bow to corporate threats.</p><p>Ultimately, this is about more than journalism. The real question is who's in charge: democratically elected governments in Canberra and Ottawa or seditious billionaires like Mr. Zuckerberg, who no longer bother with even the faintest pretense of bowing to the people's authority?</p><p>Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

It broke the patience of politicians and regulators, to be sure. It also broke the sense of complacency that we, as ordinary Facebook users, have in its promise to look after our personal information.</p><p>I'm conscious that even after a week of headlines, many people may not have picked up exactly what happened.</p><p>So to recap in one sentence: Facebook stood by and didn't clamp down when a company called Cambridge Analytica used personal information from up to 50 million people to target them for the election of Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>While the technical issue at stake is Cambridge Analytica's duplicity, (it turned a personality test database into a political sentiment repository) the underlying problem is a reminder of just how much Facebook scrapes away at our personal lives, turning our daily movements into fodder for ad companies. It's not yet clear how much we care. The vast majority of pundits and privacy experts say that ordinary people will have been shocked to learn that Facebook 'likes' and preferences are flipped around in this way.</p><p>There's also a #DeleteFacebook campaign under way on rival social media platforms, especially Twitter.</p><p>But it remains to be seen how many of the two million Irish people who use Facebook every day will suddenly stop using the service.</p><p>I'd be surprised if even 1pc do this. Facebook has become too embedded as a utility in our daily lives.</p><p>And I simply don't believe that people are as naive and unwitting as experts charge. Every year there are multiple scandals that highlight Facebook's data-sharing proclivities.</p><p>I'd wager that the majority of those who use Facebook know that they're giving away monetisable personal information and just don't really care.</p><p>What may be different about this case is that the by-product of the illicit data sharing may have been the election of Trump. (Because the ill-gotten Facebook friends information was used to create databases for serving ads.) This has probably been the real fuel ADRIAN WECKLER behind the outrage over the issue.</p><p>And Facebook's response has been the same as it ever is. Like other big tech companies, Facebook has three stages of dealing with a crisis: 1. Minimise or deny the accusation, claiming no-one else understands the technology.</p><p>2. Threaten to sue the publication (as with the Guardian).</p><p>3. Back down with phrases such as \"We should have done a better job\" and \"We're now taking action\" (as Zuckerberg did after days of Facebook's value falling by (EURO)50bn).</p><p>That said, some point to conspiracy theories around the controversy.</p><p>One is political reaction, which has been curiously lopsided. In the US, the lion's share of the calls for action to curb data-sharing on Facebook are coming from the Democratic Party.</p><p>One obvious reason is that the Cambridge Analytica activity benefited Trump in the last election.</p><p>But others have pointed out a strategic reason. The Democrats, via the Obama campaign in 2012 and subsequent political initiatives, used very similar techniques to the ones under the spotlight now. At the time, it was regarded as 'innovative', not creepy, because it was helping to elect a good guy.</p><p>But the point is that they stole a campaigning march on their Republican opponents. And now that they have all of that information (and retain it), there may be a natural instinct to prevent their Republican rivals from continuing to get access to the same powerful campaigning tools, especially as it clearly works, as in the case of Trump.</p><p>This was as much as admitted by the former 'Obama for America' director of integration and media analytics, Carol Davidsen, two years ago.</p><p>\"The Republicans never built an app to do that,\" she told the Personal Democracy Forum in 2015.</p><p>\"So the data is out there, you can't take it back. The Democrats have this information, so when they look at a voter file and someone comes to them, they can immediately say, 'Oh, here are all of the other people they know, and here are people that they can help us persuade, because they are really good friends with this person'.</p><p>\"The Republicans do not have that information and will not get that information. Now I'm a Democrat so maybe I could argue that's a great thing, but really it's not in the overall process. That wasn't thought all the way through. Now there's a disadvantage of information that to me seems unfair. But I'm not Facebook, so this is the reality.\"</p><p>Remember that the only real hostility to Obama's campaign mining personal data in this way came from a handful of right-wing websites and vocational privacy campaigners (many of whom tempered their anger because of the candidate gaining from it).</p><p>But now that Trump is the beneficiary, it's a very different story altogether. In the UK, there's a somewhat similar context. The most trenchant criticism has come from political parties and media outlets who wonder if the techniques were used to help bring about the political issue they most oppose - Brexit. By contrast, the Conservative Party and pro-Brexit media have found it harder to articulate the absolute reason why this is such a bad thing - maybe because it hasn't resulted in a political outcome they themselves mind. Even the right-wing newspapers, which hate Facebook and Google for reasons more to do with the advertising market, have not joined in quite as much.</p><p>Facebook will remain in the dock.

Stretch admitted \"there were signals we missed,\" like the use of Russian rubles to purchase political ads. He said that Facebook had no knowledge of any outside help the Russian actors\u00a0could have had to target members of its 2-billion-user network. </p><p>Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch\u00a0told lawmakers on Tuesday that the\u00a0company\u00a0should have done more to prevent Russia-backed propaganda from spreading on its platform around the 2016\u00a0US presidential election. 'I think in hindsight, we should have had a broader lens,\" he said with regard to Facebook's\u00a0efforts to weed out politically-charged ads from fake accounts. \"There were signals we missed.' Along with representatives from Google and Twitter, Facebook's Stretch appeared Tuesday before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to testify about state-sponsored meddling\u00a0in US\u00a0politics through\u00a0social networks.\u00a0 At one point during the contentious two-and-a-half-hour hearing, Senator Al Franken pressed Stretch to explain why Facebook took nearly\u00a0a full year to disclose that Russian-affiliated\u00a0actors had\u00a0paid for targeted, politically-charged ads in rubles. 'Mr. Stretch, how did Facebook, which prides itself on being able to process billions of data points and instantly transform them into personal connections for its users, somehow not make the connection that electoral ads paid for in rubles were not coming from Russia?' Franken asked. 'It's a signal we should have been alert to, and in hindsight, it's one we missed,\" said Stretch.'You were the canary in the coal mine\" Franken called Facebook \"the canary in the coal mine\" for Russia's\u00a02016 efforts to sway political opinion in the US through\u00a0internet propaganda, a revelation that has led some senators to propose legislation that would force the disclosure[1] of who paid for political ads online. He asked Stretch if Facebook would be willing, in light of its Russian ads, to block political ads from being purchased with foreign currencies like the North Korean won. While Stretch said Facebook prohibited \"political advertising by foreign actors,\" he declined to say whether the company would keep certain currencies from being used to purchase political ads.\u00a0\"It's a signal, but it's not enough,\" he said. \"My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little better,\" Franken said at a more heated moment in the exchange. Another member of the subcommittee, Senator\u00a0Richard Blumenthal, asked Stretch if he knew whether any other parties, like a\u00a0political campaign, helped the Russian-affiliated Internet Research Agency[2] target the posts that Facebook estimated to have reached 126 million Americans[3]. \"We're not able to essentially see behind the accounts,\" said Stretch. \"All\u00a0we're able to get is the targeting information, which we've provided to the committee.' Since Facebook disclosed in September[4] that fake, Russia-linked accounts purchased ads on its platform, reports have shown how Russia-backed operatives used the social network to spread fake news, sow divisiveness, and even organize real-world political protests[5]. Facebook has roughly 10,000 staffers working on safety and security issues and it said it plans to double that headcount by the end of 2018. During\u00a0Tuesday's hearing, Stretch revealed that most of the Russia-backed ads were used to drive more followers to affiliated\u00a0Facebook pages that shared unpaid posts. Researchers have estimated[6] that so-called organic posts\u00a0by Russian actors reached significantly more people than online ads.NOW WATCH: SCOTT GALLOWAY: Facebook could screen its advertisers,

nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think in hindsight, we should have had a broader lens,\" he said with regard to Facebook's\u00a0efforts to weed out politically-charged ads from fake accounts. \"There were

state-sponsored meddling\u00a0in US\u00a0politics through\u00a0social networks.\u00a0</p><p>At one point during the contentious two-and-a-half-hour hearing, Senator Al Franken pressed Stretch to explain why Facebook took nearly\u00a0a full year to disclose that Russian-affiliated\u00a0actors had\u00a0paid for targeted, politically-charged ads in rubles.</p><p>\"Mr. Stretch, how did Facebook,

with foreign currencies like the North Korean won.</p><p>While Stretch said Facebook prohibited \"political advertising by foreign actors,\" he declined to say whether the company would keep certain currencies from being used to purchase political ads.\u00a0\"It's a signal, but it's not enough,\" he said.</p><p>\"My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little better,\" Franken said at a

Continue reading Facebook's total focus on privacy could crowd out more important issues</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">F8 is a conference where Facebook executives talk about the future   and at Facebook, the future is flexible. In 2015, the future was video. The next year, the future was bots. The year after that, the future was augmented reality   and also a project to let you hear with your skin. All of those technologies eventually found their way into Facebook's products, in some form   well, all except the skin hearing thing. But none really shifted the company away from its core product: an infinitely scrolling feed of updates interrupted with highly targeted advertising.</p><p>This year, the company sought to break with that tradition. Nearly every speaker at today's F8 keynote, starting with Mark Zuckerberg, repeated a version of the phrase  the future is private.  Since Zuckerberg announced Facebook's pivot toward private messaging last month, I've argued that the move represents a fundamental transformation of the company. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg sought to convince the world   and skeptics inside his own company   that he's serious.</p><p>One way he did that was through product launches. Zuckerberg's vision for a new Facebook is perhaps best represented by a coming redesign of the flagship app and desktop site that will emphasize events and groups, at the expense of the News Feed. Collectively, the design changes will push people toward smaller group conversations and real-world meetups   and away from public posts. Zuckerberg's new vision also appears in the large number of announcements related to messaging: a desktop version of Messenger; a redesigned mobile app built for speed; and a version of WhatsApp for Facebook's Portal home speaker.</p><p>Just as important, though, is the way he talked about all these launches: as the foundation of what he repeatedly called Facebook's  next chapter.   Over time I believe that a private social platform will be even more important in our lives than our digital town squares,  he said during his keynote.  So today we're going to talk about what this could look like as a product, what it means to have the center of your social experience be more private, [and] how we need to change the way we run this company in order to build this. </p><p>One thing Zuckerberg did not discuss on Tuesday in any detail is the considerations that led him to move away from the public broadcast model of social networking. But he gave the broad outlines to Mike Isaac in the New York Times:</p><p> By far, the three fastest-growing areas of online communication are private messaging, groups and Stories,  Mr. Zuckerberg said.  In 2019, we expect the amount of Stories that are shared to outnumber the amount of Feed posts that are shared. </p><p>One way of looking at Facebook in this moment is as an unstoppable behemoth that bends reality to its will, no matter the consequences. (This is how many journalists tend to see it.) Another way of looking at the company is from the perspective of its fundamental weakness   as a slave to ever-shifting consumer behavior. (This is how employees are more likely to look at it.)</p><p>In the short term, Facebook's strength is undeniable. The company is earning record profits, usage of its products is at an all-time high, and it continues to find new users around the world. But in his interview with the Times, Zuckerberg admits that the writing is on the wall. If the company wants to remain dominant, it has to refocus.</p><p>Last week, before he turned his attention to narrowly company-focused issues, Zuckerberg sat down with historian Yuval Noah Harari to talk about the effect of social networks on society at large. Yesterday in this space, I wrote about some of the questions that the historian asked the CEO:</p><p>Does Facebook want to  connect  people for any particular purpose, or simply to keep them looking at a screen? How do you build a social network that improves cohesion among people around the world, rather than erodes it? How do you build artificial intelligence systems that don't serve as tools of surveillance and control? Is the internet economy undermining human agency and democracy?</p><p>These are heady subjects, and any discussion about them would not fit neatly into the cheerful choreography of a developer conference keynote. But they lingered in my mind as I watched Zuckerberg rally his audience. The company has brand-new marching orders that, according to the CEO, will require Facebook to reorganize itself. It will rip out old technical infrastructure and replace it with brand-new code bases. It will jettison its old gospel of public sharing and begin preaching privacy.</p><p>As it undertakes that very difficult work, the questions raised by Harari and others will linger. But as Zuckerberg works to fortify Facebook against future challengers, it's hard for me to imagine him giving it less than his all. And as Facebook transforms itself, how much attention will the company have left over to address all the social changes spinning out from inside it?</p><p>More from F8</p><p>What else happened at the first day of Facebook's developer conference? Facebook asked live stream viewers whether they think the company cares about them. Facebook Dating is coming to 14 more countries, and it's adding a  secret crush  feature. You can now ship stuff through Marketplace. The company's Spark AR platform has momentum.</p><p>The Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift S got mixed reviews, and you can now pre-order them. Portal is coming to more countries, and it's getting encrypted WhatsApp chats.</p><p>Instagram is redesigning its camera, adding a donations sticker, and letting influencers sell stuff via shoppable tags. (It's also testing a version that hides the amount of likes a post has, and some anti-bullying features.) WhatsApp is testing payments in India, and adding catalogs for businesses.</p><p>Lastly, I want to shout out the Facebook Band, an incredibly talented group of musicians who moonlight as Facebook employees at its London office. You will never play to a colder crowd than a group of developers and journalists at 8:30 a.m. in a convention hall in San Jose, and yet the Facebook Band's set had my row of journalists bouncing in our chairs for a full hour before the keynote. The one-two punch George Michael's  Freedom  90  with Rihanna's  We Found Love  was a particularly inspired combination, I thought. If you ever get a chance to see the Facebook Band play live, I highly recommend it.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>Tech Lobbyists Push to Defang California's Landmark Privacy Law</p><p>Issie Lapowsky reports that, as expected, lobbyists for big tech companies want to water down California's privacy law:</p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, gives residents of California the ability to request the data that businesses collect on them, demand that it be deleted, and opt out of having that data sold to third parties, among other things. But last week, the California Assembly's Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection advanced a series of bills that would either amend CCPA or carve out exemptions for certain categories of businesses. These bills received widespread backing from business groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce, as well as leading tech lobbying firms that represent the likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. But privacy groups almost unanimously opposed them, stoking fears that state lawmakers are about to strip the country's meatiest privacy law to the bone.</p><p>Poway Synagogue Shooting: America Under Attack by White Supremacists Acting Like ISIS</p><p>Kelly Weill examines the connection between online hate forum 8Chan and recent white nationalist terrorism:</p><p>After the New Zealand shooting, 8chan users decorated the alleged killer as a  saint  and encouraged each other to commit shootings of their own, including against synagogues, to prepare for the  third world war  against Jews, or to kill a journalist critical of the forum.</p><p> As a lot of people have noted over the past few days, 8chan is an awful cesspool of encouraging violence and hatred,  said Sam Jackson, an assistant professor focusing on online extremism at the University of Albany.  That hate and encouragement of violence might be a sort of baseline, background noise, but periodically someone moves from participating in this online awfulness to committing offline actions. </p><p>Christchurch-Style Terrorism Reaches American Shores</p><p>The Digital Forensic Research Lab examines the alleged shooter's online activity before and during this weekend's attack on the Poway Synagogue and finds that it is directly connected to last month's attack on two Christchurch mosques. It also asks why 8Chan deserves a platform on the web given how frequently terrorists use it to recruit followers:</p><p>In this overt championing of terrorist attacks, some 8chan boards are now essentially identical in content to the hidden Telegram channels used by ISIS militants. Both demonize their chosen targets, idolize extreme violence, and advocate and commemorate mass murder.</p><p>U.S. internet companies would not long tolerate a popular and public-facing website devoted to ISIS recruitment. It is surprising that they tolerate 8chan today. U.S. internet service providers would be well served to look to the example set by ISPs in Australia and New Zealand after the Christchurch attacks, which have blocked 8chan and its proxies. Cloudflare, the U.S. company that shields thousands of websites (including 8chan) from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks under its  content neutral  policy, might also reexamine its service commitment.</p><p>Facebook Frenzy: How the German Right Wing Dominates Social Media</p><p>Journalists at Spiegel analyzed German political parties' Facebook posts and found that the far-right party posted more   and reached more people on Facebook   than any other:</p><p>While political surveys indicate that support for the party is currently between 11 and 15 percent, fully 85 percent of all shared posts originating from German political parties stem from the AfD. The remaining 15 percent of these  shares  are split among the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the pro-environment Greens, the Left Party, the pro-business FDP and the conservatives. The countries big-tent parties   the SPD and the conservative combination of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU)   were only responsible for 2 to 3 percent of shares each.</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>YouTube CEO addresses top creator issues including copyright claims and trending section</p><p>In a new blog post, Susan Wojcicki told YouTubers that the service would attempt to ensure that at least half of all videos in its trending section are made by YouTube-native creators rather than celebrities and big publishers. Julia Alexander:</p><p>Creators have also complained that YouTube's trending section, an important page for finding viewers, often skips over their videos   instead showing sports highlights, movie trailers, music videos, and late-night clips. Those complaints are nothing new, but Wojcicki's blog marks the first time that an executive at YouTube has addressed those frustrations at length.</p><p>To address complaints, Wojcicki says at least half of all trending videos will now come from YouTubers,  with the remainder coming from music and traditional media.  That doesn't mean that a hugely popular video is guaranteed to appear on the trending list, but it addresses concerns that YouTube isn't prioritizing its own creators. Wojcicki says YouTube is  close  to hitting that representation figure already.</p><p>Google's YouTube to Stream Live Major League Baseball Games</p><p>Sure, why not:</p><p>Google's YouTube reached a deal with Major League Baseball for exclusive rights to stream games in the second half of the season, continuing the expansion of live sports to the internet.</p><p>K-pop Army Battle Royale</p><p> Billboard Music Awards' vote process is being manipulated by inauthentic Twitter accounts,  according to this analysis by Geoff Goldberg:</p><p>More than 20% of accounts that tweeted, retweeted, or were mentioned in tweets which include #FollowAnExoL are accounts that were created across three days (between April 18th, 2019 and April 20th, 2019, more specifically).</p><p>Launches</p><p>Twitter Expands Live-Streaming Video Lineup, Sets Content Deals With Viacom, ESPN, Live Nation, Univision, and More</p><p>Twitter is still doing video deals, Todd Spangler reports:</p><p>In addition to new initiatives with previous partners including the NFL, ESPN, Viacom, Major League Soccer, Live Nation, and Activision Blizzard, Twitter unveiled a deal with Univision Communications to bring more premium sports, news and entertainment content to the social network's U.S. Hispanic users.

Nothing else has emerged since. Not the date, not who arranged the menu, the venue, the seating, not the full guest list. And not whether some kind of deal got done between two of the most powerful men in the world. The news cycle moved on, and the dinner became one of the unsolved mysteries of American power.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I was able to pry some of those details loose last week from White House officials along with current and former senior Facebook employees and people they speak to. Most said they would only talk on the condition their names not be used, since the company is not eager to call attention to Zuckerberg's relationship with the president.  </p><p>Their accounts painted a picture of an unusual gathering - something in between a high-stakes state dinner between the leaders of uneasily allied superpowers and the awkward rehearsal dinner before a marriage that has both families a little rattled.  </p><p>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, pulled together the dinner on October 22 on short notice after he learned that Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, would be in Washington for a cryptocurrency hearing on Capitol Hill, a person familiar with the planning said.  </p><p>The dinner, the person said, took place in the Blue Room on the first floor of the White House. The guest list included Thiel, a Trump supporter, and his husband, Matt Danzeisen; Melania Trump; Kushner; and Ivanka Trump. The president, a person who has spoken to Zuckerberg said, did most of the talking. The atmosphere was convivial, another person said. Trump likes billionaires and likes people who are useful to him, and Zuckerberg right now is both.  </p><p>But looming over the private dinner is a question: Did Trump and Zuckerberg reach some kind of accommodation? Zuckerberg needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies.  </p><p>Trump needs access to Facebook's advertising platform and its viral power. Both men are getting what they want, and it's fair to wonder whether this is a mere alignment of interests or something more.  </p><p>\"I believe they have a deal,\" said Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor who is now a fierce critic, who added that it was \"probably implied rather than explicit\".  </p><p>\"Mark's deal with Trump is highly utilitarian,\" he said. \"It's basically about getting free rein and protection from regulation. Trump needs Facebook's thumb on the scale to win this election.\"  </p><p>Jesse Lehrich, the co-founder of Accountable Tech, a new nonprofit group pushing Facebook to tighten controls on its platform, suggested that the two men have a tacit nonaggression pact. \"Trump can rage at Big Tech and Mark can say he's disgusted by Trump's posts, but at the end of the day the status quo serves both of their interests,\" Lehrich said.  </p><p>Officials at Facebook and in the administration scoff at the notion that there is some kind of secret pact. And it's hard to imagine that anyone - certainly not Zuckerberg - would be dumb enough to make a secret deal with a president known for keeping neither secrets nor deals.  </p><p>Trump and Zuckerberg had met just once before the dinner, an Oval Office encounter last September. Afterward, the president boasted about his giant following on the platform. But October was a hot political month at Facebook: Zuckerberg was in an open battle with a leading Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was threatening to break up Facebook and whom he called \"an existential threat\" to the company. The morning of their dinner, a top British official demanded answers on why Facebook would tolerate false political advertising.  </p><p>Zuckerberg, a Facebook executive said, seems to view Trump as a peer. By contrast, he told amused top aides at one of his regular Monday meetings in March that Kushner was calling him so often about help with the administration's coronavirus response that he couldn't keep up, two people familiar with the meeting said. (\"Mark does not think of himself as a peer to this president or any president,\" a Facebook spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said, adding that Zuckerberg had initiated the conversation with Kushner about the coronavirus response.)  </p><p>Zuckerberg has played the high-stakes and unpredictable politics of the Trump years as well as any other corporate executive. And a week before the dinner last October, he made clear in a speech that his interests and the president's aligned: Zuckerberg would reject a growing movement to limit the false or inflammatory statements of the American president. \"I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\" he said in the address at Georgetown University on October 17. \"We don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\"  </p><p>Trump, for his part, has been notably softer on Facebook than on Amazon, Google, Twitter or Netflix at a moment when his regulatory apparatus often focuses on the political enemies he identifies in tweets.  </p><p>Still Facebook, like other tech giants, finds itself in a political bind: Democrats hate and distrust them because they spread right-wing misinformation and helped elect Donald Trump; Republicans hate and distrust them because they're run by California liberals and delete some right-wing speech. But Facebook has avoided that trap deftly over the last three and a half years, by moving faster and more earnestly than its competitors to mollify conservatives.  </p><p>Facebook has always had a keener ear to the right side of Washington than much of Silicon Valley, directed in part by Joel Kaplan, a Zuckerberg friend and former Bush administration official who is Facebook's vice president of global public policy. But it began focusing intently on winning over the conservative media in the spring of 2016, when Gizmodo alleged that the content moderation on the short-lived Trending Topics product on Facebook \"suppressed conservative news\". A right-wing apparatus that had spent decades claiming bias in the media turned its sights on the tech giant. And Zuckerberg gave them the response they'd always hoped for - he shut down the product, welcomed his critics to meetings and signalled that he shared their concerns.  </p><p>The next year, Trump continued to push the norms of truth and civility, and the social media platforms began reckoning with their broader misinformation and harassment problem. That set him on an inevitable - and to his supporters, welcome - collision course with the new gatekeepers. Trump's dependence on Facebook as an advertising vehicle - he spent US$44 million ($68m) on the platform in 2016, and is expected to far exceed that this year - means that he needs the company as much as it needs him.  </p><p>So Zuckerberg's warm relationship with the president and his family is a victory for the company's internal policy team led by Kaplan. But the company, people involved in its political strategy say, has been having an internal debate over balancing the reality of Republican control of regulatory agencies with the fact that Democrats are far more likely, in the long run, to actually push through new oversight or try to break up the company by forcing the sale of Instagram or WhatsApp. The balance, in the Trump years, has shifted right. Sheryl Sandberg, a leading Democrat and Zuckerberg's powerful deputy, has seen her connections with Democrats fray as the company defies them and her power in the company fades as well.  </p><p>Trump's administration has reciprocated. The Justice Department is currently conducting antitrust investigations of the tech giants. But while Google and Amazon face \"mature investigations\", the Facebook inquiry is \"not real at all\", a person who has been briefed on the investigation said. And Facebook has acted like a company with no worries in Washington. It has continued to acquire companies, and moved to allow users to send messages between Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - a merging of the services that could further fuel monopoly concerns. (Facebook's view is that it's far less dominant than the other big tech companies and has less to worry about than Google or Amazon.)  </p><p>The summer of 2020 is one of those moments when corporate Washington starts to panic. What had looked like deft Trump-era politics now looks like exposure and risk.  </p><p>Top Democrats, including Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi - who was infuriated when a distorted video of her went viral - have singled out Facebook as a bad actor. Trump is, at the moment, viewed by Washington's insider class as likely to lose in November, though Biden poses less of a threat to Facebook than Warren would have.  </p><p>While executives across Facebook insist that Zuckerberg's position on free speech on the platform is a matter of long-term planning and principle, not political expediency, his political team also recognises that they are badly out of position for a Democratic administration. And in recent days, Facebook has been eager to show its independence from the White House. The company has been unhesitatingly enforcing existing policy against Trump's posts, and has been quick to point it out to the media, as it did last Thursday, when a Trump ad used a symbol associated with Nazi Germany.  </p><p>Zuckerberg has not budged, however, on his core insistence that Trump should be able to say what he wants on the platform, and most of what he wants in ads - including false statements, as long as they aren't misleading on specific, narrow topics, like the census. But he did reportedly tell Trump that he objected, personally, to Trump's warning that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\". And he and Chan wrote to scientists funded by their nonprofit organisation that they were \"deeply shaken and disgusted by President Trump's divisive and incendiary rhetoric\".  </p><p>Those gestures may have appeased Facebook's workforce, but they've gone largely unnoticed in Washington.  </p><p>\"All the big companies tacked to the right after Trump won, and Facebook probably moved farther than the others,\" said Nu Wexler, a Democrat who worked in policy communications for Facebook in Washington. \"But the politics of tech are changing, and companies should be worried about Democrats as well.  </p><p>\"The days of just keeping the president happy are over.\"New York Times      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHwehtrumpfacebook</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6072-KM01-F12B-J19X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 27, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Magerman lost his millions-a-year job at Mercer's giant hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, after warning that Mercer insisted that Donald Trump use Cambridge Analytica \"to get unpopular initiatives (like electing Donald Trump) through the electorate.\"</p><p>What's next? Investor lawsuits are piling up. \"What has happened to Facebook bears strong resemblance to the Equifax data breach, the inappropriate actions at Wells Fargo, the explosion of the rig in the Gulf of Mexico operated by British Petroleum, the accelerator controversy at Toyota, and the false [diesel-emissions] claims at Volkswagen,\" writes Jim Meyer, chief investment officer at the $1 billion-asset Tower Bridge Investments, West Conshohocken, in a note to clients of Boenning &amp; Scattergood.</p><p>\"In each of these episodes, the company in question may or may not have broken laws, but in all cases, there were clear lapses in oversight at a minimum,\" Meyer writes. \"... Each of these incidents is reputation damaging, but in the long run, companies can and usually do regain trust. Very few of us are staying away from Toyota because an accelerator may or may not stick inadvertently, and we are more than happy to buy gas at a BP station if the price is right.\"</p><p>Similarly there are no early signs of users mass-abandoning Facebook.</p><p>But Facebook will likely face pain -- \"enhanced government scrutiny\" and forced changes in its business practices, Meyer adds.</p><p>Already Facebook has \"lost control of the story,\" he says. \"... The worst, from an image standpoint, will occur on the day that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg sit down before Congress and get lambasted 15 minutes at a time by senators and congressmen who get their moment in the limelight to demonstrate their outrage.\"</p><p>Unlike ex-Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, who was forced out and made to return a fraction of his multimillion-dollar pay package over his bank's unauthorized, phony accounts, Zuckerberg controls Facebook's voting stock and will likely keep his job.</p><p>Meyer is skeptical that Facebook boycotts will amount to much: \"Facebook isn't going away. It is too entrenched in too many people's lives.\" If you gave Facebook your birthday and your children's names, that information is already being exploited, and young people no longer expect that stuff to be private.</p><p>But \"that doesn't mean Facebook is home free. Quite the contrary,\" Meyer says in his note. \"If Facebook was lax in allowing Cambridge Analytica to use and retain its data improperly and contrary to a consent decree it signed with the FTC [in 2011],\" it's in for heavy-duty government scrutiny.</p><p>Unlike the news stories posted by this newspaper, Facebook and other social-media companies don't control their content, Meyer adds. \"They can, however, police their sites and remove harmful posts, and they can close accounts that abuse their agreement to use the media site properly.\"</p><p>Social-media and search giants such  as Facebook and Google can't be trusted to police themselves, as Gabriel Weinberg of Paoli-based DuckDuckGo keeps reminding us. Facebook made user data available to firms such as Cambridge Analytica as a \"business model,\" Weinberg tweeted Sunday. \"This should be the nail in the coffin for privacy self-regulation by Big Tech,\" he added. \"It doesn't work.\"</p><p>\"That's where government comes in. It is a bit like car safety,\" with government ordering seat belts and pollution controls, Meyer adds.</p><p>Will Facebook shares recover? The company \"is clearly tarnished,\" Meyer says. But Zuckerberg has faced pushback before, and \"all big tech companies go through this phase,\" he concluded.</p><p>Still, Facebook will need new ways to grow sales if it is to continue justifying its sky-high share price. Indeed, Facebook, along with Google, has lost a significant part of the \"duopoly's\" once-dominant market share, as Amazon and Snapchat gain, notes veteran digital-media observer Terry Chabrowe at eMarketer.com</p><p>Monica Peart, senior forecaster at eMarketer, estimates that Google/YouTube and Facebook/Instagram will gain just under half of new digital ad spending in 2018, down from more than 70 percent in 2016. Indeed, Facebook is no longer gaining market share, though Instagram is still picking up advertisers faster than the internet as a whole.</p><p>___ (c)2018 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20180321-PHI-Facebook-stumbles-amid-campaign-data-scandal-but-don-t-count-it-out-0321-20180321PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-G9Y1-DYNS-30TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

Photograph: Johanna Geron/Reuters</p><p>Australia s information commissioner is suing Facebook over allegedly breaching the privacy of over 300,000 Australians caught up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In a case lodged in the federal court on Monday, the Australian information commissioner Angelene Falk has alleged Facebook committed serious and repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law because data collected by Facebook was passed onto the This is Your Digital Life app by Cambridge Analytica for political profiling, which was not what it was collected for.</p><p>Data included people s names, dates of birth, email addresses, city location, friends list, page likes and Facebook messages for those who had granted the app access to the messages.</p><p> We consider the design of the Facebook platform meant that users were unable to exercise reasonable choice and control about how their personal information was disclosed,  Falk said.</p><p> Facebook s default settings facilitated the disclosure of personal information, including sensitive information, at the expense of privacy. </p><p>At the time, Facebook said 311,127 Australians between March 2014 and May 2015 had data shared with the app, accounting for 0.4% of users affected by the breach.</p><p>However, the court documents reveal just 53 people in Australia installed the app.</p><h>Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate   sent direct to you</h><p>The OAIC says in its court filing that the design of Facebook made it so that users were unable to consent or control over how their data was disclosed, and to date, Facebook has not been able to tell the OAIC which Australian users were affected.</p><p>The Guardian and Observer revealed data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica worked with Donald Trump s election team and the Leave campaign in the UK Brexit referendum.</p><p>The data was used to build a software program to predict and influence voters. Facebook discovered the information had been harvested by a third party in late 2015, but failed to alert users at the time.</p><p>In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company had been engaging with the OAIC on this matter for two years.</p><p> We ve made major changes to our platforms, in consultation with international regulators, to restrict the information available to app developers, implement new governance protocols and build industry-leading controls to help people protect and manage their data,  she said.</p><p> We re unable to comment further as this is now before the federal court. </p><p>Each contravention comes with a maximum penalty of $1.7m. The OAIC is alleging multiple breaches but did not indicate whether penalties would be sought for all 311,127 users affected.</p><p>The relief sought just asks the court to order Facebook to  pay civil pecuniary penalties  under the Privacy Act  as applicable for contraventions that occurred during the relevant period. </p><p>According to the court documents, Cambridge Analytica provided written confirmation in January 2016 that all users  personal information obtained through the app had been deleted, but the company did not take any independent steps to ensure the data had been deleted or destroyed.</p><p>In the UK Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 for the breach, while in the US, the federal trade commission fined the company US$5bn. In October last year, the OAIC was criticised for taking its time in resolving the investigation.</p><h>Since you re here </h><p>... we have a small favour to ask. More people, like you, are reading and supporting the Guardian s independent, investigative journalism than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we made the choice to keep our reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.</p><p>The Guardian will engage with the most critical issues of our time   from the escalating climate catastrophe to widespread inequality to the influence of big tech on our lives. At a time when factual information is a necessity, we believe that each of us, around the world, deserves access to accurate reporting with integrity at its heart.</p><p>Our editorial independence means we set our own agenda and voice our own opinions. Guardian journalism is free from commercial and political bias and not influenced by billionaire owners or shareholders. This means we can give a voice to those less heard, explore where others turn away, and rigorously challenge those in power.</p><p>We hope you will consider supporting us today. We need your support to keep delivering quality journalism that s open and independent. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support The Guardian from as little as \u00a31   and it only takes a minute.

Lewis claims that the social media site has displayed at least 50 adverts purporting to be endorsed by him but which, in fact, did not have his seal of approval. Worse still, many of the ads reportedly link to articles that carry misleading information, thus causing Lewis reputational damage, he claims. </p><p>'Today (Monday 23 April), I will issue High Court proceedings against Facebook, to try and stop all the disgusting repeated fake adverts from scammers it refuses to stop publishing with my picture, name and reputation,' Lewis said in a blog post. Lewis will be seeking exemplary damages from Facebook but said that any money he receives from the case will go to charities serving those who have been scammed by 'get rich quick' con artists. The Advertising Standards Authority has previously upheld Lewis's assertion that the adverts in question made it appear as if he had endorsed the advertised services. 'The most prevalent are get-rich-quick schemes currently titled 'Bitcoin code' or 'Cloud Trader', which are fronts for binary trading firms based outside the EU. Binary trading is a financially dangerous, near-certain money-loser, which the regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) strongly warns against,' Lewis's blog post revealed. \"It's affecting my reputation but more importantly it is affecting real people who are handing over money in good faith while the scammers are raking in the cash,\" said Lewis. 'Other companies such as Outbrain who have run these adverts have taken them down. What is particularly pernicious about Facebook is that it says the onus is on me, so I have spent time and effort and stress repeatedly to have them taken down,' Lewis was quoted by The Guardian newspaper as saying. Mark Lewis of Seddons, the legal firm that is handling the case for Lewis, said: 'Facebook is not above the law - it cannot hide outside the UK and think that it is untouchable. Exemplary damages are being sought. This means we will ask the court to ensure they are substantial enough that Facebook can't simply see paying out damages as just the 'cost of business' and carry on regardless. It needs to be shown that the price of causing misery is very high.' A spokesperson for Facebook told technology website TechCrunch that it does not allow adverts that are misleading or false and, as indicated by Lewis in his blog post, the spokesperson said the onus was on Lewis to report any adverts that infringe his rights so they can be removed. Lewis's view is that Facebook has been told he does not 'do adverts' and that, therefore, any ad with his picture or name in it is without his permission. 'I've asked it not to publish them, or at least to check their legitimacy with me before publishing. This shouldn't be difficult - after all, it's a leader in face and text recognition. Yet it simply continues to repeatedly publish these adverts and then relies on me to report them, once the damage has been done. 'Even when they are reported, many have been left up for days or weeks, and finally, when they are taken down the scammers just launch a new, nearly identical campaign very soon afterwards and the whole rigmarole starts again,' Lewis claimed. Natasha Lomas, a senior report for TechCrunch, confirmed that Facebook's ad guidelines do prohibit advertisements that contain 'deceptive, false, or misleading content, including deceptive claims, offers, or business practices' and they also specifically prohibit cryptocurrency-related ads. 'As is increasingly evident where big tech platforms are concerned, meaningful enforcement of existing policies is what's sorely lacking,' she wrote. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PAIN1135371524489385362251765300180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PAIN-113537</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5J-FFC1-JCMN-Y0SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>1:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Proactive Investors</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You're watching CNN. I'm Brooke Baldwin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The war against ISIS is over. That is according to President Trump, who is planning a full and rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a tweet just this morning, the president and commander in chief declared: \"We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this move affects some 2,000 troops in Syria who have been training local forces to fight the terrorist group. And while the president may be declaring victory, some of his fellow Republicans are saying the exact opposite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN has learned that Vice President Mike Pence has gotten an earful as this closed-door lunch that's just been going on.</p><p>In front of the cameras, you have Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: When Obama withdrew from Iraq, he did so again against military advice. We made a clear record of what that advice was, and the consequences of General Obama's decision.</p><p>We need to do the same thing for the Trump administration. It's my belief that this was made against sound military advice. But let's establish a record. And I don't think General Trump is going to be any better than General Obama.</p><p>I have not found one person, national security-wise, who believes it's a good idea to remove the 2,200 troops, which was a small footprint, that was a bulwark against Iran expansion and insurance policy against the rise of ISIS.</p><p>Maybe he proves to be right. I don't think he will be any more right than Obama was. And I know this. If Obama had made this decision, Republicans would be all over him. QUESTION: How did the vice president take that criticism?</p><p>GRAHAM: He was very respectful. I think the vice president sees the world in many ways like I do. He's loyal to the president.</p><p>The president made campaign promises. I don't think anybody ever -- I don't remember hearing, I will withdraw from Syria if I need to stay there to defeat ISIS. I heard we will defeat ISIS.</p><p>People always celebrate when troops come home. That's a good thing. But you can't celebrate false security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN: Let's discuss.</p><p>I have with me CNN military analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. He is former U.S. Army commanding general Europe and the 7th Army. And CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who has done extensive reporting on the war in Syria, who's in Washington for us today.</p><p>So, great to have both of you all on.</p><p>And, General, if I may just begin with you. Just two weeks ago, the chairman of Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, said this about what it would take to defeat ISIS in Syria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN: I will give you some idea of the order magnitude of the work to be done. We estimate, for example, about 35,000 to 40,000 local forces have to be trained and equipped in order to provide stability.</p><p>We're probably somewhere along the line of 20 percent through the training of those forces. With regard to stabilization, we still have a long way to go. And so I would be reluctant to affix a time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN: So, General Hertling, do you even think that top military brass is on board with this? Do you even think our American forces over there had any clue this would be happening?</p><p>LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't believe they did, Brooke, and it's because I have talked to several of them this morning, several of my friends who are in the area and have been conducting operations there.</p><p>This was quite a unilateral announcement by the president this morning. I think it caught many people off-guard. You just quoted General Dunford. I think General Mattis -- or -- I'm sorry -- Secretary Mattis was also surprised by this, as well as General Votel in Central Command, General Thomas in Special Operations Command, as well as all of our allies. So this is more than just a wake-up-and-tweet moment. This is really affecting not only our strategy in the region, which is not that strong in the first place, but it certainly contributes to the strategies of others successfully being accomplished, like Russia, around Turkey and the Syrian government.</p><p>So, yes, this was a surprise. And I think it's unfortunate, because, as Senator Graham also pointed out, the key principals in the U.S. government didn't know about this. You could quote General Dunford, but Brett McGurk, who's the envoy to the region, was just talking about how we needed to have forces there for several years just two days ago.</p><p>BALDWIN: How do you think, Arwa -- that's U.S. military responding.</p><p>[15:05:00]</p><p>We're hearing U.S. allies in the region were blindsided, that this was a total surprise. How do you think this is playing out in the region there?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think the key players in the region certainly are still reeling from this and trying to see exactly how that's going to affect them individually, but also how it's going to play into the broader Syrian battlefield.</p><p>By removing the U.S. presence there, you do remove a force that was to a certain degree of buffer against Iranian influence, a buffer against Russian influence, but also one that was actively preventing ISIS by backing these forces on the ground from moving into the security vacuums that had been created.</p><p>And let's not forget that there still is fairly heavy and intense fighting happening in some small pockets. Even though they are small, it is still significant, such as along the Euphrates River Valley along the border with Iraq.</p><p>And then, of course, you have the issue of history and the risk of history repeating itself. This most certainly would not be the first time that the U.S. has had declared an ISIS-like entity -- remember, before, they were the Islamic State of Iraq. Before that, we had al Qaeda in Iraq.</p><p>All of them had been declared defeated, and all of them managed to reemerge and come back even stronger than before.</p><p>BALDWIN: So to hear the president say defeated, I hear you on learning the lessons of history and how dangerous that may or may not be.</p><p>Also part of this, General, to you on the role of Turkey, really, to General Hertling and then Arwa as well -- Turkey, the Syrian neighbor to the north, there's some speculation around the timing of the president's decision because he was just on the phone this week with the leader of Turkey, President Erdogan.</p><p>What do we know about that call, General -- or, General, to you first -- and might even be a factor?</p><p>HERTLING: I'm certain it was a factor, Brooke.</p><p>The president has proven himself to be a transactional leader. He looks for short-term wins. He more than likely got it in his call to President Erdogan. What it connected to, you could probably name a series of things. Could be information regarding the death of Khashoggi?</p><p>Could it be the fact that, on Sunday and then again yesterday, there was an announcement made that we had just made inroads in selling $3.5 billion worth of air defense equipment in a Patriot missile package to Turkey? Could that be a part of it?</p><p>He seems to be very enlightened and happy about the fact any time we can make arm sales to another government. And other governments will quickly say, hey, we will buy this equipment if you do this or that. And I'm sure that was part of the negotiation with Turkey, because governments around the world know how to get to our president.</p><p>It's all about the transactional agreement, not the transformational approach of, how do you make organizations better, how do you go for the long term?</p><p>BALDWIN: So, what does this even look like, Arwa? Is this a get those forces out, like, flip a switch? Are some remaining to train local forces? What does this even look like in some 100 days?</p><p>DAMON: I mean, we don't really know. What it sounds like is flip a switch, although, of course, anyone who's ever dealt with the military and the military itself will tell you that you don't just flip a switch and withdraw your forces.</p><p>No matter what orders come down, there is a process and procedure to all of this. What sort of future training mission there may be, we don't really know. What's going to happen to all of the air assets that the U.S. is providing for the forces that it does back in Syria? That, we don't know.</p><p>On the issue of Turkey, another key sticking point for Turkey, of course, was America's backing for the Syrian Kurds, which Turkey views as being part of the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group that Turkey views as being a terrorist organization that it has been fighting for decades.</p><p>Turkey certainly did want to see the U.S. withdraw some of their support for those Kurds, withdraw from locations and force the Kurds to withdraw from locations that Turkey had been threatening to push into, such as Manbij.</p><p>Whether or not Turkey would have gone so far as to push the U.S. to withdraw completely, that seems like very risky demand for the Turks to have made, given that if there is any sort of vacuum, that vacuum also directly affects their border.</p><p>So unless they have a plan in place to continue to secure these areas, it would potentially be vulnerable for a reemergence of ISIS or for new battle lines to unfold. We really don't know.</p><p>I mean, Syria just gets messier every single time we talk about it. And, of course, it all comes at the expense of the civilian population.</p><p>HERTLING: You know, Brooke, if I can add too, we're talking -- Arwa is rightfully talking about what will happen to the Kurds. They have just conducted an operation in a place called Hajin.</p><p>We have trainers in a place in Southern Syria called al (INAUDIBLE) that the Russians have asked us to get out of. Here's the other interesting piece. We are not only doing these kind of operations, but we're also leading many allied nations in this part of the world.</p><p>There are allied special operations working with us. To wake up and find out that the president hasn't addressed our members of Congress in terms of this action, you can bet he hasn't addressed the national leaders of some of the allied nations that we're dealing with in this area, too.</p><p>[15:10:04]</p><p>So again, it's just -- it's throwing more chaos into an already very complex situation.</p><p>BALDWIN: Got it. General, thank you very much. And, Arwa, thank you.</p><p>Now to our breaking financial news. Excuse me. The financial -- the Federal Reserve ignored President Trump's repeated requests and went ahead and raised a key interest rate. So, moments ago, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, Trump -- excuse me -- I blame it on the end of the year. I don't know. We're all getting sick.</p><p>Jay Powell, a Trump appointee, was asked about the pressure coming from the president. Here is how he responded:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN NOMINEE: Political considerations have -- play no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy. We're always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us.</p><p>We have the tools to carry it about. We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way. And we are -- we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN: And we're going to talk about it after a break.</p><p>[15:15:39]</p><p>BALDWIN: Welcome back.</p><p>All right, so before the break, we were talking about the Fed raising interest rates for the fourth time this year.</p><p>So I have with me \"Washington Post\" columnist and CNN political commentator Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Welcome to you.</p><p>So, we now know that they're going to raise the rates 2.5 percent. The markets, they have been going back and forth, now down about 300 points right now reacting to this.</p><p>What does this mean for the economy? What does this mean for people with credit card debt, that kind of thing?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Sure.</p><p>So this was widely expected that they were going to raise rates today. They had signaled it for a very long time, despite the fact that Trump clearly very vocally did not want them to. So I think this is not a surprise.</p><p>What was a little more interesting, what we didn't know as much about was what the Fed says is going to happen next year. And they actually downgraded their expectations for growth next year. They said, growth is going to be a little bit slower than they had said, that they had forecast a couple of months ago.</p><p>And, accordingly, they also said that they're probably not going to raise rates as much next year. So I guess Trump may be happy about that, although the reason behind the fewer expected rate hikes has to do with the fact that the economy may have more weakness in it.</p><p>And we have seen some signs of that from the stock market, right? The stock market has been sort of whipsawing back and forth. The stock market is not the economy, so I want to be clear about that. But it does give us some -- you know, some tea leaves to read, at the very least, about...</p><p>BALDWIN: What are you reading?</p><p>RAMPELL: So, for example, the things that the market has been freaked out about have to do with the trade war, the trade war with China, I should say trade wars, plural, since we have them on multiple fronts at this point.</p><p>And if you look at what economists are worried about, it is also the trade war with China. There was this recent \"Wall Street Journal\" survey in which about half of economists who were surveyed said that the single biggest threat to the U.S. economy next year was, in fact, the U.S.-China trade war, especially, of course, if tariffs go up more. That very same survey also found that a majority of economists were expecting a recession by 2020. So that's one example. There are other things going on. There's been some weakness in the housing market. The health care sector has also been sort of dealing with this great uncertainty as a result of Obamacare potentially being struck down.</p><p>BALDWIN: Sure. Sure.</p><p>RAMPELL: So, there are number of risks that are out there in the economy that we should be certainly keeping an eye on.</p><p>This expansion is now about to become the longest expansion on record, so, statistically speaking, like, we are sort of overdue for a recession. But at the moment, the Fed just says growth is slowing. They're not forecasting...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALDWIN: Here's what we have specifically, just to put a button on what you're saying.</p><p>RAMPELL: Yes.</p><p>BALDWIN: Jerome Powell says, political considerations have -- quote -- \"played no role,\" a la, the president inserting himself and tweeting about this and the Fed's decisions -- quote -- \"Nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do.\"</p><p>So, Catherine Rampell, thank you.</p><p>RAMPELL: Thank you.</p><p>BALDWIN: Lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, they are racing to try and prevent a partial government shutdown on Friday. But a short-term spending bill to keep the government running could dash President Trump's hopes of money for a border wall.</p><p>Just over a week ago, the president was refusing to budge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am proud to shut down the government for border security.</p><p>I will take the mantle. I will be the to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN: But this is what White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway just said this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: This is all breaking news, in other words, what the Congress is going to put before him, a short- term C.R. a C.R. that goes through to February 8, keeps the government up and running.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the president is backing down from a central promise, not a campaign promise, a promise as president of the United States and our commander in chief, to keep us safe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN: CNN correspondent Ryan Nobles is following the developments for us on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And so, as far as the C.R. is concerned, the short-term spending bill, what's the likelihood that happens?</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brooke, I think we are as reasonably confident as you can be before a vote is cast that they're going to avert the shutdown in some way, shape or form.</p><p>Senate leaders said just a few minutes ago that they plan on voting on this continuing resolution sometime this afternoon. Leaders on the House side have expressed support for it as well.</p><p>And even Vice President Pence told Senate leaders in a closed-door luncheon about an hour ago that the president would sign this clean C.R. to keep the government open until February 8.</p><p>[15:20:03]</p><p>So, we think it's going to get done, Brooke, but you never know until the votes are cast. But it's important to point out, as you clearly stated, this doesn't include a lot of these things that the president was hoping for a win.</p><p>At one point, it appeared as though he was going to use this for leverage to get funding for that border wall. That doesn't appear to be part of the game plan for President Trump right now. They seem not willing at least to go to that point to shut down a significant portion of the government in exchange for getting that funding, at least not at this point -- Brooke.</p><p>BALDWIN: So if they go with the C.R., that means they would take it back up at the top of the year. That would then be when the Democrats are majority in the House. What then would that mean for his big border wall?</p><p>NOBLES: Well, there's no doubt that this process becomes increasingly more difficult for President Trump once Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House and the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.</p><p>But you already see how the White House is pivoting to a certain degree when it comes to funding for the border wall. And it seems more and more likely that if they find this funding, it won't come in some form of direct congressional authorization.</p><p>In other words, the White House is going to try and get creative with their budgeting tactics and try and find that money elsewhere. Could it come in the form of a line item in a budget that is just for broad border security, and then the Department of Homeland Security uses that to pay for a border wall?</p><p>Or do they find money from other departments, ask Cabinet secretaries to find funding in their budgets that is to some degree fungible and turn that into funding for the border wall? That's difficult, Brooke. That's not an easy process.</p><p>But that seems to be one of the only few options that this White House has left if President Trump's going to make good on this promise to his supporters to build a physical wall along the southern border.</p><p>BALDWIN: Got it. Ryan, thank you very much on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Coming up next: Facebook is now facing a lawsuit from the D.C. attorney general for sharing your information with third parties. We have details on that and the new report that Facebook was also sharing users' private messages with other tech companies.</p><p>Hear how they're responding.</p><p>[15:26:41]</p><p>BALDWIN: More fallout from Facebook today.</p><p>The D.C. attorney general has just filed a lawsuit against them over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The lawsuit alleges Facebook failed to protect users' data during the 2016 election and allowed third-party applications to manipulate -- to manipulate it -- easy for me to say -- for its political purposes.</p><p>So, this all comes on the heels of a searing \"New York Times\" report that reveals Facebook offered big tech companies your personal information without asking you first. Internal Facebook documents obtained by \"The Times\" revealed, in some cases, your private messages were shared.</p><p>CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter is with me now.</p><p>So, starting with \"The Times\"' reporting, what exactly was shared and how is Facebook responding to this?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was kind of like a secret front door that was there.</p><p>Facebook propped it open for years, allowing all these technology companies, as you mentioned, Spotify and Netflix and Microsoft and Amazon and others, to peer through that front door if they wanted. Now, a lot of these companies -- you see them on screen here -- they say, hey, we didn't actually use this feature. Netflix says, we weren't looking at your private messages.</p><p>But the point is that Facebook enabled that access, allowed it as a possibility. And that is creepy. For all these tech companies, sometimes, it's about passing the creepy test. Does that seem creepy? Well, yes, it obviously seems creepy to be able to access private messages of users, when you're not even at Facebook, if you're at some other company.</p><p>So what does Facebook say? They say this was a part of a partner program. All of our partners made Facebook better. They made the Web better by making it more feature -- more user-friendly.</p><p>But I think this is another example of Facebook's worst year ever, a year full of privacy scandals and revelations about how, in some cases, users are not just helped out, they're abused by these technologies and tools.</p><p>Here's a part of the company's statement acknowledging they need to improve in some ways.</p><p>They say, look, companies, partners, they \"don't get to ignore people's privacy settings. But we have got work to do to regain people's trust.\" They say: \"Partnerships are an area of focus this year. And, as we have said, we are winding down that integration partnership that was built to help people across Facebook.\"</p><p>So, in other words, they say that front door, the front door is closed now. But I think there's this broader issue, Brooke, about what else is Facebook doing that we might not even know about? It's a black box.</p><p>BALDWIN: They say the front door is closed. What can people do who are -- have all their Facebook accounts and rely on Facebook? What can they do to protect themselves?</p><p>STELTER: Other than deleting Facebook, which I know some people say they're doing, but is maybe unrealistic for a lot of folks watching, you can do a privacy checkup, you can log on to Facebook or Instagram or WhatsApp. They own all of them.</p><p>Do a checkup, make sure that you don't -- you haven't left any lights on by accident, left any doors open by accident. But the reality is, I think people are largely at the whims of these giant technology companies.</p><p>And that's why this attorney general suit in D.C. today is interesting. Washington, kind of in general, regulators in general, they have been asleep about this for several years, but they are waking up now.</p><p>A number of Democratic lawmakers spoke out against -- when \"The New York Times\" story came out last night, a number of Democratic congressman said, this is really troubling. We need to do more. So there's definitely a sense of regulation in the air, a sense of possible oversight in the air, because, frankly, Brooke, \"The New York Times\" is not enough in terms of oversight. CNN is not enough in terms of oversight. We actually need to see the government ensure people's privacy, in the same way they do in lots of other industries.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALDWIN: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: And technology can't be -- can't be the exception to the rule.</p><p>BALDWIN: Yes.</p><p>Brian Stelter, thank you very much for that.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>BALDWIN: Next: A former Green Beret who admitted to killing a suspected Taliban bomb-maker is now charged with murder and facing death.</p><p>President Trump says he may intervene in the case.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018121907CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0V-W1Y1-JB20-G40X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You're watching CNN.  I'm Brooke Baldwin.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The war against ISIS is over.  That is according to President Trump, who is planning a full and rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a tweet just this morning, the president and commander in chief declared: \"We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this move affects some 2,000 troops in Syria who have been training local forces to fight the terrorist group.  And while the president may be declaring victory, some of his fellow Republicans are saying the exact opposite.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN has learned that Vice President Mike Pence has gotten an earful as this closed-door lunch that's just been going on.</p><p>In front of the cameras, you have Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  When Obama withdrew from Iraq, he did so again against military advice.  We made a clear record of what that advice was, and the consequences of General Obama's decision.</p><p>We need to do the same thing for the Trump administration.  It's my belief that this was made against sound military advice.  But let's establish a record.  And I don't think General Trump is going to be any better than General Obama.  </p><p>I have not found one person, national security-wise, who believes it's a good idea to remove the 2,200 troops, which was a small footprint, that was a bulwark against Iran expansion and insurance policy against the rise of ISIS.</p><p>Maybe he proves to be right.  I don't think he will be any more right than Obama was.  And I know this.  If Obama had made this decision, Republicans would be all over him. QUESTION:  How did the vice president take that criticism?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  He was very respectful.  I think the vice president sees the world in many ways like I do.  He's loyal to the president.</p><p>The president made campaign promises.  I don't think anybody ever -- I don't remember hearing, I will withdraw from Syria if I need to stay there to defeat ISIS.  I heard we will defeat ISIS.</p><p>People always celebrate when troops come home.  That's a good thing. But you can't celebrate false security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BALDWIN:  Let's discuss.</p><p>I have with me CNN military analyst retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.  He is former U.S. Army commanding general Europe and the 7th Army.  And CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who has done extensive reporting on the war in Syria, who's in Washington for us today.  </p><p>So, great to have both of you all on.  </p><p>And, General, if I may just begin with you.  Just two weeks ago, the chairman of Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, said this about what it would take to defeat ISIS in Syria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN:  I will give you some idea of the order magnitude of the work to be done.  We estimate, for example, about 35,000 to 40,000 local forces have to be trained and equipped in order to provide stability.  </p><p>We're probably somewhere along the line of 20 percent through the training of those forces.  With regard to stabilization, we still have a long way to go.  And so I would be reluctant to affix a time.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN:  So, General Hertling, do you even think that top military brass is on board with this?  Do you even think our American forces over there had any clue this would be happening?  </p><p>LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  I don't believe they did, Brooke, and it's because I have talked to several of them this morning, several of my friends who are in the area and have been conducting operations there.  </p><p>This was quite a unilateral announcement by the president this morning.  I think it caught many people off-guard.  You just quoted General Dunford.  I think General Mattis -- or -- I'm sorry -- Secretary Mattis was also surprised by this, as well as General Votel in Central Command, General Thomas in Special Operations Command, as well as all of our allies.   So this is more than just a wake-up-and-tweet moment.  This is really affecting not only our strategy in the region, which is not that strong in the first place, but it certainly contributes to the strategies of others successfully being accomplished, like Russia, around Turkey and the Syrian government.  </p><p>So, yes, this was a surprise.  And I think it's unfortunate, because, as Senator Graham also pointed out, the key principals in the U.S. government didn't know about this.  You could quote General Dunford, but Brett McGurk, who's the envoy to the region, was just talking about how we needed to have forces there for several years just two days ago.</p><p>BALDWIN:  How do you think, Arwa -- that's U.S. military responding.</p><p>[15:05:00]</p><p>We're hearing U.S. allies in the region were blindsided, that this was a total surprise.  How do you think this is playing out in the region there?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I think the key players in the region certainly are still reeling from this and trying to see exactly how that's going to affect them individually, but also how it's going to play into the broader Syrian battlefield.</p><p>By removing the U.S. presence there, you do remove a force that was to a certain degree of buffer against Iranian influence, a buffer against Russian influence, but also one that was actively preventing ISIS by backing these forces on the ground from moving into the security vacuums that had been created.  </p><p>And let's not forget that there still is fairly heavy and intense fighting happening in some small pockets.  Even though they are small, it is still significant, such as along the Euphrates River Valley along the border with Iraq.  </p><p>And then, of course, you have the issue of history and the risk of history repeating itself.  This most certainly would not be the first time that the U.S. has had declared an ISIS-like entity -- remember, before, they were the Islamic State of Iraq.  Before that, we had al Qaeda in Iraq.</p><p>All of them had been declared defeated, and all of them managed to reemerge and come back even stronger than before.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  So to hear the president say defeated, I hear you on learning the lessons of history and how dangerous that may or may not be.</p><p>Also part of this, General, to you on the role of Turkey, really, to General Hertling and then Arwa as well -- Turkey, the Syrian neighbor to the north, there's some speculation around the timing of the president's decision because he was just on the phone this week with the leader of Turkey, President Erdogan.  </p><p>What do we know about that call, General -- or, General, to you first -- and might even be a factor?</p><p>HERTLING:  I'm certain it was a factor, Brooke.  </p><p>The president has proven himself to be a transactional leader.  He looks for short-term wins.  He more than likely got it in his call to President Erdogan.  What it connected to, you could probably name a series of things.  Could be information regarding the death of Khashoggi?  </p><p>Could it be the fact that, on Sunday and then again yesterday, there was an announcement made that we had just made inroads in selling $3.5 billion worth of air defense equipment in a Patriot missile package to Turkey?  Could that be a part of it?  </p><p>He seems to be very enlightened and happy about the fact any time we can make arm sales to another government.  And other governments will quickly say, hey, we will buy this equipment if you do this or that. And I'm sure that was part of the negotiation with Turkey, because governments around the world know how to get to our president.</p><p>It's all about the transactional agreement, not the transformational approach of, how do you make organizations better, how do you go for the long term?</p><p>BALDWIN:  So, what does this even look like, Arwa?  Is this a get those forces out, like, flip a switch?  Are some remaining to train local forces?  What does this even look like in some 100 days?  </p><p>DAMON:  I mean, we don't really know.  What it sounds like is flip a switch, although, of course, anyone who's ever dealt with the military and the military itself will tell you that you don't just flip a switch and withdraw your forces.</p><p>No matter what orders come down, there is a process and procedure to all of this.  What sort of future training mission there may be, we don't really know.  What's going to happen to all of the air assets that the U.S. is providing for the forces that it does back in Syria? That, we don't know.</p><p>On the issue of Turkey, another key sticking point for Turkey, of course, was America's backing for the Syrian Kurds, which Turkey views as being part of the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group that Turkey views as being a terrorist organization that it has been fighting for decades.</p><p>Turkey certainly did want to see the U.S. withdraw some of their support for those Kurds, withdraw from locations and force the Kurds to withdraw from locations that Turkey had been threatening to push into, such as Manbij.</p><p>Whether or not Turkey would have gone so far as to push the U.S. to withdraw completely, that seems like very risky demand for the Turks to have made, given that if there is any sort of vacuum, that vacuum also directly affects their border.  </p><p>So unless they have a plan in place to continue to secure these areas, it would potentially be vulnerable for a reemergence of ISIS or for new battle lines to unfold.  We really don't know.</p><p>I mean, Syria just gets messier every single time we talk about it. And, of course, it all comes at the expense of the civilian population.</p><p>HERTLING:  You know, Brooke, if I can add too, we're talking -- Arwa is rightfully talking about what will happen to the Kurds.  They have just conducted an operation in a place called Hajin.  </p><p>We have trainers in a place in Southern Syria called al (INAUDIBLE) that the Russians have asked us to get out of.  Here's the other interesting piece.  We are not only doing these kind of operations, but we're also leading many allied nations in this part of the world.  </p><p>There are allied special operations working with us.  To wake up and find out that the president hasn't addressed our members of Congress in terms of this action, you can bet he hasn't addressed the national leaders of some of the allied nations that we're dealing with in this area, too.  </p><p>[15:10:04]</p><p>So again, it's just -- it's throwing more chaos into an already very complex situation.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Got it.  General, thank you very much.  And, Arwa, thank you.</p><p>Now to our breaking financial news.  Excuse me.  The financial -- the Federal Reserve ignored President Trump's repeated requests and went ahead and raised a key interest rate.  So, moments ago, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, Trump -- excuse me -- I blame it on the end of the year.  I don't know.  We're all getting sick.  </p><p>Jay Powell, a Trump appointee, was asked about the pressure coming from the president.  Here is how he responded:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN NOMINEE:  Political considerations have -- play no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy.  We're always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us.  </p><p>We have the tools to carry it about.  We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way. And we are -- we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN:  And we're going to talk about it after a break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[15:15:39]</p><p>BALDWIN:  Welcome back.</p><p>All right, so before the break, we were talking about the Fed raising interest rates for the fourth time this year.  </p><p>So I have with me \"Washington Post\" columnist and CNN political commentator Catherine Rampell.</p><p>Welcome to you.</p><p>So, we now know that they're going to raise the rates 2.5 percent. The markets, they have been going back and forth, now down about 300 points right now reacting to this.  </p><p>What does this mean for the economy?  What does this mean for people with credit card debt, that kind of thing?</p><p>CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Sure.</p><p>So this was widely expected that they were going to raise rates today. They had signaled it for a very long time, despite the fact that Trump clearly very vocally did not want them to.  So I think this is not a surprise.  </p><p>What was a little more interesting, what we didn't know as much about was what the Fed says is going to happen next year.  And they actually downgraded their expectations for growth next year.  They said, growth is going to be a little bit slower than they had said, that they had forecast a couple of months ago.  </p><p>And, accordingly, they also said that they're probably not going to raise rates as much next year.  So I guess Trump may be happy about that, although the reason behind the fewer expected rate hikes has to do with the fact that the economy may have more weakness in it.  </p><p>And we have seen some signs of that from the stock market, right?  The stock market has been sort of whipsawing back and forth.  The stock market is not the economy, so I want to be clear about that.  But it does give us some -- you know, some tea leaves to read, at the very least, about...</p><p>BALDWIN:  What are you reading?</p><p>RAMPELL:  So, for example, the things that the market has been freaked out about have to do with the trade war, the trade war with China, I should say trade wars, plural, since we have them on multiple fronts at this point.  </p><p>And if you look at what economists are worried about, it is also the trade war with China.  There was this recent \"Wall Street Journal\" survey in which about half of economists who were surveyed said that the single biggest threat to the U.S. economy next year was, in fact, the U.S.-China trade war, especially, of course, if tariffs go up more.   That very same survey also found that a majority of economists were expecting a recession by 2020.  So that's one example.  There are other things going on.  There's been some weakness in the housing market.  The health care sector has also been sort of dealing with this great uncertainty as a result of Obamacare potentially being struck down.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Sure.  Sure.</p><p>RAMPELL:  So, there are number of risks that are out there in the economy that we should be certainly keeping an eye on.</p><p>This expansion is now about to become the longest expansion on record, so, statistically speaking, like, we are sort of overdue for a recession.  But at the moment, the Fed just says growth is slowing. They're not forecasting...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALDWIN:  Here's what we have specifically, just to put a button on what you're saying.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Jerome Powell says, political considerations have -- quote -- \"played no role,\" a la, the president inserting himself and tweeting about this and the Fed's decisions -- quote -- \"Nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do.\"</p><p>So, Catherine Rampell, thank you.</p><p>RAMPELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, they are racing to try and prevent a partial government shutdown on Friday.  But a short-term spending bill to keep the government running could dash President Trump's hopes of money for a border wall.</p><p>Just over a week ago, the president was refusing to budge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security.</p><p>I will take the mantle.  I will be the to shut it down.  I'm not going to blame you for it.  The last time you shut it down it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN:  But this is what White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway just said this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER:  This is all breaking news, in other words, what the Congress is going to put before him, a short- term C.R. a C.R. that goes through to February 8, keeps the government up and running.  </p><p>But that doesn't mean the president is backing down from a central promise, not a campaign promise, a promise as president of the United States and our commander in chief, to keep us safe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BALDWIN:  CNN correspondent Ryan Nobles is following the developments for us on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>And so, as far as the C.R. is concerned, the short-term spending bill, what's the likelihood that happens?  </p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Brooke, I think we are as reasonably confident as you can be before a vote is cast that they're going to avert the shutdown in some way, shape or form.  </p><p>Senate leaders said just a few minutes ago that they plan on voting on this continuing resolution sometime this afternoon.  Leaders on the House side have expressed support for it as well.  </p><p>And even Vice President Pence told Senate leaders in a closed-door luncheon about an hour ago that the president would sign this clean C.R. to keep the government open until February 8.  </p><p>[15:20:03]</p><p>So, we think it's going to get done, Brooke, but you never know until the votes are cast.  But it's important to point out, as you clearly stated, this doesn't include a lot of these things that the president was hoping for a win.  </p><p>At one point, it appeared as though he was going to use this for leverage to get funding for that border wall.  That doesn't appear to be part of the game plan for President Trump right now.  They seem not willing at least to go to that point to shut down a significant portion of the government in exchange for getting that funding, at least not at this point -- Brooke.</p><p>BALDWIN:  So if they go with the C.R., that means they would take it back up at the top of the year.  That would then be when the Democrats are majority in the House.  What then would that mean for his big border wall?  </p><p>NOBLES:  Well, there's no doubt that this process becomes increasingly more difficult for President Trump once Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House and the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>But you already see how the White House is pivoting to a certain degree when it comes to funding for the border wall.  And it seems more and more likely that if they find this funding, it won't come in some form of direct congressional authorization.</p><p>In other words, the White House is going to try and get creative with their budgeting tactics and try and find that money elsewhere.  Could it come in the form of a line item in a budget that is just for broad border security, and then the Department of Homeland Security uses that to pay for a border wall?  </p><p>Or do they find money from other departments, ask Cabinet secretaries to find funding in their budgets that is to some degree fungible and turn that into funding for the border wall?  That's difficult, Brooke. That's not an easy process.  </p><p>But that seems to be one of the only few options that this White House has left if President Trump's going to make good on this promise to his supporters to build a physical wall along the southern border.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Got it.  Ryan, thank you very much on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>Coming up next:  Facebook is now facing a lawsuit from the D.C. attorney general for sharing your information with third parties.  We have details on that and the new report that Facebook was also sharing users' private messages with other tech companies.</p><p>Hear how they're responding.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[15:26:41]</p><p>BALDWIN:  More fallout from Facebook today.</p><p>The D.C. attorney general has just filed a lawsuit against them over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  The lawsuit alleges Facebook failed to protect users' data during the 2016 election and allowed third-party applications to manipulate -- to manipulate it -- easy for me to say -- for its political purposes.  </p><p>So, this all comes on the heels of a searing \"New York Times\" report that reveals Facebook offered big tech companies your personal information without asking you first.  Internal Facebook documents obtained by \"The Times\" revealed, in some cases, your private messages were shared.  </p><p>CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter is with me now.</p><p>So, starting with \"The Times\"' reporting, what exactly was shared and how is Facebook responding to this?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this was kind of like a secret front door that was there.</p><p>Facebook propped it open for years, allowing all these technology companies, as you mentioned, Spotify and Netflix and Microsoft and Amazon and others, to peer through that front door if they wanted.   Now, a lot of these companies -- you see them on screen here -- they say, hey, we didn't actually use this feature.  Netflix says, we weren't looking at your private messages.  </p><p>But the point is that Facebook enabled that access, allowed it as a possibility.  And that is creepy.  For all these tech companies, sometimes, it's about passing the creepy test.  Does that seem creepy? Well, yes, it obviously seems creepy to be able to access private messages of users, when you're not even at Facebook, if you're at some other company.</p><p>So what does Facebook say?  They say this was a part of a partner program.  All of our partners made Facebook better.  They made the Web better by making it more feature -- more user-friendly.  </p><p>But I think this is another example of Facebook's worst year ever, a year full of privacy scandals and revelations about how, in some cases, users are not just helped out, they're abused by these technologies and tools.</p><p>Here's a part of the company's statement acknowledging they need to improve in some ways.  </p><p>They say, look, companies, partners, they \"don't get to ignore people's privacy settings.  But we have got work to do to regain people's trust.\"  They say: \"Partnerships are an area of focus this year.  And, as we have said, we are winding down that integration partnership that was built to help people across Facebook.\"</p><p>So, in other words, they say that front door, the front door is closed now.  But I think there's this broader issue, Brooke, about what else is Facebook doing that we might not even know about?  It's a black box.</p><p>BALDWIN:  They say the front door is closed.  What can people do who are -- have all their Facebook accounts and rely on Facebook?  What can they do to protect themselves?</p><p>STELTER:  Other than deleting Facebook, which I know some people say they're doing, but is maybe unrealistic for a lot of folks watching, you can do a privacy checkup, you can log on to Facebook or Instagram or WhatsApp.  They own all of them.</p><p>Do a checkup, make sure that you don't -- you haven't left any lights on by accident, left any doors open by accident.  But the reality is, I think people are largely at the whims of these giant technology companies.  </p><p>And that's why this attorney general suit in D.C. today is interesting.  Washington, kind of in general, regulators in general, they have been asleep about this for several years, but they are waking up now.  </p><p>A number of Democratic lawmakers spoke out against -- when \"The New York Times\" story came out last night, a number of Democratic congressman said, this is really troubling.  We need to do more.   So there's definitely a sense of regulation in the air, a sense of possible oversight in the air, because, frankly, Brooke, \"The New York Times\" is not enough in terms of oversight.  CNN is not enough in terms of oversight.  We actually need to see the government ensure people's privacy, in the same way they do in lots of other industries. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALDWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>STELTER:  And technology can't be -- can't be the exception to the rule.  </p><p>BALDWIN:  Yes.  </p><p>Brian Stelter, thank you very much for that.</p><p>STELTER:  Thanks.</p><p>BALDWIN:  Next:  A former Green Beret who admitted to killing a suspected Taliban bomb-maker is now charged with murder and facing death.  </p><p>President Trump says he may intervene in the case.  </p><p>[Byline: Brian Stelter, Ryan Nobles, Catherine Rampell, Mark Hertling, Arwa Damon, Brooke Baldwin] [High: President Trump claims the war against ISIS is over and announces his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched on Facebook the most outstanding fine of which there is a record in the technology sector: 5 billion dollars (4.4 billion euros).<br/>\u00a0<br/>The CEO of Facebook was already prepared to receive a penalty of this order on the part of the FTC. In April, in the presentation of the quarterly results, it was estimated that the multase was between 3 billion and 5 billion dollars.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The investigation was triggered by the information revealed in March 2018 according to which the British consultant Cambridge Analytica used an application to collect data from 87 million of Facebook users without their knowledge and for political purposes.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The company used data from Facebook to elaborate psychological profiles of voters, who allegedly came to sell to the campaign of the now president of the U.S., Donald Trump, during the elections of 2016, among other clients.

And, watch, it just might happen again.</p><p>In the early days of the internet, connectivity was viewed as the great equalizer: Democratizing publishing, rendering geographic distance inconsequential, upending established power structures and disrupting traditional business models.</p><p>But as the internet has grown and matured, the outcome has been just the opposite. The result? A dangerously small number of corporations have come to monopolize our digital lives.</p><p>Attention is the single most important commodity in the digital economy. And the absolute titan in that regard is Facebook.</p><p>After YouTube and Facebook, among the most-used platforms are WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, with 1.5 billion, 1.3 billion and 700 million users apiece.</p><p>And guess what? All three are owned by Facebook.</p><p>So, how has Facebook - a single company - been allowed to accumulate so much of the market share?</p><p>The truth is, internet companies operate in a field that is scarcely understood by either customers or regulators. But more than that, in any match between Big Government and Big Technology, Big Tech always wins.</p><p>And so, between the novelty of the product, the ignorance of the consumer and the absence of government regulation, a $445-billion company has been able to take deep root.</p><p>However, that era of unimpeded growth may be coming to an end. The aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election brought with it an acknowledgement that these platforms were effectively weaponized by hostile foreign powers.</p><p>The unprecedented accumulation of personal data by these companies has created all manner of potential liabilities, and foreign interference in elections is only one example.</p><p>The consequence is that a new level of scrutiny has begun.</p><p>The Canadian government has announced that a panel of civil servants has been deputized to watch for foreign interference during election campaigns.</p><p>The federal parliamentary committee on privacy and ethics has made 26 recommendations that would block hate speech, limit surveillance and protect user privacy.</p><p>And, just this week, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould testified before the procedure and house affairs committee, suggesting a critical examination of the role of social media in democracies with a view to holding the social media companies to account.</p><p>In the U.K., a select committee of the House of Commons issued its final report on the inquiry into disinformation and fake news. Among the committee's findings, Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated privacy and anti-competition laws.</p><p>According to the report, \"big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight. But only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them. The legislative tools already exist. They must now be applied to digital activity, using tools such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law.\"</p><p>Since the beginning, missteps were priced into Facebook's success. Mark Zuckerberg's motto was \"move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Surely, that wasn't intended to extend to the public trust.</p><p>Short of antitrust action, Facebook's gravest threat may well be that the user - of what is ultimately an advertising business, and therefore the product - will eventually grow bored of the service or weary of scandal and walk away.</p><p>Polls tell us the public professes to be concerned about digital privacy. And yet, when Facebook announced its annual results last month, after a bruising year of drip, drip, drip revelations of questionable conduct, from Cambridge Analytica to accusations of fomenting genocide in Myanmar, usership was actually up across the board, in every region of the world.</p><p>All of which, of course, asks the question: so long as users are not prepared to abandon Facebook, how much political capital will governments expend on policy prescriptions to regulate it?</p><p>Jaime Watt is the executive chairman of Navigator Ltd. and a Conservative strategist.

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook's long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/\">Facebook Reality Labs</url>, it has announced new applications like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-debuts-infinite-office-a-virtual-reality-office-space/\">Infinite Office VR workplace</url>, and will also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition\">require a Facebook login</url> for future Oculus devices.</p><p>The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant's <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/why-the-business-model-of-social-media-giants-like-facebook-is-incompatible-with-human-rights-94016\">chequered history with privacy and data</url>. VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we're likely to invite into our homes in the next decade. </p><h>Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?</h><p>Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality\">an estimated US$2.3 billion</url>.

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.</p><p><br/>Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 (from AUD$479) is a powerful wireless VR headset for gaming and, Facebook hopes, much more. The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook's long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of Facebook Reality Labs , it has announced new applications like the Infinite Office VR workplace , and will also require a Facebook login for future Oculus devices.The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant's chequered history with privacy and data . VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we're likely to invite into our homes in the next decade. Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for an estimated US$2.3 billion . But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media. At the same event last year, Zuckerberg said Facebook sees VR as a pathway to a new kind of 'social computing platform' using the enhanced feeling of 'presence' that VR affords. For Facebook, the introduction of VR-based computing will be like the leap from text-based command line interfaces to the graphical user interfaces we use today. This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning and connecting with others at a distance.But if the VR future is the one Facebook is ' working in the lab ' on, it will function via the company's existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements. Virtual reality collects real dataA VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key ethical issues of emerging 'mixed reality' technologies.As AmericanVR researcher Jeremy Bailenson has written : The way you move your body can be used to identify you , like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity. Facebook's Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.<br/>FacebookVR headsets use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) to track the movements of the headset in 3D space. This is also another opportunity for collecting data about the world. In late 2019 Facebook said they 'don't collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today'. Note the word today, which tech journalist Ben Lang notes makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future. Virtual reality leads to augmented realityFacebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR).Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings. Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you've left your keys on the coffee table.<br/>Facebook's Live Maps application is a vision of a Facebook owned AR platform. Now Facebook have announced their first steps towards making this a reality: Project Aria . This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls 'the mirrorworld ', the next big tech platform. Read more: Pok\u00e9mon Go wants to make 3D scans of the whole world for 'planet-scale augmented reality experiences'. Is that good? People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles page, and they're already quick to emphasise that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection. As we have argued elsewhere , framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That's because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of Cambridge Analytica ) and their asymmetric platform power . Read more: Why the business model of social media giants like Facebook is incompatible with human rights We need more than just 'tech ethics'Groups like the XR Safety Initiative recognise these emerging issues, and are beginning work on standards, guidelines and privacy frameworks to shape VR and AR development.Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as the Collingridge problem : it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change.We see this playing out right now, in efforts to regulate Google and Facebook's power over news media .As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability : What might regulation of Facebook's VR look like? Germany offers one such response - their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook withdrawing the headset from sale .

The new device packs more computing power and a sharper screen than its predecessor, and is also US$100 cheaper.    [embedded content]   Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest 2 is a powerful wireless VR headset for gaming and, Facebook hopes, much more.   The Oculus Quest 2 is the latest step in Facebook\u2019s long-term strategy of making VR more accessible and popular. Facebook recently brought all its VR work under the umbrella of  Facebook Reality Labs , it has announced new applications like the  Infinite Office VR workplace , and will also  require a Facebook login  for future Oculus devices.    The compulsory link to Facebook has many consumers concerned, considering the social media giant\u2019s  chequered history with privacy and data . VR and its cousin, augmented reality (AR), are perhaps the most data-extractive digital sensors we\u2019re likely to invite into our homes in the next decade.   Why does Facebook make virtual reality headsets?   Facebook acquired VR company Oculus in 2014 for  an estimated US$2.3 billion . But where Oculus originally aimed at gamers, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg wants VR for social media.    At the same event last year, Zuckerberg said Facebook sees VR as a pathway to a new kind of \u201csocial computing platform\u201d using the enhanced feeling of \u201cpresence\u201d that VR affords. For Facebook, the introduction of VR-based computing will be like the leap from text-based command line interfaces to the graphical user interfaces we use today.    This may well be right. VR affords a strong feeling of embodied presence that offers new possibilities for entertainment, training, learning and connecting with others at a distance.    But if the VR future is the one Facebook is \u201c working in the lab \u201d on, it will function via the company\u2019s existing social computing platform and business model of extracting data to deliver targeted advertisements.   Virtual reality collects real data   A VR headset collects data about the user, but also about the outside world. This is one of the key  ethical issues  of emerging \u201cmixed reality\u201d technologies.    As AmericanVR researcher  Jeremy Bailenson has written :    \u2026commercial VR systems typically track body movements 90 times per second to display the scene appropriately, and high-end systems record 18 types of movements across the head and hands. Consequently, spending 20 minutes in a VR simulation leaves just under 2 million unique recordings of body language.    The way you move your body can be  used to identify you , like a fingerprint, so everything you do in VR could be traced back to your individual identity.    Facebook\u2019s Oculus Quest headsets also use outward-facing cameras to track and map their surroundings.    [embedded content]   FacebookVR headsets use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) to track the movements of the headset in 3D space. This is also another opportunity for collecting data about the world.   In late 2019  Facebook said  they \u201cdon\u2019t collect and store images or 3D maps of your environment on our servers today\u201d. Note the word  today , which tech journalist  Ben Lang notes  makes clear the company is not ruling out anything in the future.   Virtual reality leads to augmented reality   Facebook wants to collect this data to facilitate its plans for augmented reality (AR).    Where VR takes a user to a fully virtual environment, AR combines virtual elements with our real surroundings.    Last year Facebook unveiled the Live Maps application, a vision of an expansive surveillance apparatus presumably powered by AR glasses and data collected from Oculus Insight. Live Maps will provide many minor conveniences for Facebook users, like letting you know you\u2019ve left your keys on the coffee table.    [embedded content]   Facebook\u2019s Live Maps application is a vision of a Facebook owned AR platform.   Now Facebook have announced their first steps towards making this a reality:  Project Aria . This will involve people wearing glasses-like sensors around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area, to collect the data to build what Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly calls  \u201cthe mirrorworld \u201d, the next big tech platform.    People are rightly concerned about the ethical implications of this kind of data extraction. Alongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles  page, and they\u2019re already quick to emphasise that faces and license plates will be blurred in this data collection.    As we have  argued elsewhere , framing questions about VR and AR surveillance in terms of individual privacy suits companies like Facebook very well. That\u2019s because their previous failings are actually in the (un)ethical use of data (as in the case of  Cambridge Analytica ) and their  asymmetric platform power .   We need more than just \u2018tech ethics\u2019   Groups like the  XR Safety Initiative  recognise these emerging issues, and are beginning work on  standards, guidelines and privacy frameworks  to shape VR and AR development.    Many emerging technologies encounter what is known as  the Collingridge problem : it is hard to predict the various impacts of a technology until it is extensively developed and widely used, but by then it is almost impossible to control or change.    We see this playing out right now, in efforts to  regulate Google and Facebook\u2019s power over news media .    As David Watts argues, big tech designs its own rules of ethics to  avoid scrutiny and accountability :    Feelgood, high-level data ethics principles are not fit for the purpose of regulating big tech \u2026 The harms linked to big tech can only be addressed by proper regulation.    What might regulation of Facebook\u2019s VR look like? Germany offers one such response \u2013 their antitrust regulations have resulted in Facebook  withdrawing the headset from sale . We can only hope the technology doesn\u2019t become too entrenched to be changed, or challenged.    But regulation has not always stopped Facebook in the past, who paid out  US$550 million  to settle a lawsuit for breaching biometric privacy laws. In the multi-billion dollar world of big-tech, it\u2019s all a cost of doing business.    Another question we might ask ourselves is whether Facebook\u2019s virtual-reality future and others like it really need to exist. Maybe there are other ways to avoid forgetting your keys.
