I appreciate this opportunity to talk about broadcasters vital role in protecting the First Amendment and serving Americas local communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just a few days ago, Americans celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On that unforgettable day, an estimated 650 million people around the world tuned into their televisions as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Families and friends took a collective breath as they listened to Armstrong utter these memorable words, Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</p><p>One-fifth of the worlds population watched the live televised image of the moon landing that day, with millions of others also listening to the event on their radios.</p><p>As we reflect upon this special anniversary, I and we are reminded of how broadcasters are always there to capture the most indelible moments in history. Broadcasters have the unique ability to bring us together as a nation like no other medium can.</p><p>The world has changed dramatically in the five decades since the Apollo 11 moon landing. Indeed, the media landscape seems to have changed in the blink of an eye, and continues to rapidly progress.</p><p>Today, in addition to local radio and television stations, there are a multitude of sources of information and content, giving consumers an overwhelming number of options and creating greater competition.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were nearly 240 million websites. Today, there are more than 1.6 billion.</p><p>The rise of social media has presented another platform for people to connect with each other, share and gain information and express opinions. 500 million Tweets are sent a day and 1.56 billion people a day log onto Facebook.</p><p>And though the number of people who are using social media as a source for news is growing, sorting fact from fiction has become more challenging on these platforms.</p><p>In my two decades as a public servant and now more than a decade as a broadcaster, I have witnessed the growing influence of social media and wonder if its no coincidence that we have also seen the rise of divisive politics. In my last Senate campaign, in 2008, the glue of civility seemed to come apart in our civic discourse and a decade later, it has only gotten worse.</p><p>Though the rise of social media can be seen as democratizing, giving a greater number of people the opportunity to express their thoughts and opinions in an open forum, I believe it has also been a destabilizing force that has impacted our society in troubling ways. The paradox of social media democratizing, yet destabilizing. Again, I am a witness</p><p>There doesnt seem to be an appetite for civil discourse on these platforms. Rather, one can more easily find heated debates fueled by name callingor rumors and gossip that try to pass as journalistic news, and, unfortunately, sometimes succeed.</p><p>And what you find on pay TV can also be unsettling there the so-called news is fraught with partisan bickering, where the end-goal seems to be having the last word.</p><p>Sadly, we have become a more fragmented society where the winners and losers are quickly identified minute-by-minute on social media and where the truth and thoughtful debate are suppressed by the proliferation of fake news and false accounts.</p><p>Not surprisingly, a recent Ballast Research survey revealed that only two percent of policymakers believe social media is committed to hard factsand 90 percent believe that social media is part of the so called fake news problem.</p><p>It is a challenging time in the news industry where our citizens are overwhelmed by so much information and confused about finding the truth. That is why I believe broadcast radio and television are more important today than they have ever been.</p><p>Broadcasters give our communities coherence survey after survey show that people trust their local stations that deliver the news accurately and without bias.</p><p>Local stations investigations protect consumers from scams and their reporting of local elections help voters make informed decisions.</p><p>Broadcast networks provide high-quality and hard-hitting investigative stories and thoughtful public affairs programming such as 60 Minutes, Meet the Press and This Week, and presidential debates, that keep citizens informed and hold elected officials accountable for their actions.</p><p>Its unfortunate that at a time when this trusted information is so critical to our communities, some of our pay-TV partners, like ATandT and DISH, seem to be purposefully withholding broadcast signals from viewers making them pawns in a political game that aims to upend the retransmission consent system.</p><p>Is their goal to manufacture the appearance of a broken system to encourage Congress to intervene just as it deliberates the upcoming STELAR expiration? If so, that is a dangerous game and one that hurts viewers their customers the most.</p><p>But, sadly, its not all that surprising. After all, ATandT and DISH are the same companies that have been responsible for more than four out of five retransmission consent disruptions industry-wide over the past eight years.</p><p>ATandT is the same company that is currently making decisions to withhold its content from viewers on competing platforms in the immediate aftermath of a merger where they committed just the opposite to regulators.</p><p>It is the same company asking for exorbitant fees for their own content offerings, while refusing to fairly compensate broadcasters highest-rated programming.</p><p>And finally, ATandT is the same 300 billion dollar company that for years has chosen to exploit STELARs distant signal license rather than invest in the communities they serve by failing to offer those subscribers their local broadcast stations.</p><p>For example, how does seeing the weather forecast from New York City help the viewer in Bowling Green, Kentucky, when a life-threatening storm is on its way to their town? Its time to let STELAR expire. Lets stop subsidizing billion-dollar companies, like ATandT, and instead ensure all Americans have access to the most accurate and timely source of news, sporting events, weather and emergency information their local TV broadcasters.</p><p>The simple fact is, the retransmission consent process is a free-market system that works. Ninety-nine percent of all deals get done without interruption. And, my guess is that 100 percent would get reached if pay-TV companies do not purposefully try to create a problem simply so Congress attempts to fix it to their benefit.</p><p>If not for the compensation broadcasters receive for their highly-valued programming programming that ATandT, DISH and others re-sell to customers broadcasters would be unable to support investigative journalism and expensive sports coverage and invest in sophisticated weather operations that save lives and provide in-depth local news coverage.</p><p>It is our hope that policymakers will remember that, while our over-the-air programming is free to the viewer, our content is expensive. It is all paid for from two sources advertising and retransmission consent.</p><p>Even in todays hyper-competitive media environment, broadcast programming remains the most watched. Last year, 95 of the 100 most watched shows aired on broadcast television. And while no one denies that retransmission consent fees have increased, broadcast stations still remain under-compensated relative to the viewership of their video competitors.</p><p>ATandT collects 6 billion dollars annually in affiliate fees from its own Warner Media cable properties like TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network. And yet, these cable networks ratings pale in comparison to the ratings of local broadcast affiliates. Last year, the typical Big Four TV broadcast affiliate delivered on average nearly four times more viewers every night than even the most-watched Warner Media channel.</p><p>Beyond the highest-rated entertainment programming, broadcasters are carrying the mantle of investigative journalism at a time when local newspapers are closing up shop and unreliable information is free flowing on social media. Broadcasters continue to be a beacon of our First Amendment, and retransmission consent revenue enables broadcasters to protect these precious rights.</p><p>CBS anchor Walter Cronkite once said, Freedom of the press is not just important to democracy, it is democracy.</p><p>Our steadfast belief in this inspires us to join our friends at the Media Institute in fiercely defending our First Amendment rights, and relentlessly pursuing and reporting the facts without fear or favor.</p><p>No other media industry not social media or the big technology companies will ever have local broadcasters commitment to the investigative journalism that exposes government corruption and other abuses of power.</p><p>And, no other media industry will ever match broadcasters commitment to providing a lifeline when disaster strikes.</p><p>None of our competitors will ever have what broadcasters have that make us so unique our connection to local communities.</p><p>As broadcasters advocates in our nations capital, NAB is ensuring that policymakers and the rest of America truly understand the many ways local stations give backand our desire to always be there for our communities is what inspires us to constantly innovate.</p><p>The development of new technologies means more platforms for broadcast journalists to deliver the stories our communities rely on every day for free.</p><p>We are excited about Next Generation Television, also known as ATSC 3.0, and the convergence of over-the-air and over-the-top, resulting in an enhanced viewing experience.</p><p>Were also actively working with automakers and internet service providers from around the globe to develop the next generation of radio, which combines broadcasting with internet connectivity to create new user experiences in the connected car.</p><p>Winning our legislative and regulatory battles on Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission ensures broadcasters will be able to capitalize on future innovations and continue to flourish for generations to come.</p><p>And, in order for broadcasters to provide new technologies to better serve our communities, we also need to be competitive with tech companies and the media and telecommunications industries. This means broadcasters need the freedom to quickly develop new products and services without unnecessary regulations.</p><p>Lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in this challenging landscape by modernizing outdated broadcast regulations that prevent us from competing on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies.</p><p>This is essential to ensuring broadcast journalism thrives at a time when communities need it most.</p><p>I am reminded of what Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in his 1919 dissent in the Supreme Court case Abrams vs. United States, the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market</p><p>I believe there is an antidote to this age of so-called fake news: More truthful journalism, which broadcasters can provideand making it available on every device.</p><p>Broadcasters are making great strides in this effort.</p><p>And, though we grapple with the challenges to investigative and truthful journalism posed by social media and big tech companies, we remain energized by the innovations shaping the future of broadcast. We will continue to work to ensure both radio and TV are available wherever listeners and viewers are.</p><p>In another 50 years, broadcasting will continue to evolve, but there are some things technology will never change.</p><p>Our communities will always turn to their local TV and radio stations to follow the inspiring events that have shaped our nation.</p><p>They will always count on us to be their eyes and ears to guide them to safety during times of crisis to share lifes greatest moments and to connect to families, friends and neighbors.</p><p>They will always count on us to be the megaphones for freedom and democracy.</p><p>And, broadcasters will always be there for our communities, whenever and however they need us most.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>* * *</p><p>About NAB</p><p>The National Association of Broadcasters is the premier advocacy association for America's broadcasters.

It was recently reported, indeed, that Apple is quietly looking to make <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">more money from targeted advertising</url>, since growth in iPhone sales has slowed. It is in the interest of both corporations to have you looking at ads for as many hours of the day as humanly possible.</p><p>At the same time, they are aware of big tech's increasingly tarnished reputation since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">Snowden revelations</url> and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url>. Studies       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">link social-media</url> use to anxiety and depression, and a movement is growing in Silicon Valley called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">Time Well Spent</url>, which calls for more humane design that reduces the time we spend on devices. (Earlier this year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">citing Time Well Spent</url>, Facebook changed its newsfeed in a way that supposedly encourages users to spend less time on the site while having more fun.)</p><p>Rather than wait for sterner regulation to be foisted on them, Apple and Google are going on a PR offensive to seem concerned about their users. Rather than solving the underlying problems themselves, however, they are shunting on to us yet more soul-sucking digital management busywork.</p><p>The real paradox here remains that of trying to help people be less addicted to products that are engineered to be as addictive as possible. Smartphones, social media sites and the like are full of design decisions - such as pull-to-refresh, or infinite scrolling - that actively hijack the brain's reward system. They create what the behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, in his studies of animal conditioning, called a schedule of \"intermittent reinforcement\", which he found was a very good way to maintain a particular behaviour in lab rats. Now we are all lab rats, desperately pawing the lever in our digital Skinner boxes in the hope of the next crunchy info-pellet.</p><p>Even the mere knowledge that your smartphone might buzz with a new message while you are doing something else has been found to disrupt attention. Few people have the psychic fortitude to follow the example of the technology critic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">Evgeny Morozov</url>, who locks his internet router and phone in a safe when he wants to do some work. Given all this, the promise that new functions in these machines will help us break our addictions might seem rather cynical. It's as though every pack of cigarettes came with free nicotine patches.</p><p>Still, what else are we going to do? The idea of just not using our tech so much is unthinkable. Better to trust that, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sleepradio.co.nz/our-free-app\">Homer Simpson said of alcohol</url>, technology is the cause of, and solution to, all life's problems. And the paradigm of tech actively helping you not to use it could profitably be extended to other areas.</p><p>Tinder could do the drudge work of rejecting boorish suitors with an algorithm that writes your brush-offs for you. Uber could refuse to take you to the pub and suggest the walk would do you good. And rather than autoplaying the next episode in the series you are binging on, Netflix could sternly tell you it's 2.30am, that you are slumped on the sofa covered in crisps and really should go to bed now, and then turn itself off. I could go on, but my laptop has just warned me that I've exceeded my sarcasm quota for the morning.</p><p>\u00b7 Steven Poole is the author of Rethink, You Aren't What You Eat, Unspeak, and Trigger Happy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-44577839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH9-JG31-JCJY-G12R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><timeReceived>9:08 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

He also provided a key update in the agency's digital-health regulation plans, put his cards on the table regarding laboratory-developed-test policymaking, and made some substantive points on how industry should respond to the ongoing devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Check out the full speech and Q&amp;A from The Medtech Conference in the following video. And, below the video player, we summarize some of Gottlieb's key comments and takeaways.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p>CDRH: FDA's Seed Of Innovation?</p><p>\"Some of the most creative and forward-leaning advances in regulatory policy are what we are doing on the medical device side of the FDA house,\" Gottlieb told meeting attendees.</p><p>He pointed out, as an example, that at a recent meeting he attended focusing on the use of real-word evidence for pharmaceuticals drew heavily on policies that are already in place on the device side of FDA.  CDRH is also leading the way on a range of other issues, including in developing a benefit-risk framework, reshifting the balance of pre-market and post-market data, and creating to an <url normalizedValue=\"https://medtech.pharmamedtechbi.com/MT121568/Super-Office-To-The-Rescue-FDAs-Device-Center-Is-About-To-Undergo-A-Total-Product-Life-Cycle-Makeover\">overarching \"total product lifecycle\" office</url>, Gottlieb said.</p><p>\"These policy advances, first engineered in CDRH, are going viral at FDA,\" he pronounced.</p><p>Name-Checking Big Tech</p><p>As previously reported by Medtech Insight, Gottlieb also announced the participants in FDA's nascent \"Pre-Cert\" pilot program, which is focused on establishing a pre-certification program for health software that could reduce or replace traditional pre-market device requirements. Apple, FitBit and Verily joined Johnson &amp; Johnson and Roche among the nine companies that will be directly assisting FDA in the efforts. <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmamedtechbi.com//MT121546//\">\"Excellence In HealthSoftware Design US FDA Taps Nine Firms To Figure Out What That Means\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url></p><p>\"Our team will be spending the rest of the year working closely with these companies to deepen our understanding of their methodologies and how their technologies operate,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>LDTs: A Legislative Priority?</p><p>During the Q&amp;A with Whitaker, Gottlieb forcefully argued that new regulatory framework for laboratory-developed tests should be a priority and it should be Congress, and not FDA, that primarily makes it happen with legislation. </p><p>\"I am working very hard toward that goal. I will have and have had conversations around Capitol Hill on these issues. I am going continue to speak out publicly,\" he said.</p><p>FDA has been working in fits and starts for decades to establish a framework to actively oversee tests that are produced and performed as services in the same laboratory, despite opposition from many in the lab community. A major effort to finalize such a framework fell apart in the 11th hour last November after the surprise election of Donald Trump to the White House  <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmamedtechbi.com//MT104126//\">\"FDA May Be Changing The LDT Game Plan\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url></p><p>But Gottlieb still sees an opportunity to make something happen, pointing to better consensus on the issue than in the past, and to promising legislative vehicle that could pass within the year to authorize user-fee programs for over-the-counter drugs and animal drugs. \"I think we have an opportunity to work on a framework on appropriate regulation of LDT tests for the long run as part of that legislative vehicle,\" Gottlieb said. \"My view is it would be a missed opportunity if we didn't.\"</p><p>The commissioner also hinted at an approach to LDT regulation that he favors, specifically, modeling the Pre-Cert program that is currently being formulated for digital health products, where labs could be pre-certified based on their test-design process.</p><p>\"This construct could form part of the framework for a modern legislative approach to laboratory-developed tests,\" he said.</p><p>Puerto Rico: Worse Than Perceived</p><p>Gottlieb has been very public and out front in recent weeks since Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, even traveling to the island last week. Drug and device manufacturing facilities make up a substantial part of the economic activity of Puerto Rico and part of Gottlieb's focus has been helping to facilitate operations getting back up and running to avoid shortages. </p><p>\"I will tell you that the situation is a lot worse than what we perceive from the news on the island,\" Gottlieb told Whitaker. \"The facilities themselves seem to be relatively intact. But it is a matter of getting supplies to facilities and getting people back into the facilities.\"</p><p>Asked for tips for companies that have local facilities that are responding to the disaster  Gottlieb recommended: \"Make sure you are feeding up information to multiple channels. Just because you have a conversation with someone who works for the assistant secretary of emergency preparedness at HHS, [or] you talked to someone at DHS - made one contact - if I was a company with a critical issue, I would make sure I had that same conversation with as many touch points as possible, including with FDA. Don't be shy about that.\"</p><p>He emphasized that while the focus is \"obviously on the people of Puerto Rico,\" that he is \"not going to shy away in the coming weeks [to talk] about the need of providing relief to the facilities.</p><p>\"What is going to be critical to the recovery of Puerto Rico is getting people working again, getting the economy restarted, and the medical-product-manufacturer base is a huge part of that economy. The vast majority of that economy is driven by that. Puerto Rico's economic future is dependent upon us getting these facilities restarted and not seeing companies relocate their facility permanently. That would be the worst possible outcome. But that is a risk. We are all cognizant of that.\"</p><p>Cures As Template For Reform</p><p>Gottlieb also made some interesting comments about the implications of the 21st Century Cures Act. Enacted last December, the legislation includes a range of FDA reforms, including several impacting devices. <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmamedtechbi.com//MT105017//\">\"21st Century Cures Implementation Device Provision Updates\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url> But the commissioner pointed out that he views the bill not just as a list of provisions to implement but also a \"template upon which we can embed other policies.\"</p><p>\"The ability to build around the Cures initiative with other policy effort that are very related to Cures, but not explicitly described in Cures, becomes very seductive,\" he said. \"It is a very useful vehicle for things, where we have an expression of congressional intent. It is not just the agency trying to divine policy on its own, but we are following the intent of Congress and what they laid out in Cures.\"</p><p>Gottlieb seems to have taken this approach in the digital-health realm, where FDA is implementing specific Cures provisions to keep certain software types outside of the agency's jurisdiction, but infusing with it  a host of additional deregulatory digital-health initiatives, including but not limited to Pre-Cert. <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmamedtechbi.com//MT105025//\">\"US FDAs New Game Plan For Digital Health\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url></p><p>\"I want to make sure we are not only implementing provisions in Cures efficiently and effectively...but we are looking for opportunities to embed other policy priorities,\" he said.</p><p>                                  From the editors of The Gray Sheet                               </p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.filmore@informa.com\">David Filmore</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:danny.al-faruque@informa.com\">Ferdous Al-Faruque</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDINS-MT121576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDINS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PMC-FDF1-F0JS-Y1NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436901</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><timeReceived>6:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medtech Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48260\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 2, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Legal scholars have begun discussing privacy in the narrow context of smart cities, (1) but the topic has yet to penetrate the federalism and localism debates. Our study of privacy in the city demonstrates that as new data-fueled business models emerge in the urban environment, analysis of the legal powers of the city may benefit from insights into the relationship not only among levels of government but also between the private and the public sector. Cities' power or powerlessness is not solely defined by federal and state preemption but might be influenced by a city's general fiscal autonomy (including dependence on federal and state grants), and the policies cities adopt when entering into partnerships with private corporations.</p><p>In contrast to other fields in which U.S. cities lack either the formal authority or actual capacity to govern, (2) the vast majority of cities retain ample legal powers over the collection and use of personal data by city agencies. (3) Nevertheless, they often agree to relinquish powers by outsourcing control to tech companies in exchange for revenue or data, or in the hope of growing their technology sector in the name of innovation, jobs, and prosperity. For example, New York City might not fear state preemption when proposing to amend its administrative code to prohibit the sharing of location data with third parties. (4) However, the same city previously agreed to a deal whereby Sidewalk Labs--part of the Alphabet conglomerate and a sister company of Google--installed Wi-Fi kiosks in downtown Manhattan that used video cameras and Wi-Fi sensors to monitor the movements and activities of passersby with minimal protection of privacy interests. (5)</p><p>Privacy--on city sidewalks, streets, parks, plazas, and in public spaces generally--has emerged as an intrinsically urban value. Social scientists have long emphasized the anonymity of city life and connected it to the diverse social fabric and the freedom of choice that makes big cities appealing. (6) Diversity and tolerance are natural and desirable elements of the urban ethos. According to Jane Jacobs, privacy, as a precondition for both diversity and tolerance, is \"precious in cities. It is indispensable.\" (7) Jacobs continues: \"A good city street neighborhood achieves a marvel of balance between its people's determination to have essential privacy and their simultaneous wishes for differing degrees of contact, enjoyment or help from the people around.\" (8)</p><p>Intrinsic to city design are also public spaces, to which anonymity is inherent and which, as we show, are now increasingly being privatized. Public spaces have a long history as venues for political and ideological engagement. (9) As philosopher Michael Sandel points out, public spaces are \"traditionally sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship, so that people from different walks of life encounter one another and so acquire enough of a shared ... sense of a shared life that we can meaningfully think of one another as citizens in a common venture.\" (10)</p><p>In this Article, we ask whether technology is now changing the conventional wisdom about city life. As cities take on the role of technology testbeds, in ways never seen before, they become sites for ever more intrusive surveillance (in the conventional sense of monitoring behavior, or collecting and analyzing information to influence, manage, or direct behavior) and newer forms of what many refer to as \"datafication,\" which is different from, and less familiar than, \"digitization.\" The latter term refers to the use of computing devices to record, quantify, format, or store data as a series of digits. In contrast, \"datafication\" refers to \"long-term storage in a format that is searchable, computationally manipulable, and [that] may be aggregated with information from other\" sources. (11) Datafication thereby makes it possible for organizations to use data in ways that may have been unanticipated or even technologically infeasible at the time of collection, and are qualitatively different from the original purposes of the collection.</p><p>Cities are \"data-rich environments\" (12) because their large populations generate vast amounts of data as they interact with IoT devices and sensors in public spaces; (13) utilize city services that collect, analyze, and optimize personal data; (14) and encounter the special-purpose technologies deployed by law enforcement to maintain public safety and safeguard citizens against terrorist attacks. (15) This ubiquitous collection of data about all aspects of city living and the near-constant monitoring of public spaces erodes the anonymity of urban living. It also threatens the \"marvel of balance\" (16) between wanted and unwanted interaction with other people and government officials (especially local law enforcement), without which the diversity and tolerance of city life become unsustainable. Further, anonymity is but one aspect of privacy--the advent of big data has seen the emergence of broader concerns intertwined with privacy, such as lack of algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency. Questions inevitably arise as to how best to counteract these trends at the local level. Although we acknowledge the interconnection of the above contexts in which cities are data-rich environments, hereafter, we zoom in on civic uses of data in various cities.</p><p>Importantly, the comprehensive notion of data privacy that we adopt in this Article allows for the conceptualization of data privacy as a lever of both regulation and deregulation. Privacy is instrumentalized for the pursuit of traditional consumer protection and political participation goals that stretch beyond municipal boundaries, making cities participants in nation-wide debates of regulation and deregulation that reverberate across the country and may even have global implications. Rather than the enactment of new legislation, public interest litigation--as an instance of exercising existing city powers--plays a role in these cases. Simultaneously, privacy can also be instrumentalized by private actors --for example, in the sharing economy--that want to avoid regulation of any kind. With this in mind, we consider whether several cities, at the same moment in time, will reach different outcomes when faced with similar policy challenges or converge on policies across the board. We question to what extent the level of privacy protection in the city is dependent on general federal constitutional and statutory frameworks. The Article offers tentative answers by discussing developments in a handful of U.S., Canadian, and European cities.</p><p>Given that privacy is a multifaceted concept, we find that the same cities may protect certain aspects of privacy in some areas while undermining it in others. For example, we see New York City litigating to ban the collection of citizenship data of its population, (17) yet also attempting to acquire from Airbnb, without subpoenas, the personal data of Airbnb hosts. (18) Thus, there are no privacy frontrunners or privacy laggards. Instead, we identify two main roles for data-rich cities: privacy activists and data stewards.</p><p>First, through data privacy activism, cities raise a voice in nation-wide political and consumer protection debates as in the Census 2020, Cambridge Analytica, and Equifax cases. As privacy activists, cities assume a role most closely aligned with a traditional public law institution acting to utilize innovation in the service of citizens. (19) Second, cities act as data stewards when they take steps to govern a new datafied urban space. (20) This role extends from pooling data among city agencies to improve the delivery of services, to managing data-sharing agreements with private actors in discrete contexts (such as ride- or bike-share data), to ceding control over data governance as an element of huge real estate development deals. (21) As privacy stewards, cities may reorient the very understanding of \"public interest\" from privacy protections to open data sharing practices and behave more like commercial actors. Privacy can give way to budgetary concerns exacerbated by federal and state disengagement from the provision of public services, immigration waves, and general urbanization trends. Our case studies suggest that data stewardship is best understood on a spectrum spanning both highly protective intracity data agreements and commercial giveaways, with \"data collaboratives\" (or \"data trusts\") occupying a middle ground. Thus, cities-as-data stewards attempt to regulate their urban environments through data, which may occur at the expense of privacy. Finally, we find that the privatization of public services is morphing into the privatization of public spaces, as data collected in communal areas are co-owned or co-opted by private companies.</p><p>This Article proceeds as follows: Part I situates urban data initiatives and related privacy issues in the context of federalism and localism. Part II examines the city as a privacy activist through the lens of the Census 2020 litigation and lawsuits against major corporations (such as Facebook and Equifax) in which city lawyers led consumer protection lawsuits on behalf of local residents but acted on a national stage. Part III then examines the city as a data steward using detailed case studies about the impact on the privacy of data-sharing agreements among city agencies and commercial agreements with urban innovation firms like Sidewalk Labs or sharing economy firms like Uber or Airbnb. Part III also contrasts instances of data governance arrangements in business-friendly environments, specifically comparing Toronto and Barcelona's efforts to preserve the public interest while embracing smart city concepts. The Article then concludes.</p><p>I. PLACING PRIVACY IN THE FEDERALISM AND LOCALISM DEBATES</p><p>This Part locates privacy and technology within a historical overview of theorizing cities from a legal vantage point: First, it shows how cities are slowly carved out space within American federalism and localism debates. Second, it engages with the most developed account of urban legal theory today--that of Professor Richard Schragger. In the privacy field, the model advanced by Schragger translates into an amalgam of urban privacy activism and data stewardship, as discussed below. (22) In other words, the model likely holds true even beyond the United States, with two caveats: when applied to big, cosmopolitan cities; and to the extent that such cities choose to avail themselves of agglomeration effects and existing legal powers.</p><p>A. From Federal to Local, Urban and Cosmopolitan Values</p><p>The study of big cities often falls in the cracks between federalism and localism. Amid insightful essays on \"Our Federalism,\" (23) \"Our Localism,\" (24) and a carve-out for \"Our Regionalism,\" (25) a take on \"Our Urbanism\" is still missing. Federalism often centers on the relationship between the federal government and the states, while localism examines the relationship between states and localities. Granted, both scholarly work and constitutional doctrine recognize overlaps. Federalism and localism coincide with the values of decentralization: Dean Heather Gerken spells out the normative case for federalism as promoting \"choice, competition, participation, experimentation, and the diffusion of power.\" (26) Professor Richard Briffault convincingly argues that what is true for federalism is even more true for localism, since:</p><p>[T]he [Supreme] Court's conflation of federalism with \"local\" self-governance and accountability to local electorates is noteworthy, and many of the Court's federalism cases actually dealt with local governments. The Court's normative concerns with responsiveness to diverse needs in a heterogeneous society, innovation and experimentation, and citizen involvement in democratic processes apply even more to local governments than to states. (27)</p><p>Professor Schragger goes a step further by demonstrating that as large corporate interests drive state and federal policymakers to converge around a deregulatory agenda, cities--not states--have become the true \"laboratories of democracy\" in the United States, bulwarks of diversity, and engines of normative federalism. (28) Schragger persuasively argues that as economic activity in urban centers increases, cities' ability to experiment with redistributive and regulatory policies is on the rise. (29)</p><p>State and local autonomy have a long association with a conservative agenda, at least since the days of Jim Crow. (30) Especially in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, however, the local has become the new stomping ground for progressives. American cities have formed a sort of bottom-up opposition in a host of policy domains, including campaign finance regulation, (31) \"sanctuary\" for immigrants, (32) environmental protection, (33) and anti-discrimination. (34) Federalism and localism scholars have long noted the trend, but what has gone under the radar is a new area of city initiatives: data privacy.</p><p>Should what is true for all localities and all cities in general--for example, their recently expanded capacity and willingness for regulatory experimentation--apply a fortiori to big cities that, thanks to a sizeable market share, are even better able to offer viable democratic experiments across a range of policies? The role of large U.S. cities in a federal or local constellation of actors is rarely studied separately. (35) No doubt, on these terms, New York City is no different from Tucson, Arizona. Professor Nestor Davidson persuasively shows that questions of legal autonomy across all localities are essential for depolarizing conflict and planting the seeds of legal doctrine, but emphasizes the variety of state constitutions that point to the difficulty of a one-size-fits-all approach. (36) There are a small number of major American cities with their own legal charters--Chicago, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.--that can be singled out because of their sheer size or cultural, technological, or political leadership. We focus our study on these cosmopolitan cities. (37) In seeking to understand the privacy aspects of \"Our Urbanism,\" however, it also makes sense to add to the analysis a snapshot of medium-size and smaller cities located in the interior of the country.</p><p>Further, we attempt to place the U.S. developments within a global perspective by discussing a few foreign cities that have undertaken important smart city and data stewardship experiments--namely, Toronto and Barcelona. (38) The cosmopolitan ambitions of diverse and populous urban centers, like Canada's Toronto, are comparable to those of New York City. In contrast, Barcelona, Spain--a middle-sized city in Europe that struggles for a cosmopolitan flavor --provides an example of an alternative vision of the public sector's engagement with technology firms. Moreover, a federalist and localist framing remains apt for these cities since Toronto is embedded within a federal system, while Barcelona is a part of Spain's highly decentralized government.</p><p>The capacity of big cities for experimentation is arguably stronger than that of smaller cities since, as Schragger points out, agglomeration effects limit the fear of capital flight. (39) He challenges the view of competitive federalists who explain urban ethos with simple convergence around a single deregulatory agenda: in the latter view, cities competing to attract businesses and skilled workers will offer different deregulatory bundles lest capital and skilled labor decide to \"vote with their feet\" and go elsewhere due to more favorable conditions. (40) Instead of sorting, Schragger posits agglomeration as central to urban policy initiatives. In his model, what matters for businesses and skilled workers is access to the right places with the right people--agglomeration results in restricted capital and labor mobility, unlocking, in turn, the potential for democratic experiments on the local level. (41)</p><p>We observe that in the technology arena, Schragger's model may shed more light on urban data initiatives in bigger rather than middle-sized cities. For example, in Louisville, Kentucky, despite the city advancing legal changes at Google's behest to facilitate the installation of Google's high-speed internet service, the company recently pulled out of the medium-sized city. (42) Conversely, despite protests and a pending privacy lawsuit, Sidewalk Labs continued to move ahead on its Quayside smart city project in the larger city of Toronto until the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic led the firm to withdraw from the project. (43) However, the sphere for experimentation that agglomeration opens up for cities is circumscribed by both federal and state law factors such as a general lack of constitutional status for U.S. cities and the very broad ability of states to preempt local laws and policy initiatives. (44) Schragger strongly emphasizes the lasting shift from rural to urban in American demographics that has yet to be encapsulated in law and power distribution. (45) Recently, academic discussions of both federalists and localists zoom in on aggressive new preemption measures enacted in the United States primarily by red states that target blue cities' regulatory experiments. (46) In the data privacy field, however, U.S. cities have fared somewhat better and have successfully regulated both city agency data collection and the purchase and use of surveillance technologies. (47) In fact, cities possess the legal power to do so, and relevant state laws do not preempt them due to what one of the co-authors has described elsewhere as the Fair Information Practice Principles' (FIPPs) gap (meaning that the federal Privacy Act and its state analogs only apply to data collection and use by federal and state agencies, but not by local ones) and the public surveillance gap (meaning that federal surveillance law typically does not limit surveillance in public spaces and city surveillance ordinances have filled in this gap). (48)</p><p>Privacy regulation of the commercial sector is more complicated as the sectoral approach to privacy in U.S. law would mean that localities would need to navigate around federal law governing entire sectors such as credit, healthcare, and finance. (49) Commercial privacy regulation is attempted by a few states--notably in California through the newly enacted California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into force in 2020. (50) The statute is expected to be influential well beyond Californian borders (51) and is already being discussed in congressional hearings that consider proposals for a U.S. federal consumer privacy bill. (52) The CCPA explicitly preempts \"all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws\" adopted at the local level \"regarding the collection and sale of consumers' personal information by a business.\" (53) Thus, local commercial privacy regulation represents another potential gap for local privacy law but a harder one to fill by cities--instead, several U.S. cities have attempted a case-by-case quasi-regulation of the private sector through initiating lawsuits against private companies that mishandle data under state and city consumer protection laws. Despite the controversy in federalist debates over what constitutes the \"local,\" (54) in order to be regulated effectively (in subsidiarity parlance), (55) the credit and finance sectors arguably need national (and perhaps even an international threshold) regulation. In both Spain and Canada, unlike in the United States, a comprehensive statutory framework already regulates commercial privacy at the European level in the European Union (the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) (56) and the federal level in Canada (the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)). (57)</p><p>In sum, U.S. cities' legal powers in the field of privacy are substantial within a few narrow areas. However, in the mismatch between cosmopolitan and other cities' rising economic and societal importance and constrains on their legal and fiscal autonomy--a discrepancy lamented at least since Gerald Frug published his seminal work City Making (58)--preemption is but one aspect on the scale of city power versus powerlessness. Granted, major blue cities in large, blue states in the United States might be seen as the bulwarks of progressive federalism. (59) This is because the preemption of regulation on the state level, although it does occur, (60) is far less disruptive than the overreaching preemption enacted by red states against blue localities that stretches to punitive measures. (61) However, these major blue cities might also face disempowerment based on fiscal constraints.</p><p>B. Cosmopolitan Ambitions versus (Fiscal) Autonomy</p><p>In terms of economic power, not only are cosmopolitan cities responsible for a significant percentage of revenue and taxes in their respective states and the national economy as a whole, but their gross metropolitan product may exceed that of many states. (62) That said, perhaps as a result of municipal giveaways to railroad interests and overspending on other forms of infrastructure in the past, many U.S. states have circumscribed metropolitan revenue-raising even in their largest cities. Dillon's rule--the doctrine restricting local governments' law-making authority only to explicit grants of such power by the state--emerged in the United States and spread throughout Canada amidst various fiscal concerns. (63) Further, progressive reformers of the past century sought to \"limit the capacity for [city] governments to take on debt by entrenching debt limitations into state constitutions.\" (64) The European context is somewhat comparable: European Union-wide austerity measures following the European debt crisis in 2009 led Spain to reverse its prior Keynesian approach resulting in cutbacks on local fiscal autonomy and the enactment of legal measures aimed at general recentralization after 2010. (65) Although most U.S. states have long since replaced Dillon's rule with a broader mandate for local autonomy under home rule, (66) and Canadian cities emancipated themselves around 2005 to obtain certain concessions of autonomy from their provinces, (67) remnants of Dillon's Rule persist in North America in terms of fiscal restraints on local governments. New York, for example, limits the amount raised by taxes on real estate in New York City in any fiscal year to 2.5% of the average full valuation. (68) Similarly, the pendulum has swung back in Spain, where in 2019, the center-left Prime Minister proposed substantial increases in public spending for the region of Catalonia (where Barcelona is located). However, the measure was not approved as Catalonians saw it as an insufficient grant of fiscal autonomy. (69)</p><p>Cities worldwide are experiencing similar problems. A central issue is described as \"offloading\"--an abdication of responsibility on the side of state or federal/central governments from the provision of urban infrastructure coupled with the reduction in federal or state grants for urban centers. (70) Cities are expected to fill in the gap while demands for infrastructure updates and the need for new services are constantly on the rise due to rapid population growth and immigration. In addition to challenges in the availability of affordable housing, poverty levels, traffic congestion, and other transit problems, cities now face new challenges brought by the digital revolution, such as closing the digital divide and boosting urban information infrastructure. Privacy considerations are intrinsically linked to the agglomeration of data, including personally identifiable data, on the local level. Local governments amass data not only as a result of providing the usual municipal services to local citizens (transportation, housing, sanitation, education and libraries, health and social services, and public safety) but also due to their growing embrace of data-driven products and services. Cities worldwide attempt to transform themselves by taking advantage of data analytics, social engagement, and big data. (71) The digital revolution has led to urban investments in information technology (IT) infrastructure as never before with the dual goals of enhancing and improving municipal services (especially social services and policing) (72) and ensuring greater access to technology through broadband initiatives and investments in the local technology workforce. (73) Local financial dependence on private investment to create and maintain such infrastructure results in a special symbiosis with businesses that arguably delineates the outer boundaries of regulatory experimentation on the city level. Local governments can seek to circumvent debt and taxing limitations in many ways, including through licensing and fees. Related to privacy, we see that some cities require data (including personally identifiable information) instead of fees for licensing data-intense services such as ride- or home-share companies like Uber and Airbnb. (74) It is difficult to find direct causation between low levels of fiscal autonomy and attempts for \"data regulation\" instead of direct taxation. It is safe to say, however, that cities worldwide are facing general legal and fiscal constraints relative to their elevated societal and economic status and new responsibilities. Such constraints may dictate decisions cities take to enter into legal arrangements that are favorable to private companies but damaging to privacy.</p><p>Even so, cities are left with plenty of legal ammunition in the privacy field. As in the case of land use planning in the United States, the question is not whether a city has power, but how it chooses to exercise its extensive power. As cities experiment with data-driven services, they are not forced into making concessions to tech giants but may do so simply by agreeing to commercial terms that outsource public functions or disfavor privacy as a matter of choice. One example is New York City's obtaining \"free\" (i.e., ad-funded) technology and telecommunications services for local citizens in the aforementioned \"LinkNYC\" deal with Sidewalk Labs, (75) or requiring non-anonymized data from Airbnb to enforce city housing regulations without imposing tax burdens. (76) Another is Toronto's decision to outsource the development and management of a parcel on its waterfront to Sidewalk Labs without fully addressing the privacy implications of the deal despite the existence, in Canada, of solid federal and provincial privacy laws that Toronto could have used as leverage in their negotiations. (77) This decision was in keeping with Toronto's initial disregard of the long-term impact of the deal on the city's autonomy vis-a-vis a powerful tech company. Such data deals are cut without sufficient deliberation about whether local residents truly wish to exchange privacy and public control over public places for the promise of improved efficiency and greater convenience. (78)</p><p>The symbiosis between city governments and tech companies is mirroring, on the subnational level, the important transformation of law and legal standards that Julie Cohen compellingly traces on the supra-national level. (79) As both businesses and governmental institutions transition from industrial to data-intense, informational capitalist models, U.S. cities exemplify that transition: they function as a hybrid between a public institution seeking to act in the public interest and a business corporation seeking to maximize profits. Interestingly, this trend--that we coin as \"data stewardship\"--co-exists with cities' public litigation efforts that promote privacy--a trend that we call \"privacy activism.\" Public lawyers typically defend their governmental clients when litigation is initiated against them. Yet, as pointed out by the City Attorney of San Francisco, (80) lawyers in a city's law department can also act as civil plaintiffs invoking federal, state, and city law in the public interest. Data activism is an example of just how cities make use of existing powers to expand their sphere of policy experimentation.</p><p>II. THE CITY AS PRIVACY ACTIVIST</p><p>Some of the big, cosmopolitan cities we examine have been active in trying to safeguard privacy-as-political participation in an issue with national ramifications: the 2020 Census citizenship litigation. Others have initiated lawsuits against major firms like Facebook and Equifax for privacy violations affecting local residents. This Part examines cities as privacy activists in both sets of cases.</p><p>A. Data Wars: Privacy and Political Participation</p><p>Data is power. By trying to protect the personal information of their immigrant populations, states and cities are trying to safeguard local autonomy and ensure political participation. As Professor Ilya Somin remarks: \"State and local governments have extensive information about hundreds of millions of people that the federal government could abuse in many ways.\" (81) Such abuse of data could stifle federalism's institutional structure for allowing minorities to take part in governance, what Heather Gerken has called \"the loyal opposition.\" (82) Urban power measured in political representation and the disbursement of state and federal funds depends on cities' population size. But urban population size often correlates with diversity. In terms of demographics, global cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. are homes to very diverse populations, many of whom are immigrants such that lack of privacy about their legal status may result in severe consequences including deportation proceedings. (83) Urban power can, therefore, be indirectly connected to policies favoring the preservation of the data privacy of these vulnerable populations.</p><p>In May 2017, President Trump established the (now defunct) Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. (84) The Commission was supposed to collect a large pool of voter's personal data from election officials in states, including names, addresses, dates of birth, political affiliations, voter histories, criminal records, military status, and partial social security numbers. (85) The government's purported justification--to fight voter fraud via access to state voter registration databases--was seen by many as an ill-masked attempt to restrict voting rights. (86) Forty-four states, including many Republican-led state governments, and the District of Columbia, invoked privacy, among other reasons, to reject some or all of the government's demands. (87) Many of the opposing states filed lawsuits, and civil society organizations also initiated legal actions on privacy grounds under federal law. (88) Finally, the government decided to discontinue the existence of the Commission, citing state resistance and its choice to not \"engage in endless legal battles\"--battles that commentators indicated the administration probably expected to lose. (89) The Election Integrity Commission episode throws in sharp relief the connection between data and power on the one hand, and privacy and local autonomy on the other.</p><p>More recently, the Trump Administration's crackdown on immigration has been countered by local efforts to oppose the federal government's deportation of undocumented immigrants. (90) In turn, the federal government has fought back not only by directly challenging sanctuary cities but also by leveraging new data wars that threaten to curtail local autonomy significantly. (91) We argue that the Census 2020 litigation, in which states and cities were the first to file a case against the Department of Commerce's decision to insert a citizenship question in the 2020 census, is best understood against the backdrop of the administration's attempts to discipline sanctuary jurisdictions.</p><p>i. The Census 2020 Citizenship Question Through the Prism of Sanctuary Cities</p><p>In 2017, California declared itself \"a sanctuary state.\" As a part of its sanctuary policies, the state enacted Senate Bill 54, restricting the range of information state and local governments are allowed to share with federal immigration enforcers, (92) and Assembly Bill 450, prohibiting employers from voluntarily allowing a federal immigration enforcement agent to enter \"nonpublic\" areas of their workplaces or to access, review, or obtain employees' records. (93) In response, the Trump Administration sought to aggressively enforce 8 U.S.C. Section 1373, a federal law mandating that a federal, state, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the (former) Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual. (94) Section 1373 predates the Trump Administration by decades and has been the subject of prior federalism challenges by some of the jurisdictions involved in the citizenship imbroglio. (95) The novelty of the Trump Administration's effort is to legally tie federal enforcement to punitive measures, thereby turning Section 1373 into a grant condition for federal funding of local governments. (96) The Trump Administration also evoked Section 1373 to challenge the legality of California's sanctuary laws; litigation is ongoing. (97) The case has been framed as one about local enforcement of immigration law and federalism. (98) However, these issues closely intersect with privacy, given that the challenged laws attempt to safeguard the personal information of California's immigrant population. Many California cities (including San Francisco) have sided with the state sanctuary policies based on a narrower interpretation of Section 1373.\"</p><p>Several of the cities examined in this Article (New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, and Chicago) have litigated on their own or joined a coalition of states against the government's mandate of cooperation in deporting illegal immigrants as a condition of receiving federal grants to localities. (100) The Census 2020 litigation, in which many sanctuary cities have taken part, is not directly about federalism, much like the sanctuary cities' litigation is not directly about the protection of personal information. No matter the legal framing, however, the context of the litigation in the Census 2020 cases reveals a pattern: for local autonomy to exist, the privacy of national minorities who make up the majority in big urban centers needs to be preserved.</p><p>ii. The Census 2020 Litigation in Focus (101)</p><p>The U.S. Constitution explicitly mandates the government to conduct a census every ten years. (102) The federal government collects census data on all persons residing in the United States, regardless of their legal status, to apportion state representatives to the House of Representatives, to draw political districts and allocate power to them, as well as to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal, state, and local funds. (103) Simultaneously, census data is used for demographic purposes and has habitually included respondents' race, sex, age, and whether they own or rent a home. (104)</p><p>Since 1960, the decennial census questionnaire distributed to all households . . . has excluded a question on citizenship .... The Census Bureau has stated that to ask this question increases the difficulty of counting already \"hard-to-count\" groups--particularly non-citizens and Hispanics--whose members would be less willing to participate for fear that their data could be used against them. (105)</p><p>In March 2018, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that he would add the citizenship question to the Census for 2020 to assist the Department of Justice (DOJ) in enforcing the Voting Rights Act (VRA). (106) Various plaintiffs challenged the decision in court. (107) The plaintiffs included a coalition of 15 states and a number of cities and counties as well as non-governmental organizations that support immigrants. (108) They raised two challenges: first, that the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which prohibits federal agencies from acting in an arbitrary manner; second, that the decision violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it was motivated in part by invidious discrimination against immigrant communities of color. (109)</p><p>Writing for the district court, Judge Furman sided with the plaintiffs, finding that an undercount would translate into a loss of political power and funds for states and localities. (110) The court also found that, in states with large migrant populations (like California and New York), an undercount might result in both the loss of a congressional seat (111) and dilution of the political power of certain cities within their states. (112) In addition, since national census data is also used for a range of municipal purposes, the court accepted as an injury, in fact, New York City's and Chicago's argument for a diversion of resources to counteract the potentially harmful effects of data distortion that inserting a citizenship question to the census might cause. (113) Finally, the court found that the government's stated rationale for restoring the citizenship question--to promote enforcement of the VRA--was pretextual and thus violated the APA. (114) But, the court rejected the claim that the Secretary of Commerce was motivated by invidious discrimination in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. (115) The government then appealed the decision directly to the Supreme Court. (116)</p><p>In a long and divided opinion authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court left in place the injunction blocking the citizenship question from the 2020 Census. (117) Chief Justice Roberts was satisfied with the evidence showing that the reluctance of noncitizen households' to answer the citizenship question would depress census data. (118) This, in turn, would result in a number of injuries--diminishment of political representation, loss of federal funds, overall degradation of census data, and diversion of resources--satisfying the \"injury in fact\" standing requirement. (119) However, the Chief Justice concluded that the Secretary of Commerce was within his discretion to weigh the benefits of completeness and accuracy of census data in favor of completeness and against the recommendation of the Census Bureau. (120) Contrary to what the district court found, uncertainty about the reasons behind underreporting was not unjustified, and the Secretary of Commerce's policymaking discretion did not need to be subordinated to the technocratic expertise of the Bureau. In other words, the Chief Justice found that inserting a citizenship question in the census was a policy choice within the range of reasonable options before the Secretary of Commerce. (121) Despite this partial reversal of the District Court's judgment, the Chief Justice finally affirmed Judge Furman's opinion by stating that there was a \"significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.\" (122)</p><p>If the Trump Administration succeeds in its anti-sanctuary measures, it will assert broad power to impose new conditions on federal grants to state and local governments, thereby suppressing political dissent in these jurisdictions. It is worth questioning the Administration's attempt to achieve the same goal--disempowering its state and city political opponents--by waging data wars. Approximately two weeks after the Supreme Court decision in the census case, President Trump issued an Executive Order establishing \"an interagency working group with a goal of making available to the Department administrative records showing citizenship data for 100 percent of the population.\" (123) The new rationale for this extensive data collection is the identification of those who are eligible for public benefits. The Executive Order continues, \"data identifying citizens will help the Federal Government generate a more reliable count of the unauthorized alien population in the country.\" (124) A subsequent statement describes a recent \"massive influx of illegal immigrants at our southern border,\" states that \"hundreds of thousands of aliens who entered the country illegally have been released into the interior of the United States pending the outcome of their removal proceeding,\" and warns that \"more than 1 million illegal aliens who have been issued final removal orders from immigration judges . . . remain at-large in the United States.\" (125)</p><p>There is a limited constitutional right to information privacy in the United States, (126) and privacy injuries are often insufficient to show standing, let alone sustain a substantive claim. (127) The unresolved constitutional crossover between privacy and antidiscrimination law has a long pedigree that goes back to at least Roe v. Wade (128) and Lawrence v. Texas. (129) Moreover, although the substantive due process might have been eschewed for extracting a right to bodily privacy in Griswold v. Connecticut due to its Lochner-era connotations, (130) due process has resurfaced in relation to information privacy and anti-discrimination concerns in the context of big data. (131) As Justice Breyer wrote in his concurring opinion on the citizenship question, studies by the Census Bureau found that \"Hispanics were significantly more likely than were non-Hispanics to stop answering at the point they reached the citizenship question.\" (132)</p><p>In substance, the Census 2020 litigation is about making available the personal information of vulnerable immigrant populations concentrated in big urban centers to the federal government. The gap in constitutional protection led the justices to decide the case only on administrative law grounds under the APA. That said, the lower court ruling and the Roberts opinion emphasized that the violation of the APA alone was substantial, given the statutory protection of core constitutional and democratic values of accountability. (133) President Trump's Executive Order appears to contemplate the collection of personal data concerning citizenship status for statistical purposes, and the use of citizenship data for determinations about public benefits and possible deportation. (134) It, therefore, seems possible that the census case may return to the Supreme Court to determine again whether the decision to collect data about citizenship is a renewed \"contrivance,\" (135) similar to those evoking election fraud and the enforcement of the VRA. (136)</p><p>B. City Attorneys General as Data Privacy Enforcers</p><p>Cities have litigated against the federal government to preserve the personal information of city dwellers and safeguard diversity, local autonomy, and political participation. They have also fought to protect the public interest against private parties that violate the privacy of their residents. Although state attorneys general (AGs) have a proven track record in privacy enforcement, (137) city AGs are emerging now as new players at the forefront of consumer privacy enforcement. States have their own versions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA), (138) as well as other privacy and consumer protection laws that city AGs can invoke in court either directly or under municipal law. Often, a state's mini-FTCA and related privacy statutes are worded more broadly than their federal counterparts. In addition, the FTC has no immediate fining authority (unless a firm violates the terms of a consent decree), whereas state law permits city AGs to directly claim (not insignificant) civil penalties. (139)</p><p>The cases discussed below are among the first instances in which city AGs use state consumer protection legislation for privacy protection. Importantly, such suits can proceed even if the violating conduct of an online platform or data broker has not taken place beyond the limits of a city's litigation jurisdiction.</p><p>i. District of Columbia v. Facebook</p><p>Facebook has a decade-long track record of privacy failures, but the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal tops them all. (140) As widely reported in the press, (141) Facebook allowed a researcher, Alexander Kogan, to contact Facebook users about downloading a personality quiz application. Around 270,000 users responded. The application collected not only their data but also harvested the information of all their friends, giving access to the profiles of an estimated 50-70 million people. (142) Kogan then sold this information to a company called Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that offered to identify the preferences of voters based on their personality traits, friend networks, and Facebook \"likes\" to influence their behavior with targeted election advertisements. (143) President Trump's 2016 election campaign thereafter hired Cambridge Analytica to gain access to these voter profiles, (144) as did the Brexit campaign. (145) The ensuing scandal gained notoriety precisely because of the number of people affected and the fact that they were voters with political interests, and not merely shoppers with consumer interests. As a result, the public outcry in the Cambridge Analytica scandal has been loud and persistent.</p><p>In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation of the matter premised on Facebook's violation of a 2012 consent decree involving data sharing with third-party applications. Under the consent decree, Facebook agreed, among other stipulations, to give users clear and conspicuous notice and to obtain \"affirmative express consent\" before sharing their data with third parties. (146) Facebook failed to meet this requirement in allowing Kogan to harvest an enormous trove of data and share it with Cambridge Analytica. (147) In July 2019, the FTC imposed a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for violating the 2012 consent decree along with new measures to ensure accountability and transparency. (148) European privacy officials also imposed fines under the then-in-force Data Protection Directive. (149) Despite these actions, civil society organizations like the Electronic Information Privacy Center (EPIC) insisted that privacy regulators must do more to change Facebook's predatory business practices--in particular, arguing that the FTC either failed to follow up on its consent orders or did not do so fast enough. (150) FTC largely leaves tech companies' privacy violations unpunished, revealing a potential enforcement gap. It is this gap that State, and now City, Attorneys are seemingly stepping in to fill.</p><p>As a city-state jurisdiction, the position of Washington, D.C., is unique within the United States. In 2018, before the FTC acted, Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a complaint under the District's Consumer Protection Procedures' Act (CPPA). (151) Racine alleged that Facebook did not meet consumers' reasonable expectations of privacy, including that of more than 340,000 D.C. residents, when it failed to protect their data in the Cambridge Analytica matter. Substantively, the allegations of misrepresentation and lack of reasonable oversight of third-parties' applications in the Racine complaint matched those later raised by the FTC. (152) However, Racine's claim that Facebook needed to notify its users of the unintended use of their data by Cambridge Analytica likely goes a notch further. In terms of remedies, much would depend on what constitutes a single violation under the CPPA. Although the AG had not specified amounts, D.C.'s consumer protection law provides for treble damages or $1500 per violation (whichever is greater), in addition to injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. (153) The AG found the new settlement with Facebook reached by the FTC unsatisfactory and has proceeded further with this litigation. In spite of Facebook's dispute over the D.C. court's jurisdiction, so far, the claim has been allowed to proceed. The D.C. Superior Court asserted that it had jurisdiction since Facebook engaged in continuous and systemic business activities with D.C. residents, acquiring substantial revenue from consumers in the District. (154) Setting aside the question of whether the municipal tier is the right level of regulation when it comes to ensuring privacy protections in the private sector, the example of this case of public interest city litigation, and the one that follows shows that cities are currently flexing their muscle as privacy activists to fill in a perceived regulatory gap.</p><p>ii. San Francisco and Chicago versus Equifax</p><p>Last but not least, in the string of litigation that portrays cities as participants in nation-wide debates, are the data breach cases filed by the City Attorneys of San Francisco (155) and Chicago (156) against Equifax. The firm is among the three largest U.S. credit reporting agencies, and its business consists of amassing extensive personal records, which it sells to third-parties for a range of uses where an individual's creditworthiness determines his or her eligibility for various products and services (for example, consumer credit, insurance, cellphone service, student loans, home purchases, car leases, and so on). (157) Equifax collects and maintains data of 820 million customers worldwide. (158) In 2016 alone, the company reported annual revenue of more than $3.1 billion. (159)</p><p>In 2017, Equifax suffered a major data breach that compromised the personal information of more than 145 million Americans. (160) Both the FTC and the CFPB could have pursued civil penalties for the breach under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and could have immediately pursued civil penalties calculated by experts of up to $48,000 per violation. (161) However, the FTC instead chose to rely on the FTCA, even though the statute does not grant the Commission any immediate fining authority. (162) Almost two years later, Equifax agreed to a settlement that included a still hefty penalty of $575-700 million. (163)</p><p>In terms of injunctive relief, Equifax agreed to a set of extensive measures, including the establishment of a detailed security program over the course of 20 years and reports to the FTC of data incidents, as well as biennial security assessments by a third party. (164) The monetary and injunctive relief was granted based on three legal grounds raised by the FTC. First, the FTC asserted Equifax's failure to apply reasonable measures to secure data in the knowledge of security vulnerabilities. (165) Without showing concrete examples, the Commission pointed out that as a result, the breach led to \"a substantial injury\" to consumers. (166) Second, the company misrepresented its security and privacy policies, misleading consumers about its products. Finally, the company failed to meet its obligations under federal law requiring financial institutions to develop a comprehensive written information security program. (167)</p><p>Although the FTC began investigating the Equifax breach in the fall of 2017, (168) it did not reach a final settlement until the summer of 2019. Within a few months of the breach, however, the San Francisco City Attorney filed the first legal action for privacy breach in the country by a governmental actor. (169) This action raised several claims: first, that the company failed to implement reasonable security measures in violation of the California Customer Records Act (CRA), (170) and that this failure compromised the data of approximately 44% of the U.S. population, including 15 million Californian residents; second, that Equifax exacerbated the risk of identity theft and fraud faced by Californian consumers by delaying notification of the breach until six weeks after the discovery of the breach, in violation of California's breach notification law, which requires expedient notification if personal information is unencrypted or reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person. (171)</p><p>The City Attorney based San Francisco's standing on California's Business and Professional Code, which gives the city the right to enter a suit on behalf of local residents when a company is allegedly conducting \"unlawful, unfair and fraudulent\" business practices within the city. (172) The city met the \"injury in fact\" standard because California residents suffered financial harm from the Equifax breach even though the complaint did not cite any particular injured party. (173) The city sought civil penalties of $2500 for each violation, restitution to Californians who used Equifax's services, and injunctive relief. (174)</p><p>Chicago filed a suit against Equifax under the city's Consumer Fraud, Unfair Competition, or Deceptive Practices Ordinance. (175) The city asserted jurisdiction since the company was conducting unfair and deceptive practices while doing business in Chicago, and the conduct of Equifax resulted in compromising the personal information of 5.4 million residents of Illinois, including an uncounted number of people who resided in Chicago. (176) The Chicago Corporate Counsel raised four claims: First, that Equifax fell short of its public promises to make the protection of personal data its \"top priority.\" (177) Second, it failed to implement security industry best practices (for example, encryption, deployment of available fixes, and patches in the knowledge of security vulnerabilities). (178) Third, it failed to provide timely and full notice of the breach to Chicago residents (in violation of the Illinois Personal Information Privacy Act (PIPA)). (179) And fourth, that Equifax engaged in further unfair and deceptive practices after the breach. (180)</p><p>As in the San Francisco case and that of the federal agencies, Chicago claimed that the Equifax data breach caused potential harm to Chicago residents by exposing them to the risk of identity theft and financial fraud but did not give examples of particular victims and occasions of harm. (181) The Chicago complaint went slightly beyond the San Francisco and federal complaints because Chicago also raised claims of emotional harm to local residents based on lost time, fear, and anxiety. (182)</p><p>The participation of various cities in privacy enforcement actions seeking to protect the public interest reveals certain patterns. First, the cases that they chose to litigate are usually high-profile ones--both the Cambridge Analytica incident and the Equifax breach are prime examples of high-profile cases with significant nation-wide, and even global, impact. Second, the city attorneys (sometimes in concert with the state AGs) are usually the first governmental actor to start litigation, serving as an alarm bell for federal enforcement agencies. Unlike in other expertise-heavy data breach cases where the state AGs participate at the end stages of litigation, leaving the FTC to invest resources into an investigation and then sharing the settlement, (183) in the cases we discuss city law offices are first movers in litigating.</p><p>Although legally speaking, all cases fall within the same title--privacy consumer protection--thematically, they can be divided into two types. In the electoral context, the Cambridge Analytica suit, much like in the context of political representation and local autonomy, the Census 2020 litigation tries to preserve democratic values. (184) The Equifax cases, in turn, are aimed at improving consumer protection standards in data-intense sectors (185) and are based on a broad interpretation of harm that might have triggered or reaffirmed such an interpretation on the federal level. (186) Further, unlike in other areas of law where cities abruptly clash with states trying to preempt city ordinances along party lines, (187) data privacy litigation shows a harmonious city-state relationship of well-resourced, big cities working shoulder-to-shoulder with their states. That dynamic might be exemplary of what Schragger dubs as \"our federalism's anti-urbanism\" or the tendency of U.S.-state based federalism to disfavor decentralization to sub-state governments, and to exert any real-life influence, often cities need to be in synchrony with their states. (188) In this sense, large, cosmopolitan cities' privacy activism in the United States is emerging within progressive states, and opposition seems more likely to come from a conservative federal administration. (189) At least when it comes to enforcement, there seems to be no horizontal city coordination because, unlike with state attorneys general, (190) city attorneys general do not share a venue for collective action.</p><p>Certainly, city litigation with data privacy implications fits neatly into the wider partisan dynamics where local actors serve as checks on federal power through the institutional venue of federalism. (191) As the office of the City Attorney of Chicago remarked:</p><p>It would be correct to say ... that a number of our present initiatives (including but not limited to in the data privacy arena) are driven by a concern that at present the federal government is not taking sufficient action to protect the health, safety, and interests of Chicago residents. (192)</p><p>However, attitudes toward Silicon Valley and concomitant privacy issues vary both across and within party lines, demonstrating the nuances of partisan federalism in this field. (193) Further, unlike with state and city attorneys general, FTC's settlements do not go to the Commission's coffers, but directly to the Federal Treasury. Coupled with the revenue-raising restraints cities face as outlined above, this is possibly creating a depoliticized, purely financial incentive for prosecutors on both the state and the city level to bring actions. Chicago is not dropping its charges at the moment of writing in the wake of the FTC settlement with Equifax, (194) while San Francisco has yet to announce its decision on the matter. (195) The trend shows the crossing of public interest litigation with profit-seeking on the side of city actors.</p><p>III. THE CITY AS DATA STEWARD</p><p>At every level of government--federal, state, and local--government agencies amass personal data and must manage their data assets in the public interest. Cities collect and utilize an extensive range of personal and sensitive data and do so with relatively few encumbrances from superior levels of government. When they act explicitly as data stewards, cities not only carry out day-to-day management tasks but also take on \"fiduciary-like responsibilities to consider the ethical and privacy impacts of particular data activities and to act with the best interests of individuals and society in mind.\" (196) According to Kelsey Finch and Omer Tene, data stewardship consists of a familiar set of data governance and accountability mechanisms. (197) Its five components include first, \"privacy management programs establishing principles and practices that apply to collecting, viewing, storing, sharing, aggregating, analyzing, and using personal data.\" (198) Second, an oversight mechanism for such programs, which minimally requires appointing a designated privacy lead. (199) Third, privacy risk management, which may entail conducting Privacy Impact Assessments as well as a benefit-risk analysis for big data projects that promise tremendous benefits but that also \"introduce new privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with large-scale data collection and analysis.\" (200) Fourth, vendor management--because so many smart city developments depend on public-private partnerships. (201) Fifth, an ethical review processes akin to the rules for conducting human subject research whenever cities allow public or private researchers access to big data. (202) This is especially true if the research involves secondary purposes (i.e., \"appropriating civic data that was originally collected for another purpose without citizens' knowledge or consent\"). (203)</p><p>Cities do not always achieve this ideal of data stewardship. As the case studies below demonstrate, cities must fully embrace their role as data stewards when they process data incidental to delivering city services and share it among city agencies under the terms of interagency data sharing agreements or local privacy regulations. They face greater challenges in protecting data and serving the public interest when they interact with powerful commercial actors motivated by private interests. Nor are the privacy measures cities adopt in commercial interactions uniform across all cases. Privacy measures adopted range from arms-length agreements in which cities bargain away privacy rights in exchange for private firms offering discounted or \"free\" services such as broadband; (204) to ill-conceived regulations forcing sharing economy firms to hand over customer data (which have sparked lawsuits by regulated firms positioning themselves as protecting their customers' privacy interests against the city government); (205) to more collaborative forms of data sharing in which cities and technology platforms experiment with open data or data trusts; (206) and, finally, to more complex and protracted engagements such as the Toronto Quayside project, where government, the private sector, and local citizenry are contesting the very soul of the smart city. (207)</p><p>A. Managing City Data</p><p>A recent trend in urban governance is the delivery of more efficient and effective services via data integration and analysis, a trend that extends to traditional social services. (208) Many families receive services and benefits from multiple public and private programs. Yet, all too often, caseworkers working with the same families are not even aware of one another in part because they maintain their data in siloed databases. Data integration and analysis not only allows caseworkers to coordinate services for clients but also to do a better job of matching individual clients with existing services and improve policy decisions and program development more generally. (209) Integrated social service programs entirely depend on the collection, sharing, and repurposing of highly personal data. (210) They, therefore, require very tight controls over data access, use, disclosure, and retention to avoid gross privacy violations. Proponents of data-driven solutions have viewed privacy rules as a nuisance akin to bureaucracy (211) or acknowledged that local government has responsibility for privacy and security protections but without otherwise giving the topic any further attention. (212) More recently, innovative cities have taken up the privacy challenge by developing standardized data-sharing agreements with strong privacy provisions. New York City is a good example. (213)</p><p>In 2008, the Mayor's Office issued Executive Order 114, launching an initiative to facilitate data integration and exchange among multiple Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies; privacy concerns barely registered beyond requiring that data sharing comply \"with all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations.\" (214) However, participating agencies had to sign an agreement providing for the protection and confidentiality of all data exchanged or accessed by \"HHS-Connect\" systems. (215) The agreement imposed various obligations under the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), which are the basis for modern privacy regulation. (216) Applicable principles included purpose limitations, access rights as determined by the source agency, use restrictions, access controls, and data security, training of personnel, and adherence to citywide IT policies (mainly security and responsible use). (217) Over the next decade, New York City continued to extoll data sharing while demonstrating limited concern for privacy. For example, the city enacted an Open Data Law, mandating that by the end of 2018, the city make freely available, on a single web portal, all \"public\" data sets. (218) It also created the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA), with responsibilities for collaborative, data-driven solutions, a citywide data platform, oversight for data projects, and implementation of the Open Data Law. New York City's inattention to privacy concerns finally changed in November 2017, when the City enacted its first comprehensive privacy laws in the form of two laws designed to protect personal information collected by city employees and contractors in the course of providing local services and benefits. (219)</p><p>New York City has done an excellent job of addressing the privacy issues associated with data integration and analysis, evolving from data-sharing agreements to a local ordinance requiring comprehensive citywide privacy policies and protocols. In its zeal to improve city life by processing and analyzing massive amounts of data, however, the city has been less successful in identifying and correcting issues related to algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency. Over the past five years, both privacy scholars and far-sighted regulators have recognized, in the words of John Podesta, former advisor to President Obama, that \"big data analytics have the potential to eclipse longstanding civil rights protections in how personal information is used in housing, credit, employment, health, education, and the marketplace.\" (220) For example, the use of predictive algorithms to maximize interest in online job postings can lead to ads being \"delivered in a way that reinforces gender and racial stereotypes, even when employers have no such intent.\" (221) Algorithms recognize and, in some cases, reproduce existing patterns in employment, even when those patterns are the result of past discrimination. (222) Thus, while big data analytics can help identify patterns of bias and illegal exclusion, it can also hide continued bias behind a veil of impartial mathematics. (223) This problem can be equally pernicious whether the algorithm in question was designed and implemented by the public or the private sector. (224)</p><p>In some ways, the city's neglect of these issues is not surprising. There is a long history of surveillance and policing of welfare applicants in the United States that predates data analytics. (223) More recently, scholars have identified \"algorithmic discrimination\" as an emergent topic in privacy scholarship and have called attention to both the due process deficits of data analytics and its harmful impact on people of color and other historically marginalized communities. (226) Although the city has taken a preliminary step toward addressing these concerns by appointing a cross-disciplinary group of experts to an Automated Decision Systems Task Force, with the goal of developing a process for reviewing the algorithms the city uses through the lens of equity, fairness, and accountability, (227) the task force is behind in its goal of issuing a report of policy recommendations by Fall 2019. (228) More generally, responding to algorithmic discrimination remains one of the great unfinished tasks of city data governance.</p><p>B. Commercial Data Sharing Agreements</p><p>The preceding Sections suggest that in developing data-driven policies to improve the quality of urban life, cities have all the political power they need to govern the relevant data. In fact, the social service programs that cities hope to improve are mostly funded by federal and state programs that carry their own complex requirements and burdens. Apart from any constraints accompanying such programs, however, cities operate with a very free hand in governing local data. (229) Neither are the city's regulatory powers preempted by federal or state law, given that the federal Privacy Act applies exclusively to personal data held by federal agencies. Most states lack comparable laws regarding state agencies, and the minority states with such laws limit their scope exclusively to state, as opposed to local agencies. (230) When cities enter into commercial agreements with private firms, however, they must contend with the privacy practices and norms of some very large and powerful actors. Moreover, these market forces may exert greater sway over cities than any statutory rules from higher levels of government. This next Section examines commercial interactions with three sectors of great importance to twenty-first-century cities: broadband, the sharing economy, and smart city technology firms, including those engaged in high-profile projects such as Toronto Quayside.</p><p>Broadband, in the form of readily available and inexpensive fiber connections and advanced wireless capability, is increasingly important to economic growth, education, and healthcare. (231) Many cities have recognized that cheap, unlimited communication capacity is essential to the future prospects of their citizens and their community, while at the same time recognizing that a vast digital divide separates rich and poor residents. (232) Cities have therefore made it an explicit policy objective to narrow this digital divide by investing in innovative ways to provide high-speed internet access to homes, businesses, and the public, or even rolling out free, public wireless services. Some of these initiatives have proven ill-advised from a privacy perspective and illustrate the same neglect of privacy issues by cities as in the early days of data-driven city services.</p><p>Unlike the rollout of broadband, where cities try to attract private investment, the sharing economy needs the city as much as the city needs the sharing economy. Data-intense businesses in the sharing economy differ from platforms like Facebook or data brokers like Equifax because they offer \"what might ... be called 'real-world' goods and services,\" such as transportation and housing. (233) Urban density provides a critical mass of providers and consumers \"sufficiently close to each other or to other amenities to make [sharing companies] work.\" (234) Beyond filling in shortages in housing and transportation by freeing up surplus goods, the sharing economy provides another crucial asset for the city: data. The troves of aggregate data amassed by sharing enterprises can improve local government by guiding urban planners toward the optimization of housing or reducing traffic congestion. (235) But the relevant data sharing agreements may--or may not--fully account for privacy costs to local residents. Cities have adopted vastly different approaches to data sharing arrangements with sharing economy firms ranging from intrusive regulations to experiments with data collaboratives.</p><p>\"Smart city\" is a buzzword with no fixed meaning. (236) At the very least, it describes cities permeated by \"software-enabled infrastructures and networked digital devices and sensors that are used to augment urban management and governance.\" (237) At the same time, smart cities are cities where technology-driven innovation and entrepreneurship both attract jobs and investments, and make government work better. (238) Some of the world's largest technology companies operate smart city initiatives combining networking infrastructure, IoT devices, and data-driven analysis. One of these firms, Sidewalk Labs--a division of Alphabet, and sister company of Google, which has an ambitious smart city project underway in Toronto, Ontario--perfectly illustrates the problems that arise when cities allow the private sector to set the agenda for governing the smart city.</p><p>i. Bargaining A way Privacy Rights</p><p>Both major cities and small towns across the country have begun experimenting with public-private partnerships as a way to offer free or low-cost Wi-Fi in public facilities (such as parks, stadiums, or low-income housing), and much faster but more conventionally priced internet access deals to the city's remaining population. Often, private firms receive certain benefits or regulatory concessions from local governments in return. For example, Google inked deals with the mayors of Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, to install \"Google Fiber\" in some government buildings in exchange for using city offices, equipment, and electricity free of charge. Moreover, Google negotiated its way around the \"universal service\" obligations that typically require big telecommunications companies to at least offer their services to an entire city or town. (239) Although Google Fiber originally had a free option, Google eventually canceled and replaced it with a $50 option that offers internet at slower speeds. Google Fiber also partnered with the Housing Authority of the City of Austin to offer free Wi-Fi at select affordable housing providers. (240)</p><p>New York City has launched multiple broadband initiatives ranging from promoting competition in the residential and commercial broadband markets, to investing in networks for the provision of free or low-cost high-speed residential access for low-income communities, (241) to a citywide implementation of digital kiosks called \"LinkNYC\" (which offer high-speed Internet access and a range of other popular services including Wi-Fi phone calls, device charging, and a tablet for access to city services, maps, and directions). (242) In the latter deal, a company called CityBridge agreed to lay cable, install infrastructure, and operate the LinkNYC network \"for free\" in exchange for splitting advertising revenues with the city, valued at $1 billion over the life of the 12-year franchise agreement. (243) One of the major investors in LinkNYC is Sidewalk Labs. (244)</p><p>In Fiber, Susan Crawford describes how companies with monopoly power over broadband and Internet access (mainly Comcast and Verizon) use their tremendous lobbying resources to thwart broadband competition despite the obvious need for massive investments in fiber infrastructure (the so-called \"last mile\" problem). (245) Crawford also highlights a few smaller cities and towns that have invested in community-based broadband to build low-cost, high-speed networks at the local level. Although project financing is always a bit precarious for these communities, they have relied successfully on bonds, federal and state matching grants, and anticipated budgetary savings to build city-owned community fiber networks. These networks are designed to reach all local residents, thereby closing the digital divide and ensuring that the local community is well-positioned to enjoy future economic growth and related innovations in education, health, and local governance. (246)</p><p>There are notable differences between the privacy policies of these smaller, locally operated broadband providers and those of the larger firms seeking huge advertising revenues. For example, a glance at the relevant privacy policies of the towns Crawford highlights shows that their policies regarding the collection and use of data are reasonably protective of local users' privacy interests. (247) And a cursory review of the Spot on Networks (SON) privacy policy at the Queensbridge public housing project shows that not all locally operated broadband relies on targeted ads or sale of personal data to third parties to generate revenue. (248) Rather, it appears that local, and to some extent, federal tax revenues pay for the service. (249) Other large cities, including Boston (250) and Kansas City, (251) have similar programs that benefit low-income housing residents and do not sacrifice their privacy interests.</p><p>In sharp contrast, the ad-funded LinkNYC network raises several serious privacy concerns. The first is that by allowing LinkNYC to collect data from city residents and visitors for advertising purposes, the city government has relinquished its data stewardship role by trading away New Yorkers' privacy for LinkNYC's \"free\" services. According to privacy advocates, the original CityBridge privacy policy governing the use of LinkNYC kiosks \"allowed nearly limitless retention of user data, including browsing history.\" (252) Although CityBridge modified its privacy policy in response to these and other objections, (253) the updated policy still allows the system to track and retain \"information such as IP addresses, anonymized MAC addresses, device type, device identifiers, and more, for up to 60 days\" without users' consent. (254) A LinkNYC FAQ offers users various reassurances on these points, (255) but critics remain skeptical, noting that it is relatively easy to re-identify anonymized and aggregated information, that LinkNYC kiosks are equipped with Bluetooth beacons that have not been activated yet but may someday be used to push location-based mobile ads to passersby devices (even if they have not registered as Link users), and that Google has a prior history of Wi-Fi sniffing (the Google Street View case) (256) and of circumventing the anti-tracking protections built into Apple iPhones (the Safari case). (257)</p><p>The second concern is that the LinkNYC deal increases the risk of security breaches and unwanted surveillance of users and passersby. LinkNYC requires users to register with an email address and agree to allow CityBridge to gain access to their web traffic. (258) The kiosks also contain video cameras that capture a 360-degree view of the surrounding streets and sidewalks. (259) The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) has argued that the sheer volume of information these devices gather \"will create a massive database of information that will present attractive opportunities for hackers and for law enforcement surveillance, and will carry an undue risk of abuse, misuse and unauthorized access.\" (260)</p><p>A third concern (to which we return below) (261) is that LinkNYC is but the first stage in Alphabet/Sidewalk Lab's plans to extend the monetization of personal data from the online world to the physical landscape. Indeed, during a 2016 talk about reimagining cities, Dan Doctoroff, the founder and CEO of Sidewalk Labs and former deputy mayor under Michael Bloomberg, stated as much:</p><p>By having access to the browsing activity of people who are using the Wi-Fi--all anonymized and aggregated--we can actually then target ads to people in proximity and then obviously over time track them through lots of different things, like beacons and location services, as well as their browsing activity. So in effect what we're doing is replicating the digital experience in physical space. (262)</p><p>The root cause of the privacy threats associated with LinkNYC is that New York City issued a design challenge without privacy requirements or much regard for preserving existing urban privacy on the streets of New York at all. Arguably, the city could have leveraged the worth of its extremely valuable sidewalk real estate by driving a hard bargain that both delivered a public Wi-Fi system with minimal impact on the city budget and protected New Yorkers' privacy rights from the get-go. Instead, the city traded its citizens' rights to a for-profit company deeply immersed in the surveillance economy. (263) Ironically, it is not even clear that LinkNYC helped the city achieve its goal of reducing the digital divide. As it happens, Sidewalk Labs located the LinkNYC kiosks mainly in high traffic touristy areas of Manhattan (which generate the highest advertising revenues) rather than in poorer residential neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. (264) Of course, at the end of the day, LinkNYC and its boosters can always fall back on the argument that those who object to the kiosks are welcome not to use them. But this is a false dichotomy based on an illusory choice. What it really amounts to is forcing citizens to comply with the (private) terms and conditions of their own surveillance or to stay off the (public) streets. As Nick Pinto points out, \"there is a different issue at play here: the right of the City of New York to surrender [citizens'] data for us[.]\" (265)</p><p>ii. Coercing Data Sharing in the Sharing Economy</p><p>At first glance, one might expect cities to encourage data-driven companies of the sharing economy to operate in their territory: above all, the shared economy epitomizes the cosmopolitan spirit, innovation, and modernity. As Daniel Rach and David Schleicher note, \"the presence of bike-or car-or home-sharing services conveys something important about how progressive, how technologically advanced, and indeed how 'world class' a city is.\" (266) Presence does not necessarily mean the lack of any regulation, however. (267) When cities interact with data-intense companies to design their urban spaces, the quest to improve municipal services, whether well-intended or catering to the incumbent industry's interests, (268) may leave them indifferent to privacy issues.</p><p>New York City offers several case studies of privacy-related tensions between the city government and the sharing economy. For example, New York City's powerful Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has long required ride-hailing firms to provide the agency with information such as pick-up times and locations, license plate numbers, and base information. In May 2016, however, the TLC issued a \"driver fatigue rule\" that additionally required such firms (including Uber, its competitors, and other for-hire vehicles like black limos) to share more granular information, including the duration and destinations of drivers' trips. (269) Uber objected on both privacy and trade-secret grounds and even tried to avoid the rule by releasing a free tool allowing cities and developers to track car travel times. (270) Uber based its objections in part on a prior slip up in which the TLC released a dataset that contained identifiable information about yellow taxi trips, allowing civic hackers to deanonymize the released data and, by combining it with paparazzi photos of celebrities, figure out exactly which restaurants they visited and whether they added a tip to their taxi fare. (271) Despite these concerns, the TLC proceeded with the new rule and, to the delight of city transportation planners, as of February 1, 2019, ride-share companies must provide the TLC with \"the date, time, and location of pickups and drop-offs (at least down to the intersection), the vehicle's license number, the trip mileage, itemized trip fare, route (including whether the vehicle entered traffic-choked Midtown), and how much the driver was paid.\" (272)</p><p>In demanding this information, the TLC showed a near-perfect disregard for data stewardship. As Albert Gidari noted:</p><p>The Commission conducted no privacy impact assessment; considered no alternatives with lesser privacy impacts; and failed to inform the public how long it would keep the data, with what other government agencies it would share it and for what purposes, or to whom it would disclose it such as in response to public records act requests or for commercial use. The Commission has no privacy officer and no privacy policy to govern its conduct. It is accountable to no one. (273)</p><p>New York City regulators have also taken an aggressive stance toward collecting data from home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, which enable hosts to list their apartments for short-term rentals. Worried about the impact of removing these apartments from the long-term rental market, the availability of affordable housing and the deterioration in residential peace and quiet from a constant stream of visitors, the New York City Council enacted a ban on short-term apartment rentals in residential buildings with three or more units. (274) This law proved hard to enforce for the obvious reason that the Airbnb website \"does not display the real names and addresses of its hosts,\" making it extremely difficult for enforcement agencies to \"access a comprehensive list of Airbnb hosts in the city.\" (275) In the face of pervasive disregard of this law by Airbnb hosts, (276) the City Council then passed Local Law 146, requiring home-sharing firms to turn over voluminous monthly data regarding the rental activity of their customers (\"hosts\"); this included both personally identifying information and financial data and imposed large penalties on firms that failed to comply. (277) Airbnb and its competitor HomeAway then filed suit against the city seeking to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance on two main grounds: first, that the ordinance violated the Fourth Amendment by compelling them to turn over protected business records without any opportunity for pre-compliance review before a neutral decisionmaker; and, second, that it conflicted with (and is preempted by) the Stored Communications Act (SCA) by requiring home-sharing platforms to divulge information about customers without a subpoena or other legal process as required by the SCA. (278) The Southern District of New York court granted their request for a preliminary injunction, finding that the large scale collection of private business records \"unsupported by individualized suspicion or any tailored justification\" fails to qualify as a reasonable search and seizure. (279)</p><p>In reaching its decision, the Southern District court relied heavily on the Supreme Court's judgment in Pate/ v. Los Angeles, in which a Los Angeles ordinance was found facially invalid under the Fourth Amendment for requiring hotel operators to record, maintain and make available for inspection by the police certain personal information about guests. (280) The court reasoned that just like a hotel, a home-sharing platform has two strong reasons to keep host and guest data private. One is competitive; the other involves the promotion of better customer relations. (281) The court also rejected the city's argument that the platforms' privacy interests in their customers' records were diminished due to the permissiveness of \"administrative searches\" in other industries. (282) Since the hotel industry does not involve inherently dangerous operations, the court was reluctant to extend precedents from more regulated industries to the present context. (283) After finding the ordinance within the scope of the Fourth Amendment, the court then analyzed whether the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard was met. The court reasoned that under the Fourth Amendment, administrative searches of commercial establishments required individualized suspicion for the search and an opportunity for a pre-compliance review before a neutral decisionmaker. (284) It concluded that:</p><p>In its sweep, the Ordinance dwarfs that of the Los Angeles ordinance at issue in Patel. The universality of the [New York City] Ordinance's monthly production demand (covering all short-term rentals in New York City), the sheer volume of guest records implicated, and the Ordinance's infinite time horizon all disfavour the Ordinance when evaluated for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. (285)</p><p>In addition to these privacy concerns, this approach is also an example of Richard Schragger's emphasis on agglomeration effects, which are more likely to occur in big cities. Instead of choosing to leave New York City for less regulated markets, Airbnb decided to stay and invest in a legal battle. Conversely, a few years back, Uber and Lyft chose to leave Austin, Texas, when the city introduced fingerprint-based background checks and other data reporting requirements on all hail-riding drivers in the city. (286) Uber and Lyft only returned--to the detriment of a locally grown alternative non-profit ride-share--when Texas overrode Austin's effort, passing a regulation requiring licensing of the service against a fee on the state level. (287) Disempowered by legal constraints on regulating their urban spaces, cities sometimes turn to data regulation--with varying degrees of privacy intrusion. (288)</p><p>After reviewing the current Airbnb litigation, this Article now turns to more collaborative forms of data sharing between cities and tech firms, focusing on a privacy-friendly-model spearheaded in Seattle.</p><p>iii. Collaborative Data Trusts</p><p>New York City resorted to a government data grab to gain access to ride- and home-sharing data from industry leaders. But other cities have followed a different path. For example, in January 2015, Uber agreed to provide Boston with \"anonymous data about the duration, general locations, and times of rides that start or end in the city\" on a quarterly basis. (289) A year later, Boston city officials expressed some frustration at both Uber's refusal to allow data sharing with a regional planning agency and the utility for planning purposes of the underlying data. (290) In a nutshell, data sets limited to trips' start and end locations by zip codes did not allow \"for analysis of how proximity to public transit affects Uber usage, or how a new building affects transportation patterns.\" (291) Where cooperative partnerships have had the most success to date is in the bike-sharing industry. Both New York City and Boston worked out arrangements with the operators of Citi Bike and Blue Bike, respectively, to make some ride data publicly available subject to a data license agreement that imposes a number of privacy-related restrictions. (292) Seattle has taken an even more innovative approach to cooperative data sharing. A proper analysis of the Seattle approach requires some background information on data trusts and their potential use in balancing the competing interests of cities, sharing economy firms, and local citizens and customers.</p><p>Data trusts are intended to create a fiduciary relationship between a trustee and a beneficiary, such that the former is under a duty to act for the benefit of the latter according to the particular terms of the trust. (293) For example, a group of Fitbit and Apple Watch users might agree to pool their medical data in a data trust with explicit terms for how the trustee may share the data for medical research purposes--subject to various limitations set out in advance, and to the trustee's independent judgment of which uses uphold the interests of the users. The benefits of such a trust structure are threefold. First, in the typical scenario in today's digital world, data controllers amass huge amounts of data about data subjects who have limited understanding of how controllers may use their data and almost no power to avoid unwanted or harmful uses. (294) In sharp contrast, the legal structure of a data trust guarantees that trustees manage beneficiaries' data according to the terms of the trust and subject to a legally enforceable fiduciary obligation. (295) Second, whereas data controllers seek to maximize the value of the personal data they collect for the benefit of shareholders, trustees owe a duty of undivided loyalty, requiring them to maintain their independence from profit-maximizing activities. (296) Finally, trust instruments are highly flexible and therefore allow a wide variety of data sharing policies, thereby providing data subjects a range of choices that reflect their own values and needs in a given context. (297) That said, a trust structure has certain disadvantages, including daunting implementation challenges. Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence identify two issues requiring special attention: uptake (i.e., how to educate potential users about the benefits of data trusts) and exit procedures (i.e., how to identify all data associated with a user wishing to leave a data trust). (298)</p><p>A 2016 article by internet scholars Jack Balkin and Jonathan Zittrain popularized the idea of imposing a general fiduciary duty on service providers like Google, Facebook, and Uber. (299) Their argument turns on a provocative analogy between doctors, lawyers, and accountants, who are required by law to act in good faith towards their clients, and firms in the information industry that supposedly have many of the trappings of fiduciaries. The main shortcoming of their analysis is that it offers no compelling arguments as to why such firms would agree to assume fiduciary duties on a voluntary basis. (300) Of course, this problem is surmountable if Congress or state legislatures enact appropriate legislation imposing such duties on information-intensive firms. (301) Otherwise, the idea of information fiduciaries seems like a non-starter for the private sector.</p><p>But this is not the case for city governments. Despite the mixed reception of data trusts in the scholarly literature, (302) a few cities have proactively partnered with universities to develop trust-based infrastructures for managing sharing economy data in the public interest. One major difference between these efforts and earlier discussions of data trust is that instead of relying solely on the legal structure of trust to achieve their goals, city-university partnerships are adopting a techno-legal approach that incorporates sophisticated technical infrastructure for ensuring the protection of data deposited in the trust repository.</p><p>For example, in July 2017, Seattle began implementing a pilot program for \"dockless-bikes\" under which bike-share operators had two options for sharing granular data about their riders with the city: they may provide the city with anonymized trip information as specified in Seattle's Bike Share Permit Requirements, or they may share data under a signed agreement with the Transportation Data Collaborative (TDC) located at the University of Washington (UW). (303) The TDC is a protected and linked data repository of sensitive information from regional public and private transportation providers. It allows partnering agencies to create data-driven policy, support research uses, and provide individuals with authenticated access to their own transportation records. (304) More specifically, the TDC provides:</p><p>* Policies and protocols that address data ownership, access, use, and related privacy and ethics in the interest of partner organizations and the persons represented by the data, supported by the UW's Urban Infrastructure Lab;</p><p>* A neutral third-party host with transportation expertise (the Washington State Transportation Center (TRAC)) to enable data sharing and analysis;</p><p>* Protection from disclosure under the Washington Public Records Act via administrative, legal, and legislative efforts available to the UW; and</p><p>* A trusted data platform, which provides privacy and security tools, such as encryption for sensitive attributes, data tagging to track and audit the uses and users of data, and policy-based encryption.</p><p>A recent paper co-authored by TDC staff members at UW makes a case for data collaboratives by observing that researchers and the public are very poorly served by the usual dichotomy between open (publicly available) and closed (proprietary) data systems. (306) Institutions are reluctant to make \"sensitive\" data openly available to researchers mainly on privacy and IP grounds, and therefore restrict access to such data or its linkage with other data sets, thereby instead sharing less interesting and useful information with the research community. As seen above, this tension is apparent in the transportation sector, where city agencies want more granular access to firm data than ride-hailing and bike-share firms wish to supply. Building on their work in creating the TDC, the co-authors describe the design of a \"legal-technical infrastructure\" they call Collaborative Data Trusts (CDTs), which they offer as an alternative to the open versus closed data dichotomy. (307)</p><p>One important way in which the UW data trust achieves privacy goals is by relying on differential privacy and synthetic datasets, which allow for the responsible use of sensitive data by removing causal relationships between variables (basically adding noise to prevent re-identification) while preserving relationships in all other cases (thereby preserving utility). (308) The use of customized synthetic datasets also allows researchers to remove signals that could expose proprietary data (and hence competitive advantage for the data providers) or preserve biases that could reinforce discriminatory policies. (309) Finally, the integrated techno-legal infrastructure utilizes data sharing and use agreements to specify in advance the data to be shared, the scope of research, and the legal recourse of the data trust if data quality is deficient and of the data sources in the event of unauthorized disclosure. (310) Data trusts hold enormous promise for cities engaged in data management activities. They enable city governments to maintain their role as data stewards while benefiting from data-driven activities, even as they interact with the private sector in a highly collaborative manner. (311)</p><p>iv. From Data Sharing to Toronto's Outsourcing of Data Governance</p><p>The largest and most controversial smart city project in which data trusts play a prominent role is Sidewalk Lab's efforts to build a smart city of the future in Toronto. (312) In the spring of 2017, Waterfront Toronto (WT), a Canadian redevelopment agency established in 2002 by the government of Canada, the government of Ontario, and the city of Toronto to oversee the revitalization of Toronto's eastern waterfront, issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Quayside Development project. (313) It sought an \"Innovation and Funding Partner\" to help create and fund \"a globally-significant community that will showcase advanced technologies, building materials, sustainable practices[,] and innovative business models that demonstrate pragmatic solutions toward climate-positive urban development.\" (314) Six weeks later--a rather short time for an RFP of such complexity--WT selected Sidewalk Labs. (315)</p><p>In the fall of 2017, WT and Sidewalk Labs signed a Framework Agreement for what many now referred to as the \"Sidewalk Toronto\" project. This agreement generated criticism and controversy mostly due to the secrecy over the full agreement. Only a summary was ever published, and it failed to clarify key terms and concepts regarding data ownership and digital governance. (316) Over the next year, Sidewalk Labs took the lead in convening an advisory board and holding public consultations with very limited participation by any city officials. (317) But prominent privacy experts eventually resigned from their role as company consultants or advisory board members. (318)</p><p>With this background in mind, the remainder of this Section examines Sidewalk Labs' original data governance and privacy proposal for Sidewalk Toronto as set out in its Master Innovation and Development Plan, a three-volume, 1500-page document issued in June 2019. (319) In a chapter devoted to \"Digital Innovation,\" the firm proposed the creation of an independent \"trust\" with broad authority over data governance issues within both Quayside and the much larger adjacent site that Sidewalk Labs refers to in toto as the \"IDEA District.\" (320) In a nutshell, the proposed Urban Data Trust (UDT) would establish privacy guidelines and a related assessment process administered by its Chief Data Officer who reviews and approves projects using data collected in the physical environment of the IDEA District.</p><p>In developing a \"trusted process for responsible data use,\" Sidewalk Labs sought to respond to three concerns raised during the public consultations: first, that data collection in the public realm amounted to a form of surveillance; second, that the collection and use of such data should be treated as a public resource (provided privacy risks have been addressed) and not solely benefit the private or public sector; and, third, that Sidewalk Labs should not enjoy any special advantages in developing the core digital services for the IDEA District. (321) The company sought to address these concerns by creating a new category of \"urban data\" (defined as \"information gathered in the city's public realm, its publicly accessible spaces, and even some private buildings\") (322) and giving it additional privacy protections by treating urban data as a \"collective\" asset that would not be owned \"in the traditional sense\" but rather managed by an independent entity (the UDT) and made publicly accessible by default; and applying consistent processes and guidelines to all entities collecting urban data in the district including Sidewalk Labs. While this strategy sounds reasonable at first glance, it suffers from many shortcomings. The most severe among them is a democratic deficit or lack of political legitimacy.</p><p>To begin with, the RFP called upon the partner to work closely with WT in creating \"the required governance constructs to stimulate the growth of an urban innovation cluster, including legal frameworks (e.g., Intellectual Property, privacy, data sharing)[.]\" (323) As many commentators have observed, it is highly problematic for a vendor \"to propose the structure, operation, and regulatory power\" of the governing entity with authority over the vendor. (324) WT should have set the governance rules for data collected in public spaces that it owned and controlled instead of allowing the proverbial fox to guard the henhouse.</p><p>A lack of legitimacy also undermines Sidewalk Lab's conception of a data trust. According to the MIDP, the final agreement between WT and Sidewalk Labs would set up the structure of the UDT and authorize the creation of a non-profit entity with \"the charter to address the digital governance challenges related to urban data while also promoting data-driven innovations that benefit individuals and society.\" (325) This oversight entity would have a five-member board (drawn from various sectors) and a Chief Data Officer (CDO) responsible for developing the UDT charter, promulgating \"Responsible Data Use (RDU) Guidelines,\" and structuring oversight and review processes. Subject to the oversight board's approval, the CDO would also determine how the entity would be staffed, operated, funded, and perform various other tasks. (326) Although Sidewalk Labs offers a number of ideas for ensuring the board's independence and avoiding conflicts of interest, it is silent as to the basics of governance such as who appoints board members, their qualifications and the necessary expertise in relation to their defined tasks, the board's procedures for handling complaints about the CDO's policy decisions, or their powers of enforcement. Additionally, it has very little to say about the sources of funding for the UDT or what happens if, down the road, Sidewalk Labs walks away from the project.</p><p>This lack of legitimacy has two probable consequences for Sidewalk Labs' data governance proposal. First, although the RDU Guidelines incorporate well-established privacy principles and outline an RDU Assessment process covering any collection or use of urban data, (327) it is not at all clear how the CDO will handle the difficult choices he or she will likely encounter. For example, will the CDO balance risks and benefits in the public or corporate interest? As Sean McDonald notes, \"[t]he Urban Data Trust is likely to have to weather a significant amount of political and financial pressures, which is a challenge for any institution--let alone one trying to maintain the public's interest in data governance amidst financial dependence.\" (328) This suggests that the UDT will have to draw on its political capital to maintain its independence, but in reality, it will have very little capital to draw upon.</p><p>Second, this democratic deficit leaves Sidewalk Labs in a weak position to mitigate any controversies resulting from its creation of a new category of urban data. The company asserts that it heard public concerns over the collection of such data and responded by laying out the guidelines and assessment process described above. (329) Absent from this response is any discussion of simply restricting the collection of urban data or strengthening Canadian privacy law. (330) Unsurprisingly, critics have dismissed the very notion of urban data as \"an elaborate contortion aimed at giving Sidewalk Labs the regulatory cover it needs to collect data without consent in public places that it quasi-owns.\" (331) Nor does Sidewalk Labs allay these concerns by emphasizing open standards and open data. To its credit, the company offers a plan to ensure a digitally open city. This plan is laudable, yet it seems disingenuous given that Sidewalk Labs already enjoys advantages that few other companies can ever match, even if Quayside achieves the status of a digitally open city. These include deep expertise with collecting and using urban data, ownership interests or investments in other companies that have already developed many of the tools needed to make Quayside successful, (332) and access to the financial resources and technical sophistication of its multibillion-dollar sister firm, Google.</p><p>Following the release of the MIDP, the chair of WT issued an open letter identifying concerns with the size, scope, and funding of Sidewalk Labs proposal, and seeking additional information on data governance issues. (333) On October 31, 2019, the chair released a second open letter announcing that the parties had reached \"alignment\" on these and other \"threshold issues\" based on Sidewalk Labs confirmation that it would scale back the proposal from the 190-acre IDEA District to the original 12-acre Quayside site; switch to a new, WT-led approach to data governance based on existing Canadian privacy law; partner with other real estate developers rather than act as lead developer and modify its revenue-sharing plans with WT; and make various other concessions. (334)</p><p>The WT letter emphasizes that this compromise does not represent a final agreement. Rather, it allows WT to proceed with the formal evaluation of the MIDP subject to further public consultation and assessment with a final decision anticipated by March 31, 2020. As to data governance and privacy issues, Sidewalk Labs agreed that going forward, WT will act as the lead on any future discussions with governmental entities; comply with all existing and future privacy legislation, regulations, and policy framework; accept that relevant municipal provisions and federal laws will determine data governance; store all personal information collected in its digital operations within Canada; and not use \"Urban Data\" as a term and otherwise eliminate the UDT from its proposal. (335) As required by the agreement on threshold issues, Sidewalk Labs very recently delivered a Digital Innovation Appendix (DIA) that updates the MIDP and will become the basis for formal evaluation of the project. (336)</p><p>In short, it is too soon to say how the Sidewalk Toronto project will play out or even if it will move forward to the building stage. (337) Still, we can speculate about why it shaped up the way it has. Richard Schragger has described a market-based theory of local government whose two key features--dependence on private investment and competition for private investment with other municipalities--results in \"development and business-friendly policies.\" (338) Something along these lines is no doubt at work with WT, a redevelopment agency nearing the end of its mandate and its funding and lacking the ability to borrow money. In Sidewalk Labs, WT found an ideal partner, at least at the outset. From Alphabet's point of view, Sidewalk Toronto was the opportunity it had been looking for to build a city \"from 'the Internet up.'\" \"What I mean by that,\" writes Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff, \"is a place where ubiquitous connectivity is truly built into the foundation of the city, and where people use the data that's generated to enhance quality of life.\" (339) In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff portrays the marriage between development-favoring cities and the information industry somewhat differently. For Zuboff, the industry's relentless drive for new sources of data leads inevitably to the \"real\" world, and hence to the city as one of the few remaining virgin tracts for data extraction and monetization. \"Whether what even . . . Doctoroff . . . refers to as a 'Google city' succeeds,\" Zuboff notes, \"the company has interested the public by recasting our central gathering places as a commercial operation in which once public-assets and functions are reborn as the cornered raw materials earmarked for a new marketplace.\" (340)</p><p>In sum, the above case studies establish that cities vary widely in their attitudes towards data stewardship and their dedication of resources to building out programs that include all five components identified by Finch and Tene (in brief, adoption of privacy principles, the appointment of a privacy lead, risk management, vendor management and ethical review of AI programs). (341) Moreover, some cities are quite inconsistent in their privacy awareness, depending on their desired goals. For example, New York City's local laws protecting personal data held by city agencies is a model of data stewardship with its strong embrace of privacy principles and internal management programs using a risk-based approach. In sharp contrast, the LinkNYC broadband initiative allows a private firm to set the terms of engagement. While it may succeed in generating high revenues for the city while providing Wi-Fi access to a small number of residents, it scores a failing grade on all five components. Similarly, New York City wanted and got sharing economy data from the likes of Uber and Airbnb by relying on aggressive rulemaking that sparked lawsuits. But in the process, it almost completely disregarded data stewardship. Seattle and several other cities have experimented with alternative approaches to data stewardship by embracing the idea of data trusts, with Seattle demonstrating leadership by developing both the technical and legal aspects of such trusts. Finally, Toronto--a complex and ongoing saga of privacy in the smart city--offered a plan that matched up very nicely with the five components, in the sense that it checked every box. Toronto's government, however, had to fall on its sword and withdraw much of its proposed plan when it became clear that the citizens of Toronto would not stand for a private firm setting its own rules for governing data in public (or quasi-public) spaces.</p><p>IV. THE RHETORIC OF BARCELONA: THE PROMISE OF A \"PUBLIC\" SMART CITY</p><p>Critics of smart city solutions have pointed to the neoliberal turn around which municipalities have started to converge worldwide. The heart of the criticism goes into the very framing of the smart city concept, dominated by a logic of inevitability and an aura of a self-evidently progressive project. (342) Can we reimagine the relationship between technology companies and cities in which technology is used for the benefit of citizens instead of big companies? In which Sidewalk Labs does not use the data from Quayside simply to perfect its AI but to build digital solutions that promote citizen participation, help personalize services, and de-bureaucratize national and local governments, all the while preserving privacy and creating a more enjoyable local environment that stimulates growth? A Spanish city in Europe--Barcelona--is now branding itself as the alternative smart city, one in which the municipality retains control over critical urban infrastructure and services.</p><p>Francisco Franco's dictatorship in Spain in the 1940s-50s epitomized centralism. Thereafter, the resurgent Basque and Catalan nationalist movements were appeased with accentuating regionalism in the 1978 Spanish Constitution--a move toward \"non-institutional federalism\" that was based on the territorial division of the country into 17 autonomous communities. (343) By 2012, half of the Spanish state spending was managed at a regional and municipal level, whilst these two tiers of government also employed 70% of all state employees. (344) Municipal governments were given wide responsibilities in areas as broad as land use, public utilities, sport, transportation, and even childcare. (345) Total local public expenditure tripled during the years of economic expansion, that is, between 1993 and 2009. (346) However, after a pan-European financial crisis, in 2010, the Spanish model of deep decentralization came under severe pressure. The initial reaction to the 2009 financial crisis of the Spanish government was to draw up an expansionist program of [euro]25 billion. The program, known as \"Plan E,\" involved funding projects that were to be carried out by local governments, including small to medium investments in infrastructure and other specific policies like technological development. However, in May 2010, the central government adopted a strict economic stability package in close adherence to the criteria laid down by the European economic authorities. This program sought to cut public debt from 9.2% of GDP in 2010 to just 3% by 2013 and incorporated a wide range of austerity measures that hit especially hard the local governments in Spain. (347)</p><p>It is against this background that in 2015 Barcelona--the capital of Catalonia and the second-largest city in the country--elected a mayor with a radically progressive agenda centered around the principle of data sovereignty. Ada Colau ran her first election campaign with slogans on the re-municipalization of water and energy, social housing, and promises about turning Barcelona into a commons-based digital city built from the bottom-up. (348) The Mayor's Committee on Digital Innovation came up with a Digital Plan, putting emphasis on data ownership by the city, open-source code, and the publication of a technology procurement handbook that specifies contractual clauses mandating ethical standards--fostering a culture of transparency that encourages whistleblowers against corruption and crowdsourcing of ideas for dealing with urban problems. (349) Francesca Bria, Barcelona's Chief Digital Officer, has been called \"the Robin Hood of data.\" (350) Bria is also heading a European-funded pilot project called DECODE (Decentralised Citizen-Owned Data Ecosystems). (351)</p><p>Although privacy and data protection are enshrined as separate human rights both on the level of European law (352) and in the Spanish Constitution, (353) they have not been central to Barcelona's vision of data sovereignty. The newly enacted European statutory framework that could potentially challenge the commodification of data--the GDPR--allows the processing of personal data only when under a legitimate basis. Furthermore, smart city business models that rely on consent as a default legal basis (such as LinkNYC or Quayside to some extent) may run into trouble given the high bar the GDPR places on establishing that consent is valid. (354) For example, most recently, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO)--the country's antitrust watchdog--partnered with data protection authorities in other European countries to raise a legal challenge against Facebook for abuse of its dominant position. The FCO claimed that the all-embracing consent sought from Facebook users for the collection of their personal data through third-party websites and applications that are embedded in Facebook's interface (e.g., through its \"Like,\" \"Share,\" and \"Login\" buttons) did not meet the criteria for informed consent because users were not made aware of the extent of Facebook's data-sharing practices. (355) Moreover, in 2019 on data protection grounds alone, in France, Google was fined [euro]50 million for breaching the GDPR requirements of \"informed,\" \"specific,\" and \"unambiguous\" consent in providing personalized advertisements. (356) At a recent conference, however, instead of referring to the GDPR, Bria emphasized the advent of blockchain technology for ensuring the privacy of Barcelona's residents who contribute their personal data to the city's data commons. (357) The statement chimes in with recent academic interpretations that place blockchain technology outside the scope of the GDPR. (358) Future reliance on blockchain for the rollout of smart city applications in Europe might thus mean that, in spite of its differentiating rhetoric, the \"European\" data stewardship model exemplified by Barcelona is, in fact, steadily converging with North American data practices in the urban context.</p><p>In many ways, Europe and North America \"remain two worlds apart because of their very different understandings of the role that the public and the private sector should play in society.\" (359) Since Europeans place their trust in the public sector, a narrative centered around public data ownership seems intuitively appealing to European sensitivities, and in Spain, it was also embedded into the discourse of local anti-austerity opposition. However, in June 2019, Barcelona's Mayor Colau was very narrowly reelected, and it remains to be seen to what extent she can keep up with her bold electoral promises and go beyond the rhetoric of Barcelona as a \"neoliberal city with a human face.\" (360) The idea of advancing public interest goals through procurement seems well-intentioned, although achieving purely public ownership of data generated through the use of devices supplied by private companies might prove difficult. Moreover, much like the synchronized action of state and city actors in the United States that has a better chance of achieving regulatory experimentation, the interlocking nature of Spain's \"non-institutional\" federalism makes coordination and close cooperation between the regional, provincial and municipal level essential. With independence and nationalist demands (mostly in rural Catalonia but increasingly spreading also in Barcelona) (361) clashing with the urban agenda of Colau, the actual outcome of the data sovereignty brand remains unsure.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Urbanization is here to stay, and so is the growing interest in the City. Jane Jacob's evergreen account of organic urban development remains relevant in the era of technology-driven datafication: \"[C]ities may fairly be called natural economic generators of diversity and natural economic incubators of new enterprises[.]\" (362) Privacy, broadly conceptualized, becomes an intrinsic part of a global city's identity as it intersects with the social capital that characterizes big cities--diversity and economic growth. This Article has sought to blend insights from the literature on global cities, American federalism, and localism studies, as well as on smart cities and privacy scholarship to show that U.S. cosmopolitan urbanism intersects privacy activism with data stewardship.</p><p>First, cities use their legal arsenal to litigate under federal, state, or city law in order to protect the personal information of their city dwellers in a variety of contexts ranging from political participation to consumer protection. Regardless of whether such experiments turn out to be successful--and they sometimes may well be (363)--cities' privacy activism, likely amplified by the stance of their states, may serve as a trigger for bipartisan policy debates and a catalyst for enforcement. Second, regarding technology's courtship with the city, privacy may be respected to a certain degree by local agencies, but privacy concerns increasingly give way to open data practices worldwide. Privacy is also not a priority in emerging new business models that monetize data and are facilitated through contract law. But big cities can and should leverage their existing powers to push hard for privacy-by-design in public procurement projects that may jumpstart the market in privacy-preserving \"smart\" systems. Yet what we observe across the board in large, cosmopolitan North American cities is a tendency toward data stewardship with a wide spectrum of approaches.</p><p>As data stewards, cities sometimes abdicate public power and control over public spaces, behaving more like a commercial actor. Toronto's Quayside project is a harbinger of what we might be seeing more often, albeit to a varying degree, across U.S. cities and elsewhere. Surely the very nature of public spaces--open and accessible to all, without a fee, without government restriction on speech and assembly other than reasonable time, place, manner restrictions, available for community and not privately owned--seems to dictate that public authorities should oversee public spaces. As we have seen, however, instead of relying on their police powers as regulators of local-level broadband, housing, and transportation services, some city governments either negotiate data-sharing agreements that may bring them direct revenues or try to deal with street-level problems through collecting ever more data. Privacy issues in such cases need to be treated with caution and, in any case, with an eye toward greater proportionality. On the one hand, regulation through data cannot be left unchecked against the Constitution. On the other, it would be unwise to see the Fourth Amendment take a Lochner-like turn much like the First Amendment arguably has done. (364) In Europe, conversely, a different cultural understanding of the role of the public over the private sector seems to be the defining factor for the relationship between cities and technology firms. To some extent, the robust privacy framework enacted at a higher level of government (otherwise present in Canada as well), but mostly the entrenched conviction of preference for public ownership over public spaces, drives rhetoric on data sovereignty spearheaded by Barcelona. However, since technology firms can gain control over a public infrastructure not only through procurement but also over the duration of projects, it remains to be seen whether the promise of Barcelona for a publicly structured smart city will remain merely rhetorical.</p><p>Finally, consistent with the ideal of local autonomy and assuming cities can exceed a certain constitutionally protected threshold of privacy interests, cities may choose where to locate themselves on the sliding scale between privacy activism and data stewardship. Will we see citizens instead of businesses \"vote with their feet,\" (365) choosing to live in cities with less privacy but more autonomous cars and security cameras? Or will the trend of local politicking and the predominance of Voice over Exit (366) signal that more frequent local mobilization can change policies, as with San Franciscans, which recently banned the use of facial recognition by the local police force in their city, (367) or what may soon occur in Toronto? Changes might be underway.</p><p>Ira S.

See, e.g., KWAME APPIAH, COSMOPOLITANISM: ETHICS IN A WORLD OF STRANGERS (2007); ULRICH BECK, COSMOPOLITAN VISION (2006). In the context of our study, the cosmopolitan can be broadly linked to city communities of diverse, often immigrant populations that in spite of racial, religious, or other differences try to arrive at a common understanding of the good life, including on the place of technology, innovation, and privacy in it. In a similar vein, Jeremy Waldron suggests that the \"cosmopolitan\" can be understood as an attitude, lifestyle, and a way of constructing an identity for oneself that is different from devotion or immersion in a particular culture.

As digital citizens, it's our responsibility to keep track of the issues that matter - writes Nayef Al-Rodhan. When the newly appointed European Commissioners officially take up their posts on 1stNovember, some very important technology policy questions will once again come into view. </p><p>These are decisions that could fundamentally reshape the business models of Big Tech firms, redraw the landscape of competition and affirm Europe as the dominant global rule maker when it comes powerful tech companies and the effects they have on our politics and culture. It indispensable that we keep checks on technological progress. Human innovation is advancing at breakneck speeds. Things we never dreamed of are becoming reality, such as synthetic biology, bioinformatics, cognitive enhancement, genetic engineering, 3D and 4D printing, Artificial intelligence, automated weapon systems, invisibility cloaks, quantum computing and even neuromorphic computing. Along with their obvious massive potential, these advancements also pose significant risks to social stability, equality, human dignity, free will, national and global security, and even to the very survival of our species. How can we make sure that these constantly evolving technological innovations don't destroy humanity or exacerbate inequalities and privacy intrusions? Emerging technologies offer states more instruments and means for control and surveillance, often infringing on civil liberties. The balance between States' need to know in the name of security and the respect for privacy must be pursued more fervently. Also non-state actors like large multi-national corporate entities that collect massive amounts of personal data, need to be better regulated. We must balance the dizzying potentials of technological advancements with security and ethical concerns, and move from risks to regulations. This must also include mechanisms for overseeing the overseers - or 'regulating the regulators', so it is equally important that we are aware of the powers that be when it comesto regulating the global landscape. Their ambition must be to promote my previously published governance-based 9 dignity needs[1]- which include: reason, security, human rights, accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness, and balance them with the 3 human nature attributes :emotionality, amorality and egoism -without stifling innovation. In the race to regulate Big Tech, it has in recent years become overwhelmingly clear that the first mover becomes the primary global rule maker. The group of policymakers first able to put forward a vision of regulation at global level has an evident advantage - enabling them to pressure other regulatory bodies into embracing their rules, even when contrary to their domestic agendas. With a large market of 500 million citizens, the majority of whom are comparatively wealthy on a global scale, and equipped with the ability to coordinate action on controversial issues such as privacy, competition, and digital tax, the EU has established itself as the world's regulatory pacesetter. In these spheres, the EU has projected itself onto the global stage with particular force in the last year and a half, by advancing its regulatory prerogatives within the agendas of international forums such as the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Crucially, Brussels is emerging as the most important formulator of antitrust regulation. Earlier this year, European officials published a report which pushed for regulators to more heavily scrutinize proposed takeovers based on how companies used data. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's highly interventionist competition commissioner, who has launched several high profile cases against Google, Amazon and Apple, has been reappointed to her role for an unprecedented second term. So the trend that has been set in motion on these issues is looking likely to continue, if not grow stronger. She has already recently warned Silicon Valley that she will move beyond fines during her second term and look at other measures to ensure a fair playing field. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming head of the EU's executive arm, has hinted at new laws on artificial intelligence and the use of big data within 100 days of taking office next month. She and her team are also reportedly considering creating a dedicated multibillion-euro fund to support and promote the European technology sector. As digital consumers around the globe continue to pay closer attention to their relationships with companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 whose users number in the billions worldwide \u2014 it seems inevitable that one region needs to begin taking the lead in debating and implementing appropriate forms of regulation. Effective decision-making by the next Commission, undertaken with the aim of defending basic rights while energising digital markets through the principles of fairness and competition could have the potential to revolutionise the digital economy - bringing about a world in which there are many more winners, rather than a small number of companies whose established advantages skew the market in favour of monopolies. What remains to be seen is whether these difficult but necessary questions will be tackled head on, or conveniently avoided.

Key points: Facebook says the consumer watchdog misunderstands the relationship between news and social media It says if Australia requires it to pay for local news content, it will block all news from its Australian users The Government says the proposed laws are necessary to level the playing field between publishers and tech giants  Facebook has issued the threat in response to a proposed law that would see Facebook and Google forced to pay Australian media organisations for hosting their content.   \"Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,\" a statement from Facebook 's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton said.   \"This is not our first choice \u2014 it is our last.   \"But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.\"   Mr Easton took aim at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which developed the draft code, accusing it of ignoring the role social media played in promoting journalism.   He argued that in the first five months of 2020, users had clicked on Australian news items shared on the platform 2.3 billion times, which the company said generated $200 million in revenue for Australian media organisations.  Crushed: Digital giants vs Australian media  Within a couple of years the likes of Google and Facebook will devour more than half local ad revenues, leaving only crumbs for traditional media players.  Read more  \"When crafting this new legislation, the commission overseeing the process ignored important facts, most critically the relationship between the news media and social media and which one benefits most from the other,\" Mr Easton said.   \"News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.\"   It is understood Facebook is still working through how any news ban would be implemented.   Facebook has also updated its terms of service, which come into effect next month.   Under the changes, Facebook would reserve the right to block information that could lead to \"regulatory impacts\" on it.   \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  Facebook 'heavy handed', 'misconceived'  In response, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused Facebook of making \"heavy-handed threats\" in an attempt to get its way.   \"Australia makes laws that advance our national interest. We don't respond to coercion or heavy-handed threats wherever they come from,\" he said.   \"Our reforms to digital platforms are world leading and follow a ground-breaking 18-month inquiry by the ACCC.   \"These reforms will help to create a more sustainable media landscape and see payment for original content.\"   Mr Frydenberg's language was echoed by his Cabinet colleague, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, who said the views of all parties would be considered as the code was developed.   In a statement, ACCC chair Rod Sims labelled Facebook's intervention \"misconceived\", arguing many Australians relied on Facebook to deliver news for them.   \"Facebook's threat today to prevent any sharing of news on its services in Australia is ill-timed and misconceived,\" he said.   \"The draft media bargaining code aims to ensure Australian news businesses, including independent, community and regional media, can get a seat at the table for fair negotiations with Facebook and Google.   \"We note that according to the University of Canberra's 2020 Digital News Report, 39 per cent of Australians use Facebook for general news, and 49 per cent use Facebook for news about COVID-19.\"  Code sparks ire of tech giants  Google has already launched a strong opposition campaign to the laws, pushing an open letter onto its users .   In the letter, Google argues its free services in Australia, such as its search engine and YouTube, could be under threat.   The media has long argued companies such as Facebook and Google benefit from the work of journalists, without paying for access to those stories or sharing any advertising revenue from their platforms.   The Government says its proposed laws are essential for creating a level playing field between local media and big internet companies.   Google has also reacted fiercely against the proposal. ( Unsplash: Mitchell Luo )  Under the laws, Facebook and Google would be forced to negotiate payments with Australian media companies for their content.   If no agreement can be reached, they could be forced into an arrangement.   The code would also require Google and Facebook to give advance notice of any changes to their algorithms that could impact how news content was displayed.   It would also set a standard for how Google and Facebook shared data relating to how users accessed news content.   The ACCC had lashed out at claims made by Google it would have to start charging for its services, arguing that would only be as a result of the company's own choices.   It also denied suggestions tech companies would be forced to hand over user data to media companies.   Labor's communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland said the Government needed to develop a \"workable\" proposal as it drafted legislation.   \"Australia's news media needs a workable code to support the sustainability of public interest journalism,\" she said.   \"It is the Morrison Government's responsibility to land a workable code. The range of concerns held by all stakeholders demands a credible response from the Government.\"   Public consultation on the code closed on Friday, with the Government now considering the feedback.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42971077523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-4YX1-JCSC-J0WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABC Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Recently, they have even realised that it's necessary. But if there is one thing that has split tech behemoths, politicians and the public apart more than perhaps any other issue, it's what that regulation should look like.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the UK government thinks it has alighted on an answer, offering perhaps the first comprehensive attempt to limit the harm that technology companies are doing to the people - in particular the children - who use them.</p><p>For the most part, the solution they have chosen focuses on shifting the responsibility for content that appears on the site onto the people who run them. It heralds the introduction of a statutory duty of care, requiring that technology companies delete harmful content, for instance, and can be punished if they don't.</p><p>It follows a series of tragic cases in which technology appeared to be implicated, and which turned even more attention to the lack of progress on regulating the technology that runs the world around us. Chief among those awful stories was the suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who had been found to have been looking at content about depression and self-harm - relatively readily available on the platform - before she died.</p><p>The most eye-catching of the proposals, and the one that strays away from expectations, was the suggestion from the government that it will pursue ways of holding individual members of senior management to account when the companies they run make mistakes. Technology firms have often been opaque in their responses to such criticism, and shifting responsibility to individuals could stop them from deflecting towards the immense scale of the products, their organisations and the technologies that underpin them.</p><p>But this approach has proven difficult before. When the DCMS's committee on fake news attempted to question Mark Zuckerberg, he repeatedly turned them down - even after various other countries banded together with UK politicians, and amid speculation about imprisonment in Big Ben's tower for refusing to comply with the select committee's request.</p><p>It neatly illustrated how difficult it can be for a technology company to be regulated by any one government. Facebook has a bigger population than almost any country on Earth a corporate flexibility that allows it to move to just about any country too, allowing it to slip away from politicians in the countries where it doesn't reside, and threaten those in places it does with the possibility it might leave.</p><p>It has traditionally been said that the most obvious place to regulate technology companies is in the US, and it is possible that is the only way for such regulation to have any meaningful effect. Even that has changed recently, however, with Donald Trump focusing on Google and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren offering a variety of policies - including suggestions the big tech companies should be broken up. Facebook knows that regulation is coming, and in recent months has moved towards recognising that it needs to do what it can to influence what that regulation might look like rather than trying to stop it from happening at all..</p><p>And European regulation has been effective before. Only last year, the European Union introduced GDPR - sweeping data protection regulation that applied to any company who stores the data of European users, with the punishment of vast fines for anyone who refuses to abide by it. Whether it was a success is still an open question, but there can be no doubt about its effectiveness, with just about every organisation in the world making major changes to how they deal with data.</p><p>Plenty of questions remain about the government's new proposals, and exactly how they will work. Though the white paper marks the end of a considerable amount of work by the Home Office and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, it is really only the opening salvo of a fight that is going to rage for years, in unknown ways.</p><p>Some of the questions still to be answered are practical, such as whether the government should establish a new regulator or use an existing one such as Ofcom. Some are more political or philosophical, like whether such restrictions are going to lead to a crackdown on free speech and what they say about the responsibility that users must surely take for the posts they make and the websites they use.</p><p>But probably the most pressing ones are somewhere between the two. What does it mean for a government to regulate websites with far more users than it has citizens, and is it really possible for legislation in one country to restrain companies that connect the entire world?</p><p>Whatever the answers to those questions are, they must be asked and we are going to have to do our best to answer them. Governments are under increasing pressure to regulate tech firms and those few tech firms are taking up a more and more outsized role in our lives; this kind of regulation is about nothing less important than the very core of how we live our lives.</p><p>For years, it has been agreed that something must be done about the tech firms, but not what that is. Now the government has made an argument for what should be done - but we still don't know what it actually will be.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000031640479-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV3-CCS1-F072-43BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Your mother would urgently call your dad into the house with the entreaty: \"Telephone. Long distance!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those last two words changed the equation. Your father would drop everything and sprint into the house because long distance calls were very expensive and the caller paid by the minute.</p><p> American Telephone and Telegraph was the one and only carrier at the time and could effectively charge what it wanted for phone service. Your parents seldom complained, because the ability to talk with someone on an opposite coast was still pretty remarkable to them, and any price for this miracle seemed like a bargain.</p><p> It did not seem like a bargain to the Nixon Justice Department. It seemed like a monopoly, and in 1974, the government began the process of breaking up AT&amp;T. In the negotiations that followed, AT&amp;T was allowed to keep its long-distance service, but had to divest its local phone service into seven regional companies known as the Baby Bells.</p><p>AT&amp;T did win what it believed to be a lucrative concession that allowed its subsidiary, Western Electric, into the computer business \u2014 something it had been prohibited from doing by an antitrust suit back in the 1950s. And the government believed that consumers would be the big winner as the monolithic company that controlled almost every aspect of phone communications was broken to pieces.</p><p> The breakup became final the first day of 1984. You can be excused if the date does not particularly stick in your mind. As Congress toys with the idea of breaking up monopolistic tech companies such as Facebook and Google, it might consider the outcome of the country's last great exercise on trust busting.</p><p> The outcome was minimal. Long distance rates did come down, but local bills \u2014 no longer enjoying economies of scale \u2014 went up. AT&amp;T's foray into computers was a disaster, as anyone who was stupid enough to invest in something called Lucent Technologies can tell you. (Hi there.)</p><p> But the real news was that two months before the breakup became effective, Ameritech, which would become one of the Baby Bells, unveiled a blocky gizmo known as the Motorola DynaTAC, which cost $10,000 in today's dollars \u2014 a device more commonly known today as the cellular phone.</p><p> At roughly the same time protocols were being developed that would allow voice to be transmitted over a military communication system that would go on to be called the internet. \"Long distance\" would soon be meaningless.</p><p> It is true that some companies, such as Sprint and MCI, were able to get off the ground because the government's breakup of AT&amp;T cleared a path. AT&amp;T was eventually swallowed up by one of the Baby Bells, which hung on to the name for old times' sake.</p><p> As much as we rightfully champion private enterprise, companies often profit handsomely off of government research, innovation and infrastructure \u2014 then those very same companies squeal like stuck pigs when the very same government tries to regulate their business.</p><p> But breaking up monopolies is tricky business because the future is unknowable, and technology and tastes are ever changing. If Teddy Roosevelt hadn't busted the railroad trusts, the internal combustion engine would have.</p><p> It's certainly easy to get worked up about Big Tech. Facebook very well might be responsible for allowing our Russian enemies to choose an American president. YouTube and Twitter fan the flames of hate and Amazon has destroyed both the corner bookstore and the department stores that used to anchor the shopping malls.</p><p> But it's worth considering that tech as we think of it today is still a baby. It suffered its terrible twos in the dot-com bubble of 20 years ago, when companies incorporated and went public without so much as a business plan. Ten years ago, dropped phone calls were still a common occurrence, and today major security breaches seem to happen once a month. We have no idea how everything tech related, from social media to search engines, is going to play out.</p><p> And finally, we have to wonder if Congress is up to the job. It has already been bought by carriers that put their profits ahead of net neutrality, and we all remember a U.S. senator incredulously asking how Facebook made money.</p><p> As our parents were with the phone, we are with tech; we are so amazed at what it can do that we do not question how it's done. Government intervention might at some point become necessary, but as we've seen through history, technology is pretty good at breaking up itself.</p><p> Tim Rowland is a Herald-Mail columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-9732b0103b349f902b903db56528969748bc15f3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9M-59H1-DXVP-V404-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I agree with Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook chief executive has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">called for more government regulation of the internet</url>. And what he has said is pretty sensible, if a little light on detail. The four areas Zuckerberg wants governments to regulate more are harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. I know what you're thinking: isn't Zuck just passing the buck? Hasn't his company very publicly failed to tackle all of the issues he's saying it's up to governments to fix? You're not wrong. The four areas he's concerned about do happen to overlap with recent Facebook scandals. But that doesn't mean his announcement isn't good news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big companies hardly ever call for more regulation. It sometimes feels as if people in Silicon Valley view laws and, indeed, nation states, as some quaint 20th-century tech that will disappear in a few years, like CDs or fax machines. Businesses such as Uber and Facebook pride themselves on being \"disruptors\", arguing the existing rules are too outdated to apply to them at all. And until now they haven't been keen on any new rules to replace the old ones. The change of heart should be welcomed.</p><p>The culture of disruption within big tech firms regardless of consequences is as much of a problem as their size</p><p>But the devil, as ever, is in the detail. One of the big challenges facing governments around the world is not whether to regulate social media companies such as Facebook, but how to. If you're like me and the internet has given you the attention span of a four-year-old child, you're already bored. But ultimately no regulation of tech giants will work unless users are involved. And that's why we have to engage in this debate.</p><p>I shouldn't need to remind you how high the stakes are. On 15 March the Christchurch shootings <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">were livestreamed on Facebook</url>. Terrorists can now use the internet as a recruiting ground and propaganda arm. Young people like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">Molly Russell</url> (who killed herself in November 2017) are shown content about self-harm on sites like Pinterest and Instagram while they sit in their bedrooms at night. As many as 87 million people's data may have been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">shared illegally with Cambridge Analytica</url>.</p><p>Removing ourselves from these platforms is no longer a realistic option. Companies like Facebook aren't just a bit of fun, they are an integral part of life for millions of people. The internet at its best connects and empowers: it is worth fighting for. But the way companies operate has not been under enough scrutiny until recently. Facebook has committed to creating an independent body to review its moderation decisions, nicknamed the Facebook supreme court. If it is to function properly, the court of public opinion will be equally important in holding social media giants to account. If we are concerned about online harassment we can, and should, report incidents to Facebook. But we also need to raise our voices by, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">signing Level Up's petition calling on Facebook</url> to rethink how it keeps women safe online.</p><p>The bad news is there is no magic wand that will keep the best parts of the internet and get rid of the worst. We can't leave it to politicians to regulate companies like Facebook. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">Zuckerberg's article</url> talks a lot about prohibition of content. It's encouraging to see sites like Facebook banning white supremacist and white nationalist accounts. But we can't just police people and ideas we don't like off the internet. There will always be somewhere else online for them to go. So while it's right for mainstream sites like Facebook and YouTube to moderate content, removing people's platforms to say harmful things is only part of the solution.</p><p>Think of Facebook as a bit like Ryanair or British Airways. If I get on a plane and the man sat next to me gets drunk and tries to grope me, I can file a police report when we land. But while we're in the air, my best bet is that the cabin crew and other passengers will deal with the problem. There are things that airlines can do to reduce the likelihood of that man behaving badly on a flight. There are rules that should be in place if he does. But Ryanair is not responsible for drunk and handsy men, just as Facebook and Google aren't responsible for racism and terrorism.</p><p>That's why we should be wary of anyone claiming it's as simple as deactivating people's accounts. That might be part of the solution - much like removing people from flights - but the authorities have to take online behaviour seriously, and punish it with the full force of the law. If the laws as they currently stand can't cope with the shift to virtual spaces, then they'll need to be rewritten for the digital age.</p><p>There is a reasonable chance the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are too big to regulate. Which is why politicians like US senator Elizabeth Warren <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47762091\">have suggested we break them up</url> into smaller pieces. Warren wants us to curb the power of big tech by splitting up Apple's platform from its app store and forbidding Amazon from owning food retailer Whole Foods Market and shoe store Zappos. Her proposal would stop future mergers of tech firms and might mean Facebook would be forced to sell the competitors it has bought (such as Instagram and WhatsApp). It's an eye-catching idea, but it's narrowly focused on making companies like Facebook and Google less profitable, rather than making them do less harm. The culture of disruption within big tech firms regardless of consequences is as much of a problem as their size. And changing that requires us to use our power as consumers alongside action from regulators.</p><p>We cannot sit back and wait for government to solve this any more than we can expect Zuckerberg to. Wider society must play its part and apply the pressure needed so that those in power uphold - and change -the law when it comes to big tech and its responsibilities to us all.</p><p> Carys Afoko is the executive director and co-founder of Level Up, a community for feminists who want to work together to end sexism</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52765845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSN-X771-JCJY-G4RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><timeReceived>5:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p> Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.</p><p> Trump is meeting with a group of Republican attorneys general at the White House on Wednesday to discuss \u201cprotecting consumers from social media abuses.\u201d</p><p> Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p> Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.</p><p> Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.</p><p> \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p> Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action \u2014 and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.</p><p> Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.</p><p> The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.</p><p> The company based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.</p><p> A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.</p><p> Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.</p><p>Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. GPS navigation system Waze and Nest, offering \u201csmart home\u201d devices, also are in the Google stable.</p><p> Most of the money comes from a digital ad market that Google dominates along with rival Facebook. Google is the bigger of the two online ad giants, thanks mostly to the ubiquitous search platform. Many smaller advertisers have complained that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it\u2019s become a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-4983052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E0FF8CAB62B7C MONTCH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-R921-JBCN-42XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In my mind, there are two things that are low hanging fruit to discuss regarding a modern antitrust environment. Should the Definition and Circumstances Change?I think it is clear from recent news, and communications from the DOJ and the FTC that they are attempting to modernize what is understood as antitrust or anticompetitive behavior and no longer is market share a defining element. </p><p>For those interested I highly recommend reading[1] this article in full which is the speech of Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference.  When listening questions fielded to CEO's or executives lately on whether they feel they are a monopoly, they have often used their market share as a defense. Small market share is simply no longer a defense in this new era, and instead, the conversation will shift to two areas, competition, and consumer harm.  This is essentially how Makan Delrahim states the purpose of antitrust and the core question in this line of his speech 'Therefore, the right question is whether a defined market is competitive. That is the province of the antitrust laws.' Essentially all discussion going forward should be centered around this topic if a market is competitive and if any incumbents are abusing their leverage to keep stifle competition or innovation in some cases.  On this topic of both a re-orienting our understanding of antitrust in the digital era, and competitive market dynamics, I found these following points from Makan's speech quite interesting: Finally, the Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low. It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.  Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero. As the journalist, Franklin Foer recently said, euro;oelig;Who can complain about the price that Google is charging you? Or who can complain about Amazoneuro;trade;s prices; they are simply lower than the competitioneuro;trade;s.euro; Harm to innovation is also an important dimension of competition that can have far-reaching effects. Consider, for example, a product that never reaches the market or is withdrawn from the market due to an unlawful acquisition. The antitrust laws should protect the competition that would be lost in that scenario as well. If you follow executive commentary, you note that price has also been something mentioned as monopoly defense. Apple was quick to point out that 80% of apps on the App Store are free, or Amazon points out that they are generally the most competitive on prices and are working tirelessly to keep prices low. It is abundantly clear price is also no longer a defense against monopoly. This speech makes it clear the issue at hand is not Apple's pricing per se but that there are only two app stores. While competition is alive and well, arguably, on the App Store, App Store competition itself is not alive and well. The digital era is one of the conglomerates. There is no way around that truth, and in this era, it seems, antitrust initiatives will focus more on how said tech conglomerates use their leverage to stifle competition. This opens the door, in my opinion, to a more crucial and better competitive analysis to emerge. In particular, for many companies themselves, who I have felt for some time, have worked closely with their legal teams to get as close to the edge of antitrust behavior without crossing it. Many companies may need to rethink some of their long-term strategies in light of a much larger magnifying glass being placed on them going forward.  Correlation, Causation, and HypocrisyA few other observations on this matter. In this speech, one of the more interesting viewpoints used was one looking historically at antitrust pursuits and remedies as a matter of causation. For example, Makan says about Microsoft 'Although Microsoft was not broken up into smaller companies, the governmenteuro;trade;s successful monopolization case against Microsoft may very well have paved the way for companies like Google, Yahoo, and Apple to enter with their own desktop and mobile products.'  Note the language 'may very well have.' Most of in the industry who have studied it for a long time can say with a high degree of certainty the antitrust suit against Microsoft was absolutely not the reason Google or Apple saw success in their mobile operating systems. The danger of the governments view here is to read too much into past successful antitrust legislation and view it as an anecdote for other successes today. That discounts a vast number of other dynamics that led to other companies successes.  As we build out thinking around how companies have been operating, and more specifically using their leverage, I do think areas of collusion and exclusivity are worthwhile areas for antitrust regulators to take a deeper look at some companies. That being said, I did find it ironic that when it came to collusion, the following example was used: The Antitrust Division may look askance at coordinated conduct that creates or enhances market power. Consider, for example, the Antitrust Divisioneuro;trade;s investigation of Yahoo! and Googleeuro;trade;s advertising agreement in 2008. The companies entered into an agreement that would have enabled Yahoo! to replace a significant portion of its own internet search advertisements with advertisements sold by Google. The Antitrust Divisioneuro;trade;s investigation determined that the agreement, if implemented, would have harmed the markets for internet search advertising and internet search syndication where the companies accounted for over 90 percent of each market, respectively. The agreement was abandoned after the Antitrust Division informed the companies that it intended to file a lawsuit to block the implementation of the agreement. Here again, something that seemed well intentioned may be a factor in hurting Yahoo more than helping since Yahoo has since faded into irrelevance and leaving us in the west with really only one search engine. Yahoo working with Google may have helped them prolong their life long enough to come up with something new or innovate. We will never know. The point remains regulation runs the risk of having the exact opposite of its intentions, and sadly, most of these regulators are not informed enough to play out all scenarios as a part of their decision-making process.  Furthermore, it seems odd the level of hypocrisy antitrust regulators have shown up to this point. Think about things like cable monopolies who had zero innovation, high prices, very little competition in specific regions. Banking is another area, that while it seems like customers have a choice, there has been very little innovation, terrible customer experience, high fees, and a range of things that government regulations have enabled which makes the barrier of entry often too high for many startups.  As I said at the beginning, sometimes regulation is helpful, but more often than not, especially in the digital era, I think it can be argued it has done more harm than good.  That being said, I'm glad the government will start taking a look at certain issues, however, I worry they are ill-equipped to do so in many areas, and my fear is too much overstepping in a way that ends up hurting competition, consumers, and innovation in unintended ways.

We worry that this attempt at controlling the Internet will entrench big tech players, stymie innovation, and lead to press censorship through the back door.</p><p><br/>Matthew Lesh, Head of Research at free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute, says:<br/>\"The Government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the Western world in internet censorship.<br/>\"The proposals are a historic attack on freedom of speech and the free press, the very core of Britain's liberal democratic foundations. At a time when Britain is criticising violations of freedom of expression in states like Iran, China and Russia, we should not be undermining our freedom at home. Britain will no longer be called a free society if her citizens and her press are directed by Government as to what they can view, think and say.<br/>\"The Government aren't just targeting illegal material, they explicitly want to censor 'Harms with a less clear legal definition,' that is, otherwise completely legal speech. It's not hard to imagine an overly zealous government regulator and risk adverse tech sites, who want to avoid fines and going to jail, removing swaths of lawful speech.<br/>\"The scope of this censorship will include 'any company that allows users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other online,' basically the entity of the internet - not just the tech giants. This covers web forums like Mumsnet, online retailers like Amazon, travel websites like TripAdvisor, and even news websites.<br/>\"If Britain wants to have a thriving tech and start-up sector, regulating them into oblivion is probably not the right approach.<br/>\"These measures will entrench the market position of the tech giants like Facebook - because they can afford to comply with the massive new costs of this red tape. Mark Zuckerberg gleefully called for more regulation last week. It'll be start-ups and smaller sites which will suffer under the heavy hand of this regime.\"<br/>If you have any questions or wish to arrange an interview with Matthew Lesh please contact ASI media line on 07904099599\u00a0or via <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:matt@adamsmith.org\">matt@adamsmith.org</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-59987</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Adam Smith, Great Britain All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Adam Smith Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Cohen, in fact, said she has personally recommended this to the Trump administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cohen believes that, as a supplement to President Donald Trump's prolific tweeting, the White House should create an Internet radio station to carry the president's speeches and staff interviews, and set up a news app, which would cost users $1, to fund programs for military veterans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cohen, like many of her fellow conservatives, is frustrated by the national media not giving Trump a fair shake  a problem compounded by Big Tech's biased masking of right-wing content.</p><p> I get where Cohen is coming from. But the last thing Americans should desire, regardless of who holds power, is for the government to set up anything that could be construed as a \"news\" outlet. Think Izvestia. Minju Choson. Granma. The Washington Post (when a Democrat occupies the Oval Office).</p><p> Yet worse than what Cohen wants is Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposal to \"save\" journalism, should he become president, as outlined in a lengthy op-ed he published in August in the Columbia Journalism Review.</p><p> Naturally, Sanders cites Trump's \"authoritarian bullying\" of the media as one cause of journalism's current woes. Yeah, the media is so bullied by Trump that it calls him a racist, sexist tyrant just 23 hours out of every day instead of 24.</p><p> But, if he becomes president, the Vermont Independent promises to unleash battalions of Sandersnista regulatory agents to intervene in newsrooms to a degree that should send shudders down the spines of reporters, editors, publishers and broadcasters everywhere.</p><p> Bernie's mission is to take the fight to those who seek \"further expansion of oligarchic business models\" that can only \"make matters worse\" for journalists, and by extension the public.</p><p> That entails, for instance, blocking media mergers until his regulators can deem them safe for \"democracy,\" or are convinced such deals won't \"adversely affect people of color and women.\" How that gets measured or determined is anyone's guess.</p><p> The Sanders regime also would mandate WARN notices if \"corporate transactions and merger proposals\" mean \"significant\" layoffs. And his administration would require employees be granted right of first refusal to buy their newspapers or news stations if the owner intends to sell.</p><p> Bernie maintains that Trump's green-lighting of ownership of multiple news outlets in the same market could turn \"your community into a one-newsroom town.\" Some of us might argue that's better than a no-newsroom town. Still, Bernie promises \"new, progressive leadership\" to overturn Team Trump's reforms that facilitated cross-pollination of holdings by media company owners in a single market.</p><p> Bernie's bro-euacrats would put media consolidation ventures under the antitrust microscope, as would the Zuckerbergs and Pichais of the online world \"to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations.\"</p><p> Moreover, Sanders would enact a \"Workplace Democracy Plan\" that would \"boost media workers' laudable efforts\" to unionize. Union workers comprise 6.4 percent of the private-sector workforce, and union membership overall has been halved in the last 35 years. Yet newsrooms, Detroit and professional sports seem to be the last bastions for organized labor in corporate America. So Bernie may find allies on this one.</p><p> And speaking of collective bargaining, Sanders seeks to empower media organizations to do that with Big Tech to protect smaller media operations. He also promotes a tax on Silicon Valley's targeted ads to raise money \"to fund nonprofit civic-minded media,\" just as \"other countries already fund independent public media.\"</p><p> Journalism may be suffering. But its contemporary woes are not the fault of Trump or the billionaire CEOs Bernie loves to hate, and tax. So, his rescue plan reveals the mindset of an idealistic, Maoist campus hippy from the '70s who has never had to make a payroll.</p><p> \"Legacy media\" at all levels is transitioning, and struggling to figure out the next step while being buffeted by changing consumer tastes, reduced public trust and web-oriented technological shifts that have expanded the universe of those who gather, disseminate and profit from the news.</p><p> Bernie maintains he is for \"independent\" media, but no media outlet owner in their right mind who hopes to survive would dare assert independence in the face of this regulatory onslaught. If Bernie wins next year, we might not get the state-run alternative that Adriana Cohen wants for Trump. But we will get government infringement on media operations in a way such that we won't be able to tell the difference.</p><p> Bill Thompson is the editorial page editor of The Ledger in Lakeland, Florida.

Cohen, in fact, said she has personally recommended this to the Trump administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cohen believes that, as a supplement to President Donald Trump\u2019s prolific tweeting, the White House should create an Internet radio station to carry the president\u2019s speeches and staff interviews, and set up a news app, which would cost users $1, to fund programs for military veterans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cohen, like many of her fellow conservatives, is frustrated by the national media not giving Trump a fair shake \u2014 a problem compounded by Big Tech\u2019s biased masking of right-wing content.</p><p>I get where Cohen is coming from. But the last thing Americans should desire, regardless of who holds power, is for the government to set up anything that could be construed as a \u201cnews\u201d outlet. Think Izvestia. Minju Choson. Granma. The Washington Post (when a Democrat occupies the Oval Office).</p><p>Yet worse than what Cohen wants is Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposal to \u201csave\u201d journalism, should he become president, as outlined in a lengthy op-ed he published in August in the Columbia Journalism Review.</p><p>Naturally, Sanders cites Trump\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian bullying\u201d of the media as one cause of journalism\u2019s current woes. Yeah, the media is so bullied by Trump that it calls him a racist, sexist tyrant just 23 hours out of every day instead of 24.</p><p>But, if he becomes president, the Vermont Independent promises to unleash battalions of Sandersnista regulatory agents to intervene in newsrooms to a degree that should send shudders down the spines of reporters, editors, publishers and broadcasters everywhere.</p><p>Bernie\u2019s mission is to take the fight to those who seek \u201cfurther expansion of oligarchic business models\u201d that can only \u201cmake matters worse\u201d for journalists, and by extension the public.</p><p>That entails, for instance, blocking media mergers until his regulators can deem them safe for \u201cdemocracy,\u201d or are convinced such deals won\u2019t \u201cadversely affect people of color and women.\u201d How that gets measured or determined is anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>The Sanders regime also would mandate WARN notices if \u201ccorporate transactions and merger proposals\u201d mean \u201csignificant\u201d layoffs. And his administration would require employees be granted right of first refusal to buy their newspapers or news stations if the owner intends to sell.</p><p>Bernie maintains that Trump\u2019s green-lighting of ownership of multiple news outlets in the same market could turn \u201cyour community into a one-newsroom town.\u201d Some of us might argue that\u2019s better than a no-newsroom town. Still, Bernie promises \u201cnew, progressive leadership\u201d to overturn Team Trump\u2019s reforms that facilitated cross-pollination of holdings by media company owners in a single market.</p><p>Bernie\u2019s bro-euacrats would put media consolidation ventures under the antitrust microscope, as would the Zuckerbergs and Pichais of the online world \u201cto prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations.\u201d</p><p>Moreover, Sanders would enact a \u201cWorkplace Democracy Plan\u201d that would \u201cboost media workers\u2019 laudable efforts\u201d to unionize. Union workers comprise 6.4 percent of the private-sector workforce, and union membership overall has been halved in the last 35 years. Yet newsrooms, Detroit and professional sports seem to be </p><p>the last bastions for organized labor in corporate America. So Bernie may find allies on this one. And speaking of collective bargaining, Sanders seeks to empower media organizations to do that with Big Tech to protect smaller media operations. He also promotes a tax on Silicon Valley\u2019s targeted ads to raise money \u201cto fund nonprofit civic-minded media,\u201d just as \u201cother countries already fund independent public media.\u201d</p><p>Journalism may be suffering. But its contemporary woes are not the fault of Trump or the billionaire CEOs Bernie loves to hate, and tax. So, his rescue plan reveals the mindset of an idealistic, Maoist campus hippy from the \u201870s who has never had to make a payroll.</p><p>\u201cLegacy media\u201d at all levels is transitioning, and struggling to figure out the next step while being buffeted by changing consumer tastes, reduced public trust and web-oriented technological shifts that have expanded the universe of those who gather, disseminate and profit from the news.</p><p>Bernie maintains he is for \u201cindependent\u201d media, but no media outlet owner in their right mind who hopes to survive would dare assert independence in the face of this regulatory onslaught. If Bernie wins next year, we might not get the state-run alternative that Adriana Cohen wants for Trump. But we will get government infringement on media operations in a way such that we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bill Thompson is the editorial page editor of The Ledger in Lakeland, Florida.

But it fully embraces the idea of bias when it comes to gender inequality.David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish software developer, tweeted[2] that Apple's 'black box algorithm' gave him 20 times the credit limit as his wife. 'No appeals work,' he claimed. </p><p>In addition, even though his wife paid off her limit[3] in full, 'the card won't approve any spending until the next billing period.' His tweet thread, according to The New York Times[4], prompted New York state regulators to investigate Apple Card's algorithm.When Hansson's wife tried to get an answer from Apple, the customer service representatives informed her that it was the 'algorithm[5]' that was causing the problem. Hansson tweeted[6], 'Yet everyone we've talked to from both Apple and GS are SO SURE that THE ALGORITHM isn't biased and discriminating in any way. That's some grade-A management of cognitive dissonance.'He went[7] on to claim, 'This is the soft undermining of people's sense of self. The algorithm might discriminate out of biased historical training data, faulty but uncorrectable inputs, programming errors, or malicious intent. You'll never be able to know.'Apple's co-founder, Steve Wozniak[8], tweeted, 'The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.'

Rep.

The Post ran a piece from Bloomberg explaining, 'How the Algorithms Running Your Life Are Biased[14].' It determined that 'when data is misused, software can compound stereotypes or arrive at false conclusions.'

But it fully embraces the idea of bias when it comes to gender inequality.David Heinemeier Hansson, a Danish software developer, tweeted[2] that Apple's 'black box algorithm' gave him 20 times the credit limit as his wife. 'No appeals work,' he claimed. </p><p>In addition, even though his wife paid off her limit[3] in full, 'the card won't approve any spending until the next billing period.' His tweet thread, according to The New York Times[4], prompted New York state regulators to investigate Apple Card's algorithm.When Hansson's wife tried to get an answer from Apple, the customer service representatives informed her that it was the 'algorithm[5]' that was causing the problem. Hansson tweeted[6], 'Yet everyone we've talked to from both Apple and GS are SO SURE that THE ALGORITHM isn't biased and discriminating in any way. That's some grade-A management of cognitive dissonance.'He went[7] on to claim, 'This is the soft undermining of people's sense of self. The algorithm might discriminate out of biased historical training data, faulty but uncorrectable inputs, programming errors, or malicious intent. You'll never be able to know.'Apple's co-founder, Steve Wozniak[8], tweeted, 'The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.' He later added[9], 'Who knows what the algorithm is.'In the discussion surrounding the censorship of conservatives[10], the liberal media and Democrats have labelled the topic as a 'conspiracy theory rather than verifiable fact.' Rep. Jerry Nadler[11] (D-NY) called the censorship of conservatives a 'right-wing conspiracy theory' at a hearing where Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified in front of Congress.Dr. Robert Epstein[12], a research psychologist, said that algorithms 'are programmed to put one thing ahead of another in a way that is highly secret and ever-changing.'Meanwhile, The Washington Post, which asserts that censorship of conservatives online is a mere 'criticisms[13],' has a different take when it comes to gender bias. The Post ran a piece from Bloomberg explaining, 'How the Algorithms Running Your Life Are Biased[14].' It determined that 'when data is misused, software can compound stereotypes or arrive at false conclusions.'

In a Lords report, peers said that could mean it would not be implemented until 2024, seven years after first being proposed.</p><p>Labour pointed to analysis that showed Abbott received more than half of all the abuse on social media aimed at female MPs, as well as new evidence that the anti-vaccine movement has been growing on other social media platforms.</p><p>Jo Stevens, the shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said only legislation would force social media companies to take action.</p><p>The Labour MP said: \"Social media companies have had repeated opportunities to show they can police their sites effectively.

There is no excuse for delay. The government must urgently table the online harms bill to put an end to vile hatred and dangerous medical misinformation online.\"</p><p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \"There is no delay, and we continue to work at pace to deliver the most comprehensive regime to tackling online harms anywhere in the world. We will bring forward new legislation after we publish the full government response this autumn as planned.</p><p>\"We will introduce new laws to place a duty of care on online platforms to ensure they keep their users safe.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64738031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FG-NF81-F021-60PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><timeReceived>10:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Now a number of people in and out[5] of government are calling for federal regulation[6] of social media. Lay down some rules[7], the thinking goes, and we would be able to prevent the infestation of bots and fake news from our news feeds and ads. Democracy would be saved - or, at least, foreign interference in our elections kept in check. </p><p>However, as someone who has studied and taught the First Amendment[8] for decades, I would argue that if such regulations were enacted, the main victims would be not the purveyors of fake news, but our freedom of expression. In my view, the result would do far more damage to our democracy than any foreign misinformation campaign ever could. Free speech being attacked from all sides The First Amendment is under a lot of duress. Arguably, it's been that way since the Supreme Court's 'clear and present danger[9]' decision in 1919, which spelled out when limits on free speech could be lawful. It not only held that the government had an obligation to stop someone from 'falsely shouting fire in a theater,' but also opened the gates to all manner of government violations of the First Amendment injunction that 'Congress shall make no lawabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.' These range from the FCC's 'Fairness Doctrine,' which was upheld by the Supreme Court, that required broadcasters to present controversial issues in a balanced way (in the FCC's view), to the FCC's warning to radio broadcasters in 1971[10] not to play songs that glorified drug use, which actually had the effect of limiting the airplay of songs that critiqued drug culture[11]. Indeed, with the exception of Supreme Court decisions in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 and the Communications Decency Act in 1997, the American government has systematically increased its control of media[12]. The situation has gotten much worse over the past year. President Trump has tweeted about withholding the licenses of NBC[13] affiliates and lashed out[14] at other media not to his liking. Although Trump's bluster about limiting and punishing media may be easy enough to deride, the fact that he is in the White House - and has the ability to appoint FCC commissioners - means his threats must be taken seriously. Meanwhile, a theory of philosopher Karl Popper - the 'paradox of tolerance' - is being widely cited[15] as a justification for outlawing hate speech, notwithstanding the First Amendment. From his 1945 book 'The Open Society and its Enemies[16],' it says that tolerance defeats itself when it permits intolerant speech. I studied Popper extensively while researching my first book[17], an anthology of essays about Popper's work. There are many aspects of Popper's philosophy to admire, but I don't believe the 'paradox of tolerance' is among them. To ban hate speech could turn our tolerant, democratic society into precisely the kind of state that hate speech is calling for: It could open up an opportunity for all sorts of speech to be dubbed 'hate speech.' A slippery slope When regulating fake news on social media sites, there's the danger of the same sort of phenomenon taking place. And it's exactly why the well-meaning hue-and-cry[18] that the government needs to intervene and forbid social media sites from disseminating fake news or allowing accounts that are actually bots is so dangerous. Fake news is nothing new[19]. Centuries ago, anti-Semitic publications spread rumors that Jews murdered Christian children and drank their blood on holidays. Over the past two years, social media have increased the amplitude and reach of fake news. But there's also been the ascension of a political figure - Trump - who has turned the tables by labeling any unwelcome news as 'fake.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/195521/original/file-20171120-18528-18j8dlw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/195521/original/file-20171120-18528-18j8dlw.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>Facebook ads linked to a Russian effort to disrupt the American political process are displayed as representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 1. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo[20]  The latter should be more than enough reason to reject calls for government censorship of fake news[21]. After all, who's to say a government that determines what's 'fake' won't simply follow Trump's lead, and suppress critical and truthful content under the guise that it's fake? Instead, social media networks could develop and implement algorithms for identifying and removing fake news by marshaling the same engines that spread fake news in the first place. These algorithms would not be administered by the government; rather, Facebook and other social media would be responsible. Twitter has already made considerable progress flagging and removing accounts that spread Islamic State propaganda[22]. There's no reason to think that the same process can't be applied to Russian bots seeking to inflame political discord and therein damage America's political system. Such self-regulation is in the best interest of these media companies. It would increase the confidence of their users in what they encounter online. It would also have the added benefit of keeping government regulators at bay. In the end, the ultimate antidote to fake news and bots is the rationality of the human mind. As John Milton famously urged in his 'Areopagitica[23],' if you let truth and falsity fight it out in the marketplace of ideas, human rationality will most likely choose the truth. Regulating what can enter that marketplace could impair or destroy this process, by inadvertently keeping truth from public awareness. Rational thinking's ability to identify fake news is more than a Miltonian ideal: It's been demonstrated in a carefully conducted 2015 experiment[24]. When given a small financial incentive, the subjects were able to identify fake news as fake, even if the fake news supported the political views of the subjects. Indeed, rationality is deeply implicit in democracy itself. You can't have the latter without the former. The key in combating fake news and kindred attacks on our body politic is to give our rationality maximum access to all information, including the truth. And in my view, this means resisting any attempts by government to limit the information that reaches us.

But while the spread of misinformation and election interference has garnered most of the headlines, the real concern shared by governments and business leaders around the world is where our data is being stored. German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently said as much, saying that the European Union should claim 'digital sovereignty[1]' from the Silicon Valley tech giants that control the cloud. </p><p>'So many companies have just outsourced all their data to U.S. companies,' she reportedly told German business leaders. And she has reason to be concerned. Based on figures from their most recent earnings reports, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN[2]) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT[3]) collectively control roughly 63% of the global cloud computing market. Though the growth rates of their respective cloud products has slowed, paving the way other companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG[4]) (NASDAQ: GOOGL[5]), IBM (NYSE: IBM[6]), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL[7]), the dominance that a few U.S. firms have on the world's information storage has gotten to the point where other solutions are being sought out beyond Big Tech and internal clouds. The financial services industry began taking matters into its own hands last week, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC[8]) announcing a partnership with IBM to launch a public cloud specifically for financial services. Red Hat, officially acquired by IBM in July, and Promontory Financial Group, IBM's compliance arm, are also involved in the project. According to Bank of America Chief Operations and Technology Officer Cathy Bessant, 80% of the bank's workloads run in its private cloud. Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for global industries, clients, platforms and blockchain at IBM, said that[9] 'Governance, risk and compliance consumes around 20% of the operations costs of most major banks.' The move to a public cloud specific to banks is simultaneously meant to reduce costs, increase security, and improve compliance. 'Generally speaking, banks have compliance issues, not storage problems,' said Darren Conte, founder and CEO of Siftsort.com, a secure documents and messaging platform. 'Migrating to cloud technology is driven by its cost savings. But for regulated industries, that approach has to be carefully thought out to avoid creating compliance risks.' It also comes in the wake of Capital One Financial Corp's (NYSE: COF[10]) data breach, after which members of Congress had asked regulators to consider more oversight of the cloud services being provided to financial services. Conte, a former Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS[11]) executive, feels that in the wake of various 'virtual private cloud' breaches affecting top-tier banks, the idea of a proprietary cloud designed specifically for banks starts to make more sense, especially if regulation is mandated. 'As cloud technology gets wider adoption from banks, compliance rules will continue to change to ensure strict adherence and governance. Over time, that may force banks to build or migrate to a regulated solution specific to their industry needs.' Photo byCarson Masterson[12]onUnsplash[13] 0   2019 Benzinga.com.

Conveniently, this lack of regulation allowed them to build massive monopolies and make huge profits.</p><p>Today, Silicon Valley is facing the backlash. Amid widespread concerns over fake news, influence campaigns, cybersecurity and the sharing of violent and extremist content, more and more countries are pushing to rein in big tech.</p><p/><p>Regulation overdrive</p><p>Last week, after just two days of deliberations ? and over the protests of critical lawmakers, industry experts and rights groups ? Australia introduced new legislation in response to New Zealand's Christchurch massacre, much of which was streamed online. Under the laws, internet firms like Facebook and Google will be compelled to remove violent content or face massive fines and even prison time.</p><p>While Australia has a history of overreaching when it comes to internet regulation ? a plan for a web blacklist was abandoned in 2010 amid widespread criticism ? the country is by no means alone in the latest push for greater control.</p><p>On Monday, the UK government proposed sweeping new powers to tackle violent content, fake news and harmful material. Like Australia, these regulations would impose obligations on web companies, and give a newly constituted internet regulator the ability to issue fines and block sites.</p><p>\"It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed,\" Jeremy Wright, the UK's secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, wrote in a piece for CNN Opinion. He promised to make tech firms responsible \"for tackling harmful content and activity online.\"</p><p>\"(We) will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse,\" Wright added.</p><p>In the US, where tech firms have benefited most from decades of sympathetic legislation and constitutional protections for free speech, there are calls for similar action.</p><p>On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed the creation of a news and information ombudsman \"with the power to fine egregious corporate offenders.\"</p><p>\"We need a robust free press and exchange of information. But we should face the reality that fake news and misinformation spread via social media threatens to undermine our democracy and may make it impossible for citizens to make informed decisions on a shared set of facts,\" Yang said in a statement. \"This is particularly problematic given that foreign actors, particularly Russia, intend to do us harm and capitalize on our freedom of information. We need to start monitoring and punishing bad actors to give the determined journalists a chance to do their work.\"</p><p>In Singapore, meanwhile, a new anti-fake news bill will make it illegal to spread \"false statements of fact\" where that information is \"prejudicial\" to Singapore's security, public safety, \"public tranquility,\" or to the \"friendly relations of Singapore with other countries,\" among numerous other topics.</p><p/><p>Free speech concerns</p><p>Few people would deny that there are major issues with the internet, and that government action is required to fix them.</p><p>\"While the web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commit,\" Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, wrote last month on the technology's 30th anniversary. Even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has called for greater regulation.</p><p>But while many of the problems have come as a result of governments' hands-off approach to big tech, many of the proposed ? or in Australia's case, enacted ? laws actually give more power to companies to police content.</p><p>This could be seen as a \"you broke it, you fix it,\" approach, but the risk is that platforms, which are not subject to the same kinds of obligations to protect free speech or expression as governments, end up deleting anything politically sensitive.</p><p>Such is the case in China, where private tech firms carry out the majority of internet censorship. Because the law provides only vague guidelines on what needs to be controlled, while carrying big penalties for the failure to do so, companies typically err on the side of censorship -- a situation that compounds the country's already stringent controls on speech.</p><p>\"Internet regulation needs a calm, evidence-based approach that safeguards freedom of expression rather than undermining it,\" said Joy Hyvarinen, head of advocacy for the London-based Index on Censorship.</p><p>Index said that the proposed \"duty of care\" for internet companies under the British law could create a \"strong incentive for online platforms to restrict and remove content.\"</p><p>Already, users who find their content or pages removed from social media have limited ability to appeal. Activists, particularly on the political fringes, have expressed concern that this could lead to the increased marginalization of minority or dissident voices.</p><p>\"Forcing companies to regulate content under threat of criminal liability is likely to lead to over-removal and censorship as the companies attempt their best to avoid jail time for their executives or hefty fines on their turnover,\" internet freedom group Access Now said about the new Australian laws. \"Also worryingly, the bill could encourage online companies to constantly surveil internet users by requiring proactive measures for general content monitoring, a measure that would be a blow to free speech and privacy online.\"</p><p>The internet is not independent of national governments, a fact they have made abundantly clear in the decades since John Perry Barlow issued his declaration.</p><p>But nor is it free from the regulation and control of private companies. And as regulators all over the world attempt to fix the problems their own inaction helped create, the risk is that both their power and the power of big tech increases -- at the expense of ordinary users.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190407internet-regulation-uk-australia-intl-gbr1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-GNX1-JBPX-X3CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><timeReceived>2:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 7, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Conveniently, this lack of regulation allowed them to build massive monopolies and make huge profits. </p><p>Today, Silicon Valley is facing the backlash. Amid widespread concerns over fake news, influence campaigns, cybersecurity and the sharing of violent and extremist content, more and more countries are pushing to rein in big tech. </p><p>Regulation overdrive </p><p>Last week, after just two days of deliberations --- and over the protests of critical lawmakers, industry experts and rights groups --- Australia introduced new legislation in response to New Zealand's Christchurch massacre, much of which was streamed online. Under the laws, internet firms like Facebook and Google will be compelled to remove violent content or face massive fines and even prison time.</p><p>While Australia has a history of overreaching when it comes to internet regulation --- a plan for a web blacklist was abandoned in 2010 amid widespread criticism --- the country is by no means alone in the latest push for greater control. </p><p>On Monday, the UK government proposed sweeping new powers to tackle violent content, fake news and harmful material. Like Australia, these regulations would impose obligations on web companies, and give a newly constituted internet regulator the ability to issue fines and block sites. </p><p>\"It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed,\" Jeremy Wright, the UK's secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, wrote in a piece for CNN Opinion. He promised to make tech firms responsible \"for tackling harmful content and activity online.\"</p><p>\"(We) will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse,\" Wright added. </p><p>In the US, where tech firms have benefited most from decades of sympathetic legislation and constitutional protections for free speech, there are calls for similar action. </p><p>On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed the creation of a news and information ombudsman \"with the power to fine egregious corporate offenders.\" </p><p>\"We need a robust free press and exchange of information. But we should face the reality that fake news and misinformation spread via social media threatens to undermine our democracy and may make it impossible for citizens to make informed decisions on a shared set of facts,\" Yang said in a statement. \"This is particularly problematic given that foreign actors, particularly Russia, intend to do us harm and capitalize on our freedom of information. We need to start monitoring and punishing bad actors to give the determined journalists a chance to do their work.\" </p><p>In Singapore, meanwhile, a new anti-fake news bill will make it illegal to spread \"false statements of fact\" where that information is \"prejudicial\" to Singapore's security, public safety, \"public tranquility,\" or to the \"friendly relations of Singapore with other countries,\" among numerous other topics.</p><p>Free speech concerns</p><p>Few people would deny that there are major issues with the internet, and that government action is required to fix them. </p><p>\"While the web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commit,\" Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, wrote last month on the technology's 30th anniversary. Even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has called for greater regulation. </p><p>But while many of the problems have come as a result of governments' hands-off approach to big tech, many of the proposed --- or in Australia's case, enacted --- laws actually give more power to companies to police content. </p><p>This could be seen as a \"you broke it, you fix it,\" approach, but the risk is that platforms, which are not subject to the same kinds of obligations to protect free speech or expression as governments, end up deleting anything politically sensitive. </p><p>Such is the case in China, where private tech firms carry out the majority of internet censorship. Because the law provides only vague guidelines on what needs to be controlled, while carrying big penalties for the failure to do so, companies typically err on the side of censorship -- a situation that compounds the country's already stringent controls on speech.</p><p>\"Internet regulation needs a calm, evidence-based approach that safeguards freedom of expression rather than undermining it,\" said Joy Hyvarinen, head of advocacy for the London-based Index on Censorship. </p><p>Index said that the proposed \"duty of care\" for internet companies under the British law could create a \"strong incentive for online platforms to restrict and remove content.\" </p><p>Already, users who find their content or pages removed from social media have limited ability to appeal. Activists, particularly on the political fringes, have expressed concern that this could lead to the increased marginalization of minority or dissident voices.</p><p>\"Forcing companies to regulate content under threat of criminal liability is likely to lead to over-removal and censorship as the companies attempt their best to avoid jail time for their executives or hefty fines on their turnover,\" internet freedom group Access Now said about the new Australian laws. \"Also worryingly, the bill could encourage online companies to constantly surveil internet users by requiring proactive measures for general content monitoring, a measure that would be a blow to free speech and privacy online.\"</p><p>The internet is not independent of national governments, a fact they have made abundantly clear in the decades since John Perry Barlow issued his declaration. </p><p>But nor is it free from the regulation and control of private companies. And as regulators all over the world attempt to fix the problems their own inaction helped create, the risk is that both their power and the power of big tech increases -- at the expense of ordinary users. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Depending on the outcome, the case could fundamentally upend Silicon Valley s calculus when pursuing major new mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>It s not just the Trump administration s apparent interest in the aggressive application of antitrust law, which few observers anticipated when the former businessman swept into office last year. By challenging a vertical merger, or the combination of two businesses operating at separate levels of an industrial ecosystem, experts say DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim is bucking a longtime trend of regulators waving similar acquisitions through with little oversight.</p><p>That s bad news for Silicon Valley especially if the DOJ is successful since most of big tech s mergers and acquisitions tend to be vertical in nature.</p><p> If this is a successful challenge in court, then that would put the [tech] industry on notice that they would have to think twice before engaging in even a vertical merger,  said Michael Carrier, a professor of antitrust law at Rutgers University.  This focus on vertical mergers could affect companies like Amazon in a way it wouldn t have a few years ago. </p><p>When coupled with growing public anxiety over the power accumulated by tech giants and large media conglomerates, the case could spell serious trouble down the road for Silicon Valley behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.</p><p> I think when you see skepticism of excessive concentration in the tech sector in particular it s coming from the Left and the Right,  said John Bergmayer, the senior counsel at progressive tech group Public Knowledge.  It s not just purely an Elizabeth Warren issue. You see people of all kinds concerned with the power that these companies have over everyday life. </p><p>The Justice Department is set to argue that the combination of AT&amp;T s distribution platform with the  must-have  media content owned by Time Warner will unfairly harm competitors and incentivize coordination with other media mega-conglomerates like Comcast-NBCUniversal.</p><p>Under U.S. antitrust law, regulators typically must prove significant harm to consumers, and not just competitors, in order to block a merger. That model technically still holds in this case, since Delrahim is arguing that the undue burdens placed on AT&amp;T-Time Warner s rivals would raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation that would provide users with entertainment options at lower cost.</p><p>Alden Abbott, an antitrust expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, points to that consumer-focused argument as proof that the DOJ isn t breaking new ground with the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case.</p><p> There s always an interest in the general press to want to say,  Oh, there s change in political leadership; suddenly the antitrust laws are going to be interpreted differently,   said Abbott, who added that he s  not surprised  by Delrahim s decision to target the merger.</p><p>But most other observers say the Trump administration s move to block a vertical merger breaks a decades-long trend of federal regulators approving such acquisitions with, at best, very limited conditions.</p><p> We re dealing with a lot of vertical-integration issues, which are now being looked much more skeptically at than they have in the past,  said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute.</p><p>That skepticism, so starkly illuminated by the Trump administration s opposition to AT&amp;T-Time Warner, has big Silicon Valley firms pumping the brakes on similar acquisitions designed to expand their reach across their industry ecosystems. Any plans that Amazon or Facebook might have had to acquire new content creators, or that Google might have had to purchase any of the myriad products or services it hopes to plug into its platform, are likely on hold pending the trial s conclusion.</p><p> So far these companies have kind of laid low,  said Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer at Carr &amp; Ferrell focused on Silicon Valley. Should the DOJ win the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case, Reback said, future acquisitions similar to Google s $1 billion purchase of navigation-software firm Waze in 2013 could run afoul of U.S. regulators.</p><p>Joe Kennedy, an antitrust expert at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said he believes Silicon Valley is carefully eyeing the trial s outcome, and even if the government loses, executives at big technology firms are likely to remain wary for quite a while.</p><p> This administration, which a lot of people thought was maybe going to be too pro-business, is maybe turning out to be not so much pro-business but pro-populist, with a suspicion of bigness,  Kennedy said.</p><p>That suspicion of bigness is echoing well beyond the halls of the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, a flood of public advocacy against the concentration of corporate power particularly in tech prompted Sen. Orrin Hatch to take to the Senate floor and condemn what he called a  hipster antitrust  movement and  the old, lazy mantra that big is bad. </p><p>Yet Hatch is reluctant to criticize the Trump administration for its targeting of AT&amp;T-Time Warner; the senator told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> that the case hasn t caused him much concern.  I think [they re] taking the job very seriously,  Hatch said of the administration.</p><p>Experts in Washington are increasingly turning their eye to Silicon Valley firms, which in many ways represent a new frontier for antitrust, raising a host of new questions.  How do they compete? What are the markets that are involved? What strategies are used or not used? How is innovation affected?  asked Moss, whose think tank is holding a roundtable on Thursday to examine the application of antitrust law to digital platforms.</p><p>Much of the current anti-merger momentum, of course, may be blunted should AT&amp;T prevail against the government.  A key indicator will be how strong the government s case is when it actually lays all this out,  said Kennedy, who cautioned that the Trump administration s focus on AT&amp;T-Time Warner may be predicated more on the president s personal animus toward CNN, a Time Warner subsidiary, than any principled antitrust position.</p><p>But even so, it s unlikely the campaign for greater antitrust enforcement against Silicon Valley would perish with the DOJ s case.  There s a fear that these companies are sinking their tentacles more and more into our lives,  Carrier said.  And so that s why there s a fear of what is going on in this industry. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-665371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX2-WDP1-JBNW-32K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Policy makers have introduced initiatives ranging from media literacy education to a 'red-button service' allowing citizens to report fake news to a special cyber police unit.Disinformation, misinformation, fake news and online propaganda\u2014these are all concepts frequently debated in Italy. Even Pope Francis has commented on the dangers of fake news, comparing them to the serpent's disinformation campaign in the Garden of Eden[2].Italy has plenty of recent experience with those dangers. Ahead of an important constitutional referendum in 2016, BuzzFeed published a study[3] pinpointing how fake news\u2014emanating from dubious websites with links to the Kremlin\u2014was being shared widely on social media. The study also found that the Five Star Movement, which is now part of the Italian government, helped spreading fake news stories.Then, in March 2018, the country's general election was subjected to coordinated influence campaigns[4] originating from Russia, and several disinformation narratives flourished[5]. Such events led one expert, the University of Florence's Carlo Fusaro, to call Italy a 'showcase' of how [6]'misinformation may impact politics.'Politicians worry about fake news But the problems with fake news have not been ignored. Several prominent Italian politicians, including former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, have raised concerns[7]. Renzi himself was subjected to a smear campaign on Twitter led by a fake account, which turned out to be operated by Tommasa Giovannoni Ottaviani[8], the wife of famous Forza Italia politician Renato Brunetta.Laura Boldrini, a former president of the lower house of Italy's parliament, has also been a victim of false reports. A widely shared hoax charged that Boldrini gave her brother a government job at a monthly salary of 47,000 euros. Nothing in the story was true, but it went viral anyway. The hoax was eventually traced to Gian Marco Centinaio of the Lega Nord party, who published a post with the false story[9] on his Facebook page in September 2017.#Enough-with-the-hoaxesJust a month later, Boldrini spearheaded an anti-disinformation initiative called 'Enough hoaxes' ('Basta Bufale'), which brought together[10] the Italian Ministry of Education, big tech companies like Facebook and Google, and l Rai, Italy's public broadcaster. The initiative teaches young people how to spot fake news and improve their media literacy skills. Consequently, more than four million high-school students[11] across the country have had fake news on the school curriculum since October 2017.The teaching materials include a fake-news manual[12] listing eight basic practices for mindful and critical news consumption.Students also receive guidance on how to create a personal blog that calls out fake news\u2014a way for them to live up to the last suggestion in the manual: 'Be a good example; do not regret the darkness, but turn on the light.'A red button to alert the cyber policeThe aim of the media literacy program was to build long-term resilience, but other Italian initiatives have a more short-term focus. Two months before the general election in 2018, a special cyber police unit[13] under the Italian state police launched an initiative to protect the election: A protocol for combating fake news[14].The protocol outlined how the online police unit would fight fake news, including how they collect, analyze, and respond to misleading stories. This included a so-called 'red button service[15]' through which citizens could report fake news stories directly to the police.If the cyber police unit found evidence that a news article or post was indeed a hoax, they would communicate this via their own channels and websites. The unit also helped citizens request that social platforms to remove the false content they had found If the post or news piece was defamatory or otherwise illegal, the unit would file a lawsuit[16].A proposed law against information manipulationBut he possibilities for legal action were\u2014and still are -\u2014limited. A group of senators from different political parties proposed a bill in February 2017[17] that would make it illegal to write or distribute fake news in Italy, but it has not yet become law.According to the bill, anyone who publishes or disseminates 'fake, exaggerated or biased news' using data or facts that are 'manifestly unfounded or untrue' via social media or other non-news sites risks being fined 5,000 euros. If the false news piece is clearly harmful to the public interest, or if it alarms the public, the proposed sentence is imprisonment for up to one year. If the false story is aimed at undermining democracy in Italy, or if it is part of a hate campaign against an individual, the sentence is two years' imprisonment and a fine of up to 10,000 euros.The bill also contains a controversial provision that requires anyone who wants to start a blog, website or discussion forum to seek official approval from the authorities. This provision has been criticized by several experts[18] as a violation of the freedom of speech\u2014a right that is protected both by the Italian constitution[19] and the European Convention on Human Rights[20].Self-regulationThe fake-news law has not advanced out of its parliamentary committee, but a self-regulation initiative was implemented in February 2018. Behind the initiative is a working group set up by the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM) that includes representatives from both social platforms and Italian newspapers. The initiative consists of a set of guidelines[21] that digital platforms and other actors can voluntarily adopt to ensure equal treatment of all political parties. The initiative was launched in March 2018 ahead of the general election.The guidelines call for equal access to exposure on the platforms for all parties; transparency about election advertisements; sharing of methods on how to detect illegal content on the platforms; expanding existing rules for public communication[22] during elections (which forbid public administration agencies to carry out communication activities during elections) to cover social media, expanding the electoral silence rules[23] (which prohibit political campaigning on Election Day and the day before) to cover social media, and finally, recommending a strengthening of the online fact-checking tools already introduced on platforms like Google and Facebook.Participation in international initiativesDespite those bills and programs, there is not much vocal domestic support for anti-disinformation initiatives in Italy. That may be why Giovanni Pitruzzella, the head of the Italian Competition Authority, an antitrust and consumer-protection regulator has called on the EU to set up a European antitrust network[24] to fight the spread of fake news on the Internet. He has also argued in favor of[25] introducing some form of regulation against fake news. But the idea has not been taken up by the EU, and skeptics criticized[26] the idea with references to George Orwell's '1984.'Still, Italy is included in many other initiatives[27] against fake news and disinformation through its EU membership.It is also a member of the Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats[28], which specializes in countering so-called hybrid threats: disinformation, influence campaigns, and other attempts to influence public opinion by malign actors.And, in 2007, Italy supported the establishment of NATO's Strategic Communications Center[29], which monitors and analyzes online disinformation campaigns. Its employees help NATO members with insights into the newest strategic-communications techniques that can help counter disinformation.By Christina la Cour, for Disinfo Portal[30]Christina la Cour is a PhD researcher at theEuropean University Institute[31]in Florence, Italy. Her thesis considers how various governments tackle issues such as disinformation, foreign influence operations, and fake news.

It's copyright law, privacy law, labour law and media classification regulation, to name just a few of the areas in question.</p><p>Even the education curriculum will need to be reviewed, because, it seems, someone will need to teach the kiddies not to believe everything they see on Twitter. It's a monumental task.</p><p>But not everything is moving at a snail's pace.

It believes that this has left regulation of the digital environment fragmented, with gaps and overlaps, and this has been compounded by big tech companies failing to adequately tackle online harms. </p><p>RELATED CONTENT </p><p> Government data ethics body to focus on bias and micro-targeting </p><p> Public-sector AI code of conduct published </p><p> Bursting the bubble - the ethics of political campaigning in an algorithmic age </p><p>The committee recommended that a new digital authority, guided by 10 principles should inform regulation of the digital world. These 10 principles include accountability, transparency, respect for privacy and freedom of expression. The committee believes that the principles will help the industry, regulators, the government and users all work towards making the internet a better, more respectful environment. If rights were to be infringed, then the party responsible would be held accountable in a fair and transparent way, it said. </p><p>Of the core areas of recommendations, the Lords committee called for Ofcom's remit to be expanded to include responsibility for enforcing the duty of care on online services that host and curate content that can be uploaded and accessed by the public. In addition, it wants online platforms to make community standards clearer through a new classification framework, and invest in more effective moderation systems to uphold their community standards. For years, Facebook and Twitter have been called on to improve the way they moderate content, including hateful speech. </p><p>The Lords committee also said users should have greater control over the collection of personal data, and that data controllers and processors should be required to publish an annual data transparency statement detailing which forms of behavioural data they generate or purchase from third parties. It called on the Information Commissioner's Office to be empowered by the government to conduct impact-based audits where risks associated with using algorithms are the greatest. </p><p>\"The government should not just be responding to news headlines but looking ahead so that the services that constitute the digital world can be held accountable to an agreed set of principles,\" said the chairman of the committee,Lord Gilbert of Panteg. </p><p>Lord Gilbert said that self-regulation by online platforms was \"clearing failing\" and said the current regulatory framework was out-of-date. </p><p>\"The evidence we heard made a compelling and urgent case for a new approach to regulation. Without intervention, the largest tech companies are likely to gain ever more control of technologies which extract personal data and make decisions affecting people's lives,\" he said. </p><p>\"Our proposals will ensure that rights are protected online as they are offline while keeping the internet open to innovation and creativity, with a new culture of ethical behaviour embedded in the design of service.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PBTNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PBTNET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-41V1-F0JV-820H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><timeReceived>11:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PublicTechnology (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the stalemate drags on, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are either sitting at home wondering when they will be paid or are working without pay, like, say, TSA agents.  And now the president is threatening a shutdown of another kind, a full one, at the southern border if he doesn't get the funding for his wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Sarah Westwood is at the White House.  And Sarah, we understand that the president is in Washington, but all the key players are gone until next year, right?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  That's right, Martin. President Trump is alone here at the White House and increasingly frustrated with his inability to get funding for his promised border wall, and he has been continuing to blame Democrats for the persistence of the partial government shutdown, even though just a couple of weeks ago, recall that he said he would be proud to own any shutdown if it was in pursuit of money for his border wall.  </p><p> Now, despite that tweet and several others blaming Democrats for this shutdown, incoming acting chief of staff/budget director Mick Mulvaney says Congressional Democrats haven't actually been invited to the White House for further talks.  Mulvaney said the White House is now just waiting on a counteroffer from Democrats, because recall that last week Vice President Mike Pence went to Capitol Hill and offered support for a border security package plus wall funding worth about $2.5 billion.  That's an offer that Democrats rejected, so talks remain at a standstill.  </p><p> The president taking to Twitter this morning, wrote, \"I am in the White House, waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security.  From what I hear, they are spending too much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military.\"  Now, \"presidential harassment\" is the term the president has used for the investigations and oversight Democrats have promised when they come into the House majority in just five days, and that's key because the president and other White House officials have continuously blamed Nancy Pelosi, the likely next House speaker, for holding up talks.  They claim that she can't accept any kind of compromise before her speakership race on January 3rd or she will put that speaker's gavel at risk.  </p><p> The president hasn't only been focused on the shutdown.  He also had a call earlier today with the Chinese president Xi Jinping about trade as a possible trade deal with China also hangs in the balance, Martin. So a lot on his plate on this Saturday afternoon.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  A lot going on at the White House for a Saturday, just as you put it.  Sarah Westwood, thanks very much.  </p><p> With Congressional leadership gone until the new year, both Democrats and Republicans have basically decided that figuring out how to fund the government is a 2019 problem.  CNN's Phil Mattingly has more on where those negotiations are.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  As the partial government shutdown rolls into its first week of completion, the reality is this -- here on Capitol Hill, down at the White House, there is no solution in sight.  Democrats, they firmly stand behind their position.  They are not willing to give a dollar for the president's border wall.  The president has made clear, a border wall, border fence, border structure of some kind, is basically mandatory for him to sign off on any deal to reopen the government.</p><p> So where does that leave things?  Well, at this point, lawmakers and aides here on Capitol Hill say they're looking into next week. They're looking into 2019, they're looking into the moment on January 3rd where Democrats retake control of the House for the first action of any kind legislatively to try and reopen the government.  </p><p> Here's the catch.  That action doesn't necessarily portend a reopening of the government.  Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, has made clear she is going to move several funding proposals to reopen the government, basically kick them over to the Senate.  But in the Senate where Senate Republicans still control things, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear he is not willing to move forward on anything regardless of what House Democrats send over until he knows the president will sign it.  And the president has made clear, what the Democrats are going to send from the House, $1.3 billion in border security money, no money for a border wall, is not acceptable to him.  </p><p> So where does that leave things?  It really is an open question, and nobody has a great answer right now.  On the rank and file level, there are people talking about various proposals that might be able to get lawmakers and the president out of this, but until one or both sides moves off their currently entrenched position, there is no end in sight.  And that matters because this isn't just lawmakers.  It isn't just the president.  It is also federal workers -- 800,000 workers will be working without pay or they will be furloughed.  They will start missing their first paychecks on January 11th.  That is real pain.  That is a real bite to people.  And that is often what triggers lawmakers to come to the table and make a deal.   That said, everybody that I'm talking to on Capitol Hill says pretty plainly, don't look at this as a days-long shutdown at this point. You might need to consider it a weeks-long shutdown.  </p><p> Phil Mattingly, CNN, Capitol Hill.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  Thank you, Phil.  </p><p> That is the real problem here.  Let's bring in Democratic strategist Keith Boykin who is a former Clinton White House aide, and Ben Ferguson host of \"The Ben Ferguson Show.\"  We've heard stories from federal workers who can't pay for the rent, they can't medical expenses even, one heartbreaking one about a tombstone to bury a loved one.  So Ben, what is the message that the president is sending to nearly 800,000 federal workers?  </p><p> [14:05:06] BEN FERGUSON, HOST, \"THE BEN FERGUSON SHOW\":  Look, I think the message should be, not just from the president, but from Democrats, you need to get in the same room, you need to not leave Washington, and you need to get this done.  And it seems pretty clear that Democrats have left town and the president is still there.  They should be working on this.  The Democratic leadership should not be on vacation right now while they're telling these stories that you just mentioned.  They should be sitting there, they should be meeting at the White House, they should be having discussions.  </p><p> The unfortunate reality is nothing is going to get done until Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House on the 3rd and when they come back to their normal business hours.  They're on vacation.  That matters to them more than being in Washington working for the American people, and I'm glad at least the president is willing to stay in Washington and say let's talk it out, let's have these meetings.  There should be no New Year's parties at any of these people, lawmakers, should be going to.  Unfortunately, they all said my vacation is more important than the American people, the taxpayers, and the government workers.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Keith, what about that?  Because there is something to what is being said here, that you have 800,000 people, who are facing real uncertainty and crises in their lives as a result of this political divide, and the Democrats, yes, they're not in town, they're not there, and they've gone home.  </p><p> KEITH BOYKIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, this is a tragedy, 800,000 people, federal government employees, who are without jobs or who are working without pay.  This is a problem that the Republican Congress created with a Republican president.  Remember, the Democrats do not control the government.  They have not controlled any branch of government for the past two years.  This is the entire problem of the Republican-controlled Congress, and they won't until January 3.  So the idea of blaming Democrats for something that Trump couldn't do himself in two years which he had in office, is preposterous.  Not to mention the fact that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are down in Palm Beach at Mar-a-Lago frolicking around Florida.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  They're not congressman.  They're not senators.  They are not elected officials.  That's a cheap talking point.  </p><p> BOYKIN:  They are White House aides.  They are White House aides.  And the only reason this is a crisis is because Donald Trump refused to tell the truth to the American people that Mexico was not going to pay for this wall.  And he refused to get his own Republican Congress to do something for the past two years, to do this.  So now here we are at the 11th hour, and Trump wants the Democrats to bail him out from the campaign lies that he told.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Let me, let me just insert here, Ben.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  I've got to get in here --  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Hold on, Ben, hold on, Ben, hold on.  The president is not wavering when it comes to funding for his wall, and I want you first to list ton what the Democratic representative from Maryland, that's Steny Hoyer, had to say about this.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND:  He made a promise that was an ill- informed, ill-advised promise, and he said to the Mexican people were going to pay for it.  That was baloney.  He should have known it was baloney.  We don't believe the wall is a good technology.  The American people don't think it's a good technology.  There are other ways to keep our borders secure.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  Here's my point, Ben.  The president did make a promise, and Democrats have sort of made a promise that they're not going to give in to him.  There is no give on either side here, and that is really worrisome, especially if you're among the 800,000 without pay.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  Well, again, I look at the president, and if you notice, it is only Democrats that are talking about the -- and it is a talking point, it's trying to hit the president, for him saying Mexico is going to build the wall.  If you talk to Republicans, they have no problem funding it.  That's why there are GoFundMe pages with tens of millions of dollars coming in days before Christmas that are very concerned.  </p><p> The idea that a border wall doesn't work, there's a lot of places, El Paso is a great example where they put up barriers and it had a huge impact on reducing the number of illegal crossings.  You talk to Border Patrol agents, they say it would have a massive impact if they have this wall there.  And the president won on the promise of building the wall.  The American people voted him in as president of the United States of America, this is his core campaign issue.  He has not backed down from it, he hasn't flinched on.  The American people believe that border security is important.</p><p> And I will say it again, if Democrats want to lead on this issue, and they're going to sit out there and tell people they feel sorry for these workers that aren't going to get their paychecks, then you shouldn't be on vacation.  And you're about to be --  SAVIDGE:  OK, we've gone over that, Ben.  Keith, let me ask you this.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  Get your butt back to Washington.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  There is a shift here that the White House is doing, and that is the president very proudly said, look, if there is going to be a government shutdown, I'll own.  But there now seems to be a shift on the part of the White House in which the blame is being placed upon Representative Nancy Pelosi, who soon will be the speaker of the House.  So do you think that strategy works?  </p><p> BOYKIN:  No, it's ridiculous.  Donald Trump campaigned by saying I alone can fix it.  Remember, he said this repeatedly, that he knew Washington better than anyone else.  He was going to fix the problems. He was going to get everybody in a room and sit them down and negotiate.  </p><p> [14:10:02] I'll remind you, he has a Republican Congress that is still in charge for the rest of this year and until January 3rd.  He can't even get his Republican Congress to pass the border wall that he wants to pass.  He hasn't been able to do this for two years.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  They already did in the House.  It is a Senate issue.  </p><p> BOYKIN:  And now he wants the Democrats to bail him out for a campaign promise --</p><p> FERGUSON:  Keith, you can't re-write history.  </p><p> BOYKIN:  -- that he made that was a lie from the very beginning.  It was a lie from the very beginning.</p><p> FERGUSON:  Keith, they already voted thon in the House.  </p><p> BOYKIN:  And he said, who is going to pay for it, and the crowd repeatedly Mexico.  They didn't say the American taxpayers.  They said Mexico.  That was a lie.  And he should pay for it.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Then let me ask you this.  The president is threatening to shut down the southern border.  He is upping the ante in what is already a very problematic battle of political wills.  Is that going to work?  And do you think he really means it?  </p><p> FERGUSON:  I think the president is dead serious about this issue, and it is a national security issue, it's an American worker and protecting American workers and jobs and wages issue.  And I think the president has realized that it is his duty and obligation to go all in on this issue and to figure out and to broker the best deal possible. At the end of the day there's going to have to be -- </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Shut down the border, the financial impact alone, though, that would that be?  </p><p> FERGUSON:  Again, it is a question of, if you look at only the financial impact, any massive change in American history usually is pretty tough to do.  And the president understands that.  And to do anything big in Washington, unfortunately, there's always going to be, well, what about this, or what about that?  You look at this police officer that was killed in California on Christmas Eve.  I think the president looks at the illegal immigrant that killed him and said why is this person in this country illegally?  How is he able to cross the border at will whenever he wants to?  I am going to protect the American people.  This is my promise, and everything is on the table, to get this done.  And I support the president in doing that.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  All right, Keith, what will it take to come up with a compromise, because it is going to have to be one, to get this government open again and people paid?  </p><p> BOYKIN:  Unfortunately, it seems the only solution is for Democrats to take control of the House on January 3rd, and then finally Trump will realize he can't get his border wall done and he will go back to a reasonable negotiating position.  I don't see anything changing before that.  </p><p> But the story just came out today in the \"New York Daily News\" that Trump's own golf course in New Jersey has been apparently handing out fraudulent green cards and Social Security numbers to people at his golf club.  So he is the most hypocritical person in the country when he talks about the impact of illegal immigration on the economy in this country.  Donald Trump has been inconsistent on this issue from the beginning.  He lied about Mexico.  He is lying about the border wall.  And he is the only one that is keeping the government shutdown. </p><p> FERGUSON:  How is he lying about the border wall?  </p><p> BOYKIN:  He is the one who is keeping the government shutdown.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  How is he lying about the border wall?  He has been consistent about that.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Then what's the solution?  What's the solution from your point of view?  </p><p> BOYKIN:  He lied when he said he wouldn't blame the Democrats, and now he's blaming Nancy Pelosi for what he himself has done.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  Nancy Pelosi is not in town.  If you've got to have a deal done, you have to have a deal done with the Democrats.</p><p> BOYKIN:  She is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  Keith, you know that.  You worked in the White House, for goodness sake.</p><p> BOYKIN:  She is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  She is about to be.  She takes the job.  You know this. This is the part that is absurd.  </p><p> BOYKIN:  Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p> FERGUSON:  She is about to be the speaker of the House.  She just started ahead of time.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Thanks very much for joining us, Ben Ferguson, thank you very much, we appreciate both of you for joining in on the conversation.  And we hope that a solution is found soon.  We'll have you back in the new year.  Thanks.  </p><p> And in the midst of this government shutdown, it is very easy to forget about the tens of thousands of families affected.  It is not just politics.  I spoke to one government worker earlier today about how the shutdown is impacting her.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  If you could, you have the opportunity, right now, to speak directly to lawmakers, what would you say to them?  </p><p> LILA JOHNSON, FEDERAL CONTRACT EMPLOYEE:  I will say they should come to some kind of a decision, because people like me, is struggling, working, it is hard on us.  And for President Trump to be throwing a temper about a wall, the American people, I didn't ask for it.  That's something that he promised the people when he was elected.  Why should we have to pay for it?  And this should come to some kind of agreement to open the government back up so people like me, my coworkers, and everybody else can go back to work.  We are working people.  We don't need to be standing on the line for them up on the Hill, in the White House, wherever, fighting over when is they going to open the government back up?  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Can I ask you, how much longer can you get by with this shutdown?  Or is it already to the point where it's almost desperate?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  It is to the point now.  It's not about how much longer. It's to the point now that I need to be working to pay my bills and take care of my family.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [14:15:06] SAVIDGE:  Still ahead, the Trump administration still laser-focused on the border.  Now, we're learning new details of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's latest trip.  We'll take you live to El Paso.  </p><p> Plus, later, a hotel guest kicked out while talking on the phone in the lobby.  Now the hotel is responding after a nationwide backlash. We'll tell you what their decision is after this.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  We're following new developments in the California case, where more arrests have been made after a police officer Ronil Singh was gunned down the day after Christmas during a traffic stop. Authorities now have arrested the girlfriend and the brother of the suspect, that is Gustavo Perez Arriaga.  Police arrested Arriaga Friday, and they say that he was in the U.S. legally and he might have been trying to escape to Mexico.  CNN national correspondent Sara Sidner has more on that arrest.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Less than 48 hours after losing his brother, his hero, his friend, Reggie Singh stepped to the mics.  He had just learned his brother's suspected killer had been caught.  </p><p> REGGIE SINGH, VICTIM'S BROTHER:  He is not coming back, but there's a lot of people out there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't know that work days and nights to make this happen.  </p><p> SIDNER:  Ronil Singh came to this country as an immigrant from Fiji. He was living his version of the American dream.  He wanted to become a police officer, and he did just that.  He dreamt of a family.  Five months ago, he and his wife welcomed their son into the world.  But at 1:00 in the morning, the day after Christmas, Singh's dream abruptly ended.  </p><p> [14:20:00] CHIEF RANDY RICHARD, NEWMAN POLICE:  I did not know Christmas morning at 4:00 in the morning when I said goodbye to him and sent him off to his family that it would be the last time that I saw him.  </p><p> SIDNER:  Police say Singh was killed by Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who, unlike Singh, had come into the country illegally.  Deputies caught up with Arriaga at a home near Bakersfield, California, after a massive manhunt.  </p><p> SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY:  This criminal, Mr. Arriaga, crossed our border illegally into Arizona some time ago.  He is a criminal.  He has two prior arrests for DUI.  </p><p> SIDNER:  Several people were arrested, including Arriaga's brother and a co-worker, who were accused of lying to authorities and impeding their ability to find him faster.  While Singh's family wept around him, the Stanislaus County sheriff could not contain his outrage over California's so-called sanctuary law.  </p><p> CHRISTIANSON:  And under SB-54 in California, based on two arrests for DUI and some other active warrants that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this criminal gang member.  </p><p> SIDNER:  Some law enforcement officials completely disagreed, saying the law actually encourages people to come forward who would otherwise avoid helping law enforcement because of citizenship status.  But the sheriff's sentiment has been embraced by others, including the man with the largest megaphone.  President Trump tweeted about the case, using it in his pitched battle to build a border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  </p><p> No matter who wins the political battle, there is little that can ease the pain of the Singh family.  Their one small solace, Singh's canine partner Sam will simply become the family pet.  The police department is retiring the dog because, as the chief put it, the Singh family shouldn't have to lose another family member.   Sara Sidner, CNN, Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  On another story, two hotel employees in Portland, Oregon, have been fired after they were caught on video calling the police on a black guest who was talking on his phone.  Jermaine Massey says that he was racially profiled while in the lobby of the Portland DoubleTree hotel.  He says he was a guest at the hotel and he was approached by hotel employees who doubted his explanation that he was a guest.  The security guard eventually called the police on him.  Massey shot video of the incident on his cell phone, and, yes, the encounter soon went viral.  </p><p> For more on, let's bring in CNN's Miguel Marquez.  And Miguel, what more can you tell us about the development?  </p><p> MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This seems to be another example of a situation where you have white individuals who, for whatever reason, call the police on black individuals doing fairly minor things, if anything concerning at all, essentially breathing while black.  </p><p> Mr. Massey checked in on December 22nd into that DoubleTree hotel, it's part of the Hilton chain.  The two employees that you see in the video have been fired.  He had come back from a concert that night, he had a text from his mother to call, he stopped in the lobby, there was a lot of people in there so he went off to a quieter part of the lobby.  That's when he had the encounter with this security guard.  He put it all on social media, as one does these days, and we took some of the highlights of it to show you sort of how that conversation went.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JERMAINE MASSEY, SAYS HOTEL STAFF HARASSED HIM, HAD HIM KICKED OUT: He's calling the cops on me because I'm taking a phone call at the DoubleTree Hotel.  Say hi, Earl.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Portland police will be here in a minute.  </p><p> MASSEY:  Thank you.  Call them.  I'm waiting.  They're coming why? Why are they coming?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To escort you off the property.  </p><p> MASSEY:  Because what, and I'm staying here?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not anymore.  </p><p> MASSEY:  How am I loitering in an area that's public?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're sitting here.</p><p> MASSEY:  So this area is off limits after a certain time?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Only if you're a guest.  </p><p> MASSEY:  I am a guest.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You didn't tell me that.  </p><p> MASSEY:  I said that I'm a guest.  I told you that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARQUEZ:  Now, the Portland mayor in a tweet referred to this as part of the systemic nature of discrimination.  Portland police eventually did show up, escorted Mr. Massey to his room, and then out of the hotel.  The hotel has apologized.  They have investigated and now fired those two employees.</p><p> But Mr. Massy and his lawyer, they want more.  They want something in writing from DoubleTree hotel, or the Hilton chain, explaining why was he approached, what are the rules in these circumstances, and let individuals know if they are going to make a private phone call in a public lobby, and they are staying there, what is it that would engender that sort of attention from a security guard, and then to have it escalate to the point where they're kicked out of their room by that time about midnight on the 23rd.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  And unbelievable story.  And thank goodness he rolled on all of it.  Miguel Marquez, thank you very much for that.  </p><p> MARQUEZ:  You got it.  </p><p> [14:25:00] SAVIDGE:  And we'll be right back.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  Major developments in North Carolina that could impact the future of a congressional seat there.  The North Carolina state board of elections dissolved Friday without certifying results from the ninth congressional district, which shows Republican Mark Harris ahead by just 905 votes over Democrat Dan MccReady.  The prospects for a new election are now pretty much in doubt for a race that was tainted by allegations of ballot fraud by a Republican operative.  </p><p> Adding to the uncertainty, the incoming House majority leader says House Democrats will not allow the Republican candidate to be sworn in next week because of the ongoing investigation.  </p><p> For more on all of this, let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes.  And Kristen, what is going to happen next?  </p><p> KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Martin, that is the big question.  And it's just as complicated as it is messy.  So the board of elections dissolved.  This was at the order of a panel of state judges who deemed it unconstitutional.  And this is from an ongoing legal battle from 2016.  But it has huge implications for what is going on right now within the state.  </p><p> Not only was the board of elections running the investigation into whether or not there was potential ballot fraud.  They were also holding a hearing January 11th to go over the evidence from that investigation, and essentially decide whether or not there was going to be a new election.  </p><p> Now, in addition to that, as you mentioned, they never certified a winner in this election.  Harris did try to make a last-ditch effort on Friday, right before the board dissolved, trying to get certified as the winner.  They rebuffed him.  Now, he plans to take this to federal court to force them to certify him as the winner.  So we'll have to see what happens with that.  </p><p> But what this all means moving forward, well, first, take a look at Congress.  We know that Congress is set to start, all of those new members are going to be sworn in on January 3rd.  </p><p> [14:30:04] And Harris doesn't really have a legal leg to stand on despite the fact that he was in the lead.  Without a court order, and without certification, there is no legal authority that says that he should get the seat.  But in addition to that, if he were to show up, let's say, and try to claim the seat, Democrats say they are going to fight against this tooth and nail.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND:  His election has not been certified. In light of that, and in light of the fact that so many Republicans in North Carolina admit and observe that there was fraud, obviously, conducted in the general election in North Carolina, in that district, that he should not be seated unless the cloud is lifted.  My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOLMES:  So how that's going to happen we just don't know, because right now there is no board of elections.  But moving forward with the investigation, that is a whole other mess here.  So Democratic Governor Roy Cooper under a new state law is required to appoint a new board of elections.  Now, this is supposed to be done on January 31st. So he has said that he will appoint an interim board of elections to continue with this investigation.  Republicans now say not so fast. They claim Cooper does not have the authority to do that.  And now they're saying they will take this to court if they have to.  So this could be tied up for quite some time, Martin.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  As you said, Kristen, messy and complicated.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  </p><p> A new threat from the Kremlin.  Russia claims its new supersonic missile is in vulnerable and it's all set to go.  What does this mean for our national security?  We'll have more on that right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  Russia says that it has a new hypersonic missile system and that it will enter service next year.   [14:35:01] Russian president Vladimir Putin claims it's invulnerable to U.S. defenses after a test of the missile Wednesday.  Putin says it is a wonderful gift to the country for the new year.  CNN's Barbara Starr has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  U.S. defense officials say this is the real deal.  Russia test-firing its new high speed, hypersonic missile, a missile that the U.S. military currently cannot defend against.  Russian President Vladimir Putin pulling no punches on his intent.  </p><p> VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, (through translator):  The new avant-garde missile system is invincible against today's and future air and missile defense systems of the potential enemy.  This is a big success and a great achievement.  </p><p> COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  If the weapons work as advertised, there is no current defense against them.  </p><p> STARR:  The Russian missile has captured the attention of Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary who will take over as acting Pentagon chief when Secretary James Mattis leaves next week.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a number of options going on with hypersonic missiles.  </p><p> STARR:  Shanahan warns the U.S. needs to be able to detect the fast- flying missile, much further away than current radar systems can handle.  The U.S. has to detect it thousands, not hundreds of miles away, because of its high-speed approach.  The Pentagon may spend more than $1 billion trying to develop and field its own capabilities.  </p><p> The Russians are making significant, yet unproven claims, about their missiles, saying it's capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, it flies up to 20 times faster than the speed of sound, it can adjust altitude and direction to avoid detection.  Putin says it's invincible.  </p><p> GEN. JOHN HYTEN, COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. STRATEGIC COMMAND:  We are going to need a different set of sensors in order to see the hypersonic threats.  Our adversaries know that.  </p><p> STARR:  The challenges are also political for President Trump whose relationship with Russian president Putin has been rocky since July's Helsinki summit.  </p><p> LEIGHTON:  Putin feels incredibly emboldened.  Putin believes this is the time to press his advantage.  He's put his forces in Ukraine, in eastern Ukraine.  He's of course taking over Crimea.  He's now gaining ground in Syria.  This is Russia's time, in his view.  </p><p> STARR:  U.S. defense officials are taking no chances on whether the Russian system works, or it does not.  They say they are proceeding with a U.S. program to try and match and overmatch whatever the Russians may be up to.   Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  And still ahead, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen visits the U.S. border with Mexico.  Now we're learning new details about her trip.  More on that, after this.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [14:41:36] SAVIDGE:  2018 was a pivotal year for business, many once dominant bricks and mortar retailers shuttered their doors while Amazon expanded and continues to command e-commerce sales, making its founder and CEO the richest man on the planet.  CNN's business editor at large Richard Quest and chief business correspondent Christine Romans break down the top eight business stories of 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Iconic American industries transformed.  </p><p> RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR AT LARGE:  The stock market's wild ride.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The U.S. takes on the world.  </p><p> QUEST:  Scandals shake confidence in big tech.  </p><p> ROMANS:  These are the top business stories of 2018.  </p><p> QUEST:  Number eight, retail implodes as Amazon explodes.  This year, two decades-old iconic American retailers closed up shop.  </p><p> JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  The dramatic fall for what used to be one of the United States largest retailers, Sears filing for bankruptcy.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a Toys R Us kid.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The last generation of Toys R Us kids have spoken across the U.S., all of its stores will now close.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Toys R Us and Sears struggled to keep up with retail's digital transformation.  Stores like Target, Macy's, and WalMart are investing millions in their websites and mobile apps.  The goal -- compete with Amazon.  The online behemoth dominates the industry with billion-dollar profits and $1 trillion market value, granting its CEO a coveted title.  </p><p> QUEST:  Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all time.  </p><p> Two new locations will feel Amazon's power, New York City and northern Virginia.  They won a year-long competition for it second headquarters.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Number seven, auto companies reckon with the future. Americans are shunning sedans for SUVs.  And that's changing the industry.  Ford will drop all but two passenger cars from its lineup by the year 2020.  And General Motors is restructuring its work force, an announcement that sent shockwaves through America's heartland and Washington.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  General Motors, the iconic American automaker, is cutting staff, and closing plants.  </p><p> ROMANS:  President Trump slammed GM's decision to shutter five north American factory, costing 14,000 jobs.  But U.S. automakers say it's evolve or die.  They are investing in self driving and electric cars to compete with each other, and their new rivals in Silicon Valley.  </p><p> QUEST:  Number six, Trump versus the Federal Reserve.  In 2017, President Trump praised his pick for Fed chief.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He's strong.  He's committed.  He's smart.  </p><p> QUEST:  While that didn't last long.  The president breaking precedent by repeatedly criticizing Jerome Powell for raising interest rates.  </p><p> TRUMP:  The Fed is out of control.  I'm not happy with what he's doing.  </p><p> We have much more of a fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else.  </p><p> QUEST:  Historically, presidents always avoid confront can the central bank.  It's supposed to operate independently from political influence.  So President Trump's attacks may have unintended consequences.  If the Fed suddenly slows the pace of rate hikes, that could raise concern, bowing to political pressure.  Or the president could do exactly the opposite of what he intended.  The Fed may feel it has to raise rates to show its not surrendering.  </p><p> [14:45:08] ROMANS:  Number five, Elon Musk's erratic behavior cost Tesla and himself.  Many credit Tesla's incredible market value to belief in Musk as an innovator, but this year his actions caused many to question his leadership, like slamming analysts on an investor call.  </p><p> ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  Boring, bonehead questions are not cool. Next.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Smoking marijuana during a live broadcast.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's Tobacco and marijuana there.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Calling a British cave diver involved in the Thai soccer team rescue a pedophile.  And of course the fiasco over potentially taking Tesla private, Musk stunned investors in August when he tweeted he had secured funding to take the company private, a plan he has since abandoned.  That triggered a jump in Tesla's stock price as well as scrutiny from Wall Street's top regulator.  The SEC concluded Musk misled investigators, forcing him to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman to settle those charges.  </p><p> QUEST:  It is number four, Wall Street's wild swing.  Now 2018 started with a bang.  And then trading turned volatile.  </p><p> WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Happening now, breaking news, wild ride. Another dizzying day on Wall Street, with stocks nose-diving more than 1,000 points for the second time this week.  </p><p> ROMANS:  In February, the Dow lost 3,200 points in just two weeks when inflation fears ramped up.  Stocks recovered, as corporate tax cuts juiced profits.  But then came the tech stock meltdown that dragged the whole market lower.  </p><p> QUEST:  Very scary October in the markets.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Stock market just had its worst month since 2011.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Breaking news.  The Dow plunging more than 500 points yet again.  </p><p> QUEST:  Trade fears, rising interest rates, Brexit chaos, slowing growth, recession concerns, all of them putting strain on a bull market that is already the longest in history.  </p><p> ROMANS:  Number three, President Trump took on the world, turning his tough trade talk into action, slapping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, ripping up NAFTA for the USMCA, and trashing America's neighbor in the process.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Canada has treated us very badly.  We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.  </p><p> ROMANS:  But what really unsettled investors, a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The president announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  China shot right back, saying it will retaliate with countermeasures.  </p><p> ROMANS:  China and the U.S. hit each other with tariffs on billions of dollars of goods.  President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary trade truce in December.  Investors hope that could lead to the real deal.  But that could be complicated by the recent arrest of the CFO of a Chinese tech giant in Canada.  </p><p> Number two, unemployment hit historic lows.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's 3.7 percent unemployment in the month of September, a 49-year low.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The U.S. labor market is strong, adding jobs for the past 98 months in a row.  But as the U.S. nears what is known as full employment, employers will struggle to find workers.  Hiring may slow. But for now, job gains are solid and wages finally started to rise, a missing piece of the recovery so far.   QUEST:  Number one -- Facebook scandals which sowed distrust in big tech.  In march Facebook revealed it had exposed 87 million users to a third party app that angered users, advertisers, lawmakers, and investors.  </p><p> ROMANS:  The data crisis was a hit to Facebook's reputation, already tarnished for its role in spreading misinformation and allowing election meddling.  It led to an apology tour for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, concluding with a grilling on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I started Facebook.  I run.  And at the end of the day, I am responsible for what happens here.  </p><p> QUEST:  Facebook promised to spend billions to put privacy first. Users liked that.  Investors didn't.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook just suffered the biggest single day loss for any public company in history.  </p><p> QUEST:  In one day, Facebook lost $119 billion in market value. Tackling its problems will cut into Facebook's profits for years to come.  But the company says it's necessary to improve its platform and regain our trust.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  And there's much more ahead in the newsroom.  But first, at nine years old, she was severely burned in a kitchen accident.  Now she is a popular beauty blogger inspiring others.  Her story is today's Turning Point.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [14:50:00] SHALOM BLAC, BEAUTY VLOGGER:  I am Shalom Blac.  I am a beauty and inspirational vlogger on YouTube.  </p><p> I do transformation videos.  That is what people really know for me. The thing that really separate me from everyone else that does YouTube videos is my scars.  </p><p> I am from Nigeria, and I got burned when I was nine-years-old at my mother's restaurant.  The pan of oil just literally fell on me and my youngest sister.  I'm not sure exactly how many surgeries I got.  Life took a huge, huge turn for me.  I didn't want to go to school, and everybody would sort of look at me and felt disgusted.  I started thinking about committing suicide, because of the bullying.  </p><p> When I moved here, I got introduced to proper makeup in the hospital. But then I came across YouTube videos.  </p><p> I started applying that to how I wanted my makeup to look.  And I started getting e-mails and DM's, just people telling me how I inspire them, how they are willing to challenge themselves and face their fears.  </p><p> I don't feel any different, whether I have makeup or not.  I'm very, very much in tune with my looks.  I see beauty regardless.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [14:55:05] SAVIDGE:  Today, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is in Yuma, Arizona, for a firsthand look at the Customs and Border Protection facilities there.  This comes one day after Nielsen made pretty much the same kind of visit in El Paso yesterday.  The secretary issuing this statement just minutes ago, and it reads in part, \"The system is clearly overwhelmed, and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable populations. We know that if Congress were to act, or the courts were to enforce the law as written, we could address this crisis tomorrow.  Instead, we continue to do more with less.  As I have said before, I asked Congress to please put politics aside and recognize this for the growing security and humanitarian crisis it is,\" unquote.  </p><p> Earlier, I speak to the mayor of El Paso about those facilities, what a border shutdown would do to the community, and what caused the unnoticed drop-off of hundreds of migrants in El Paso.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> MAYOR DEE MARGO, (R) EL PASO, TEXAS:  I agree with the statement she released related to the broken immigration policy.  That's the problem.  El Paso is dealing with the symptoms as a result of the lack of fortitude in Washington to deal with, on both sides of the aisle, to deal with our immigration policy.  </p><p> We are being inundated.  We've got five times the release of migrants here since October than we had a year ago.  We're averaging about 2,000 a week.  And I got word yesterday that -- actually this morning, that they may have to increase the releases up to 500 a day, and I'm not sure we can handle that.  And Annunciation House, our primary NGO, they are the ones that coordinate this with 20 other shelters, but I'm not sure we can handle it.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  And Mayor, let me ask you this.  How do your community, your city's resources, come into play, with what is a federal issue?  Is it not?  </p><p> MARGO:  It is.  And that's part of the problem.  You can't apply for disaster relief when the federal government is causing the problem to begin with.  We're looking at whatever we can do.  </p><p> But right now, the NGO, the Annunciation House, takes in donations and handles it, and they're doing a magnificent job of doing that.  The city provides security.  Our bus system, our metro provides transportation for the migrants to the shelters, and we will use our -- and our office of emergency management is coordinating everything. But we will also use our ambulances, et cetera, if it's required for these medical checks that have been increased as a result of he tragic death of the two young Guatemalans.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  From your vantage point --   MARGO:  We've been doing whatever we've been asked to do.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  From your vantage point, and as a community leader, what did you stress to the secretary that needed to be done immediately.  </p><p> MARGO:  We clarified the problem you announced on Christmas Day that occurred a week ago Sunday, with was the lack of analysis, the lack of information.  We're told that our agreement, the Annunciation House's agreement with ICE and CBP is that they will give us at least a 24- hour notice on the releases, and how many.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Why didn't that happen?  Do you know?  Did she explain?  </p><p> MARGO:  I think it was just an unfortunate glitch.  This is one time it happened.  We talked about that.  It didn't look willful or intentional.  It was just an unfortunate glitch in communication.  But I get a text message usually every day announcing the number that are going to be released.  And the Annunciation House talks about where they are going to be sheltered.  </p><p> But we've got this issue.  It is continuing.  We're the second largest port.  We're receiving these, as I say, daily.  As I've said on previous interviews with CNN and other networks, is you want to know about immigration, and you want to know about the border, come to El Paso.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  And I agree with you.  I've been down there and that that is the place that you see it firsthand.  </p><p> MARGO:  -- the U.S.-Mexican border.</p><p> SAVIDGE:  Let me ask you before we run out of time and I'm sorry to interrupt, but the president has threatened a shutdown of the southern border.  How would that impact your community?  </p><p> MARGO:  It would be a killer.  We have, in addition to the migrant community that we're dealing with, and that issue, it's commerce. We've got 23,000 pedestrians, legal pedestrians, that cross every day north from Mexico.  We have commerce trucks back and forth.  We have 21 million private passenger vehicles on an annual basis that come north legally.  So from a commerce stand point, we're the 10th largest port in the nation.  We got $82 billion going back and forth in imports and exports.  It would be a killer.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAVIDGE:  And we will see if the president makes good on that threat. Thank you for joining me.  I'm Martin Savidge.

As the stalemate drags on, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are either sitting at home wondering when they will be paid or are working without pay, like, say, TSA agents. And now the president is threatening a shutdown of another kind, a full one, at the southern border if he doesn't get the funding for his wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Sarah Westwood is at the White House. And Sarah, we understand that the president is in Washington, but all the key players are gone until next year, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right, Martin. President Trump is alone here at the White House and increasingly frustrated with his inability to get funding for his promised border wall, and he has been continuing to blame Democrats for the persistence of the partial government shutdown, even though just a couple of weeks ago, recall that he said he would be proud to own any shutdown if it was in pursuit of money for his border wall.</p><p>Now, despite that tweet and several others blaming Democrats for this shutdown, incoming acting chief of staff/budget director Mick Mulvaney says Congressional Democrats haven't actually been invited to the White House for further talks. Mulvaney said the White House is now just waiting on a counteroffer from Democrats, because recall that last week Vice President Mike Pence went to Capitol Hill and offered support for a border security package plus wall funding worth about $2.5 billion. That's an offer that Democrats rejected, so talks remain at a standstill.</p><p>The president taking to Twitter this morning, wrote, \"I am in the White House, waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security. From what I hear, they are spending too much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military.\" Now, \"presidential harassment\" is the term the president has used for the investigations and oversight Democrats have promised when they come into the House majority in just five days, and that's key because the president and other White House officials have continuously blamed Nancy Pelosi, the likely next House speaker, for holding up talks. They claim that she can't accept any kind of compromise before her speakership race on January 3rd or she will put that speaker's gavel at risk.</p><p>The president hasn't only been focused on the shutdown. He also had a call earlier today with the Chinese president Xi Jinping about trade as a possible trade deal with China also hangs in the balance, Martin. So a lot on his plate on this Saturday afternoon.</p><p>SAVIDGE: A lot going on at the White House for a Saturday, just as you put it. Sarah Westwood, thanks very much.</p><p>With Congressional leadership gone until the new year, both Democrats and Republicans have basically decided that figuring out how to fund the government is a 2019 problem. CNN's Phil Mattingly has more on where those negotiations are.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As the partial government shutdown rolls into its first week of completion, the reality is this -- here on Capitol Hill, down at the White House, there is no solution in sight. Democrats, they firmly stand behind their position. They are not willing to give a dollar for the president's border wall. The president has made clear, a border wall, border fence, border structure of some kind, is basically mandatory for him to sign off on any deal to reopen the government.</p><p>So where does that leave things? Well, at this point, lawmakers and aides here on Capitol Hill say they're looking into next week. They're looking into 2019, they're looking into the moment on January 3rd where Democrats retake control of the House for the first action of any kind legislatively to try and reopen the government.</p><p>Here's the catch. That action doesn't necessarily portend a reopening of the government. Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, has made clear she is going to move several funding proposals to reopen the government, basically kick them over to the Senate. But in the Senate where Senate Republicans still control things, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear he is not willing to move forward on anything regardless of what House Democrats send over until he knows the president will sign it. And the president has made clear, what the Democrats are going to send from the House, $1.3 billion in border security money, no money for a border wall, is not acceptable to him.</p><p>So where does that leave things? It really is an open question, and nobody has a great answer right now. On the rank and file level, there are people talking about various proposals that might be able to get lawmakers and the president out of this, but until one or both sides moves off their currently entrenched position, there is no end in sight. And that matters because this isn't just lawmakers. It isn't just the president. It is also federal workers -- 800,000 workers will be working without pay or they will be furloughed. They will start missing their first paychecks on January 11th. That is real pain. That is a real bite to people. And that is often what triggers lawmakers to come to the table and make a deal. That said, everybody that I'm talking to on Capitol Hill says pretty plainly, don't look at this as a days-long shutdown at this point. You might need to consider it a weeks-long shutdown.</p><p>Phil Mattingly, CNN, Capitol Hill.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Thank you, Phil.</p><p>That is the real problem here. Let's bring in Democratic strategist Keith Boykin who is a former Clinton White House aide, and Ben Ferguson host of \"The Ben Ferguson Show.\" We've heard stories from federal workers who can't pay for the rent, they can't medical expenses even, one heartbreaking one about a tombstone to bury a loved one. So Ben, what is the message that the president is sending to nearly 800,000 federal workers?</p><p>[14:05:06] BEN FERGUSON, HOST, \"THE BEN FERGUSON SHOW\": Look, I think the message should be, not just from the president, but from Democrats, you need to get in the same room, you need to not leave Washington, and you need to get this done. And it seems pretty clear that Democrats have left town and the president is still there. They should be working on this. The Democratic leadership should not be on vacation right now while they're telling these stories that you just mentioned. They should be sitting there, they should be meeting at the White House, they should be having discussions.</p><p>The unfortunate reality is nothing is going to get done until Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House on the 3rd and when they come back to their normal business hours. They're on vacation. That matters to them more than being in Washington working for the American people, and I'm glad at least the president is willing to stay in Washington and say let's talk it out, let's have these meetings. There should be no New Year's parties at any of these people, lawmakers, should be going to. Unfortunately, they all said my vacation is more important than the American people, the taxpayers, and the government workers.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Keith, what about that? Because there is something to what is being said here, that you have 800,000 people, who are facing real uncertainty and crises in their lives as a result of this political divide, and the Democrats, yes, they're not in town, they're not there, and they've gone home.</p><p>KEITH BOYKIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, this is a tragedy, 800,000 people, federal government employees, who are without jobs or who are working without pay. This is a problem that the Republican Congress created with a Republican president. Remember, the Democrats do not control the government. They have not controlled any branch of government for the past two years. This is the entire problem of the Republican-controlled Congress, and they won't until January 3. So the idea of blaming Democrats for something that Trump couldn't do himself in two years which he had in office, is preposterous. Not to mention the fact that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are down in Palm Beach at Mar-a-Lago frolicking around Florida.</p><p>FERGUSON: They're not congressman. They're not senators. They are not elected officials. That's a cheap talking point.</p><p>BOYKIN: They are White House aides. They are White House aides. And the only reason this is a crisis is because Donald Trump refused to tell the truth to the American people that Mexico was not going to pay for this wall. And he refused to get his own Republican Congress to do something for the past two years, to do this. So now here we are at the 11th hour, and Trump wants the Democrats to bail him out from the campaign lies that he told.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Let me, let me just insert here, Ben.</p><p>FERGUSON: I've got to get in here --</p><p>SAVIDGE: Hold on, Ben, hold on, Ben, hold on. The president is not wavering when it comes to funding for his wall, and I want you first to list ton what the Democratic representative from Maryland, that's Steny Hoyer, had to say about this. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND: He made a promise that was an ill- informed, ill-advised promise, and he said to the Mexican people were going to pay for it. That was baloney. He should have known it was baloney. We don't believe the wall is a good technology. The American people don't think it's a good technology. There are other ways to keep our borders secure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Here's my point, Ben. The president did make a promise, and Democrats have sort of made a promise that they're not going to give in to him. There is no give on either side here, and that is really worrisome, especially if you're among the 800,000 without pay.</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, again, I look at the president, and if you notice, it is only Democrats that are talking about the -- and it is a talking point, it's trying to hit the president, for him saying Mexico is going to build the wall. If you talk to Republicans, they have no problem funding it. That's why there are GoFundMe pages with tens of millions of dollars coming in days before Christmas that are very concerned.</p><p>The idea that a border wall doesn't work, there's a lot of places, El Paso is a great example where they put up barriers and it had a huge impact on reducing the number of illegal crossings. You talk to Border Patrol agents, they say it would have a massive impact if they have this wall there. And the president won on the promise of building the wall. The American people voted him in as president of the United States of America, this is his core campaign issue. He has not backed down from it, he hasn't flinched on. The American people believe that border security is important.</p><p>And I will say it again, if Democrats want to lead on this issue, and they're going to sit out there and tell people they feel sorry for these workers that aren't going to get their paychecks, then you shouldn't be on vacation. And you're about to be -- SAVIDGE: OK, we've gone over that, Ben. Keith, let me ask you this.</p><p>FERGUSON: Get your butt back to Washington.</p><p>SAVIDGE: There is a shift here that the White House is doing, and that is the president very proudly said, look, if there is going to be a government shutdown, I'll own. But there now seems to be a shift on the part of the White House in which the blame is being placed upon Representative Nancy Pelosi, who soon will be the speaker of the House. So do you think that strategy works?</p><p>BOYKIN: No, it's ridiculous. Donald Trump campaigned by saying I alone can fix it. Remember, he said this repeatedly, that he knew Washington better than anyone else. He was going to fix the problems. He was going to get everybody in a room and sit them down and negotiate.</p><p>[14:10:02] I'll remind you, he has a Republican Congress that is still in charge for the rest of this year and until January 3rd. He can't even get his Republican Congress to pass the border wall that he wants to pass. He hasn't been able to do this for two years.</p><p>FERGUSON: They already did in the House. It is a Senate issue.</p><p>BOYKIN: And now he wants the Democrats to bail him out for a campaign promise --</p><p>FERGUSON: Keith, you can't re-write history.</p><p>BOYKIN: -- that he made that was a lie from the very beginning. It was a lie from the very beginning.</p><p>FERGUSON: Keith, they already voted thon in the House.</p><p>BOYKIN: And he said, who is going to pay for it, and the crowd repeatedly Mexico. They didn't say the American taxpayers. They said Mexico. That was a lie. And he should pay for it.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Then let me ask you this. The president is threatening to shut down the southern border. He is upping the ante in what is already a very problematic battle of political wills. Is that going to work? And do you think he really means it?</p><p>FERGUSON: I think the president is dead serious about this issue, and it is a national security issue, it's an American worker and protecting American workers and jobs and wages issue. And I think the president has realized that it is his duty and obligation to go all in on this issue and to figure out and to broker the best deal possible. At the end of the day there's going to have to be --</p><p>SAVIDGE: Shut down the border, the financial impact alone, though, that would that be?</p><p>FERGUSON: Again, it is a question of, if you look at only the financial impact, any massive change in American history usually is pretty tough to do. And the president understands that. And to do anything big in Washington, unfortunately, there's always going to be, well, what about this, or what about that? You look at this police officer that was killed in California on Christmas Eve. I think the president looks at the illegal immigrant that killed him and said why is this person in this country illegally? How is he able to cross the border at will whenever he wants to? I am going to protect the American people. This is my promise, and everything is on the table, to get this done. And I support the president in doing that.</p><p>SAVIDGE: All right, Keith, what will it take to come up with a compromise, because it is going to have to be one, to get this government open again and people paid?</p><p>BOYKIN: Unfortunately, it seems the only solution is for Democrats to take control of the House on January 3rd, and then finally Trump will realize he can't get his border wall done and he will go back to a reasonable negotiating position. I don't see anything changing before that.</p><p>But the story just came out today in the \"New York Daily News\" that Trump's own golf course in New Jersey has been apparently handing out fraudulent green cards and Social Security numbers to people at his golf club. So he is the most hypocritical person in the country when he talks about the impact of illegal immigration on the economy in this country. Donald Trump has been inconsistent on this issue from the beginning. He lied about Mexico. He is lying about the border wall. And he is the only one that is keeping the government shutdown.</p><p>FERGUSON: How is he lying about the border wall?</p><p>BOYKIN: He is the one who is keeping the government shutdown.</p><p>FERGUSON: How is he lying about the border wall? He has been consistent about that.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Then what's the solution? What's the solution from your point of view?</p><p>BOYKIN: He lied when he said he wouldn't blame the Democrats, and now he's blaming Nancy Pelosi for what he himself has done.</p><p>FERGUSON: Nancy Pelosi is not in town. If you've got to have a deal done, you have to have a deal done with the Democrats.</p><p>BOYKIN: She is not the speaker of the House.</p><p>FERGUSON: Keith, you know that. You worked in the White House, for goodness sake.</p><p>BOYKIN: She is not the speaker of the House.</p><p>FERGUSON: She is about to be. She takes the job. You know this. This is the part that is absurd.</p><p>BOYKIN: Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of the House.</p><p>FERGUSON: She is about to be the speaker of the House. She just started ahead of time.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Thanks very much for joining us, Ben Ferguson, thank you very much, we appreciate both of you for joining in on the conversation. And we hope that a solution is found soon. We'll have you back in the new year. Thanks.</p><p>And in the midst of this government shutdown, it is very easy to forget about the tens of thousands of families affected. It is not just politics. I spoke to one government worker earlier today about how the shutdown is impacting her. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: If you could, you have the opportunity, right now, to speak directly to lawmakers, what would you say to them?</p><p>LILA JOHNSON, FEDERAL CONTRACT EMPLOYEE: I will say they should come to some kind of a decision, because people like me, is struggling, working, it is hard on us. And for President Trump to be throwing a temper about a wall, the American people, I didn't ask for it. That's something that he promised the people when he was elected. Why should we have to pay for it? And this should come to some kind of agreement to open the government back up so people like me, my coworkers, and everybody else can go back to work. We are working people. We don't need to be standing on the line for them up on the Hill, in the White House, wherever, fighting over when is they going to open the government back up?</p><p>SAVIDGE: Can I ask you, how much longer can you get by with this shutdown? Or is it already to the point where it's almost desperate?</p><p>JOHNSON: It is to the point now. It's not about how much longer. It's to the point now that I need to be working to pay my bills and take care of my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[14:15:06] SAVIDGE: Still ahead, the Trump administration still laser-focused on the border.

Now the hotel is responding after a nationwide backlash. We'll tell you what their decision is after this.</p><p>SAVIDGE: We're following new developments in the California case, where more arrests have been made after a police officer Ronil Singh was gunned down the day after Christmas during a traffic stop. Authorities now have arrested the girlfriend and the brother of the suspect, that is Gustavo Perez Arriaga. Police arrested Arriaga Friday, and they say that he was in the U.S. legally and he might have been trying to escape to Mexico. CNN national correspondent Sara Sidner has more on that arrest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Less than 48 hours after losing his brother, his hero, his friend, Reggie Singh stepped to the mics. He had just learned his brother's suspected killer had been caught.</p><p>REGGIE SINGH, VICTIM'S BROTHER: He is not coming back, but there's a lot of people out there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't know that work days and nights to make this happen.</p><p>SIDNER: Ronil Singh came to this country as an immigrant from Fiji. He was living his version of the American dream. He wanted to become a police officer, and he did just that. He dreamt of a family. Five months ago, he and his wife welcomed their son into the world. But at 1:00 in the morning, the day after Christmas, Singh's dream abruptly ended.</p><p>[14:20:00] CHIEF RANDY RICHARD, NEWMAN POLICE: I did not know Christmas morning at 4:00 in the morning when I said goodbye to him and sent him off to his family that it would be the last time that I saw him.</p><p>SIDNER: Police say Singh was killed by Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who, unlike Singh, had come into the country illegally. Deputies caught up with Arriaga at a home near Bakersfield, California, after a massive manhunt.</p><p>SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY: This criminal, Mr. Arriaga, crossed our border illegally into Arizona some time ago. He is a criminal. He has two prior arrests for DUI.</p><p>SIDNER: Several people were arrested, including Arriaga's brother and a co-worker, who were accused of lying to authorities and impeding their ability to find him faster. While Singh's family wept around him, the Stanislaus County sheriff could not contain his outrage over California's so-called sanctuary law.</p><p>CHRISTIANSON: And under SB-54 in California, based on two arrests for DUI and some other active warrants that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this criminal gang member.</p><p>SIDNER: Some law enforcement officials completely disagreed, saying the law actually encourages people to come forward who would otherwise avoid helping law enforcement because of citizenship status. But the sheriff's sentiment has been embraced by others, including the man with the largest megaphone. President Trump tweeted about the case, using it in his pitched battle to build a border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.</p><p>No matter who wins the political battle, there is little that can ease the pain of the Singh family. Their one small solace, Singh's canine partner Sam will simply become the family pet. The police department is retiring the dog because, as the chief put it, the Singh family shouldn't have to lose another family member. Sara Sidner, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: On another story, two hotel employees in Portland, Oregon, have been fired after they were caught on video calling the police on a black guest who was talking on his phone. Jermaine Massey says that he was racially profiled while in the lobby of the Portland DoubleTree hotel. He says he was a guest at the hotel and he was approached by hotel employees who doubted his explanation that he was a guest. The security guard eventually called the police on him. Massey shot video of the incident on his cell phone, and, yes, the encounter soon went viral.</p><p>For more on, let's bring in CNN's Miguel Marquez. And Miguel, what more can you tell us about the development?</p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This seems to be another example of a situation where you have white individuals who, for whatever reason, call the police on black individuals doing fairly minor things, if anything concerning at all, essentially breathing while black.</p><p>Mr. Massey checked in on December 22nd into that DoubleTree hotel, it's part of the Hilton chain. The two employees that you see in the video have been fired. He had come back from a concert that night, he had a text from his mother to call, he stopped in the lobby, there was a lot of people in there so he went off to a quieter part of the lobby. That's when he had the encounter with this security guard. He put it all on social media, as one does these days, and we took some of the highlights of it to show you sort of how that conversation went.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERMAINE MASSEY, SAYS HOTEL STAFF HARASSED HIM, HAD HIM KICKED OUT: He's calling the cops on me because I'm taking a phone call at the DoubleTree Hotel. Say hi, Earl.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Portland police will be here in a minute.</p><p>MASSEY: Thank you. Call them. I'm waiting. They're coming why? Why are they coming?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To escort you off the property.</p><p>MASSEY: Because what, and I'm staying here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not anymore.</p><p>MASSEY: How am I loitering in an area that's public?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're sitting here.</p><p>MASSEY: So this area is off limits after a certain time?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only if you're a guest.</p><p>MASSEY: I am a guest.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You didn't tell me that.</p><p>MASSEY: I said that I'm a guest. I told you that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUEZ: Now, the Portland mayor in a tweet referred to this as part of the systemic nature of discrimination. Portland police eventually did show up, escorted Mr. Massey to his room, and then out of the hotel. The hotel has apologized. They have investigated and now fired those two employees.</p><p>But Mr. Massy and his lawyer, they want more. They want something in writing from DoubleTree hotel, or the Hilton chain, explaining why was he approached, what are the rules in these circumstances, and let individuals know if they are going to make a private phone call in a public lobby, and they are staying there, what is it that would engender that sort of attention from a security guard, and then to have it escalate to the point where they're kicked out of their room by that time about midnight on the 23rd.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And unbelievable story. And thank goodness he rolled on all of it. Miguel Marquez, thank you very much for that.</p><p>MARQUEZ: You got it.</p><p>[14:25:00] SAVIDGE: And we'll be right back.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Major developments in North Carolina that could impact the future of a congressional seat there. The North Carolina state board of elections dissolved Friday without certifying results from the ninth congressional district, which shows Republican Mark Harris ahead by just 905 votes over Democrat Dan MccReady. The prospects for a new election are now pretty much in doubt for a race that was tainted by allegations of ballot fraud by a Republican operative.</p><p>Adding to the uncertainty, the incoming House majority leader says House Democrats will not allow the Republican candidate to be sworn in next week because of the ongoing investigation.</p><p>For more on all of this, let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes. And Kristen, what is going to happen next?</p><p>KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Martin, that is the big question. And it's just as complicated as it is messy. So the board of elections dissolved. This was at the order of a panel of state judges who deemed it unconstitutional. And this is from an ongoing legal battle from 2016. But it has huge implications for what is going on right now within the state.</p><p>Not only was the board of elections running the investigation into whether or not there was potential ballot fraud. They were also holding a hearing January 11th to go over the evidence from that investigation, and essentially decide whether or not there was going to be a new election.</p><p>Now, in addition to that, as you mentioned, they never certified a winner in this election. Harris did try to make a last-ditch effort on Friday, right before the board dissolved, trying to get certified as the winner. They rebuffed him. Now, he plans to take this to federal court to force them to certify him as the winner. So we'll have to see what happens with that.</p><p>But what this all means moving forward, well, first, take a look at Congress. We know that Congress is set to start, all of those new members are going to be sworn in on January 3rd.</p><p>[14:30:04] And Harris doesn't really have a legal leg to stand on despite the fact that he was in the lead. Without a court order, and without certification, there is no legal authority that says that he should get the seat. But in addition to that, if he were to show up, let's say, and try to claim the seat, Democrats say they are going to fight against this tooth and nail. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND: His election has not been certified. In light of that, and in light of the fact that so many Republicans in North Carolina admit and observe that there was fraud, obviously, conducted in the general election in North Carolina, in that district, that he should not be seated unless the cloud is lifted. My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: So how that's going to happen we just don't know, because right now there is no board of elections. But moving forward with the investigation, that is a whole other mess here. So Democratic Governor Roy Cooper under a new state law is required to appoint a new board of elections. Now, this is supposed to be done on January 31st. So he has said that he will appoint an interim board of elections to continue with this investigation. Republicans now say not so fast. They claim Cooper does not have the authority to do that. And now they're saying they will take this to court if they have to. So this could be tied up for quite some time, Martin.</p><p>SAVIDGE: As you said, Kristen, messy and complicated. Thanks for straightening it out for us.</p><p>A new threat from the Kremlin.

Russian President Vladimir Putin pulling no punches on his intent.</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, (through translator): The new avant-garde missile system is invincible against today's and future air and missile defense systems of the potential enemy.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: If the weapons work as advertised, there is no current defense against them.</p><p>STARR: The Russian missile has captured the attention of Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary who will take over as acting Pentagon chief when Secretary James Mattis leaves next week.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a number of options going on with hypersonic missiles.</p><p>STARR: Shanahan warns the U.S. needs to be able to detect the fast- flying missile, much further away than current radar systems can handle. The U.S. has to detect it thousands, not hundreds of miles away, because of its high-speed approach. The Pentagon may spend more than $1 billion trying to develop and field its own capabilities.</p><p>The Russians are making significant, yet unproven claims, about their missiles, saying it's capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, it flies up to 20 times faster than the speed of sound, it can adjust altitude and direction to avoid detection. Putin says it's invincible.</p><p>GEN. JOHN HYTEN, COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. STRATEGIC COMMAND: We are going to need a different set of sensors in order to see the hypersonic threats. Our adversaries know that.</p><p>STARR: The challenges are also political for President Trump whose relationship with Russian president Putin has been rocky since July's Helsinki summit.</p><p>LEIGHTON: Putin feels incredibly emboldened. Putin believes this is the time to press his advantage. He's put his forces in Ukraine, in eastern Ukraine. He's of course taking over Crimea. He's now gaining ground in Syria. This is Russia's time, in his view.</p><p>STARR: U.S. defense officials are taking no chances on whether the Russian system works, or it does not.

We know that if Congress were to act, or the courts were to enforce the law as written, we could address this crisis tomorrow. Instead, we continue to do more with less.

We've got five times the release of migrants here since October than we had a year ago. We're averaging about 2,000 a week.

And Annunciation House, our primary NGO, they are the ones that coordinate this with 20 other shelters, but I'm not sure we can handle it.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And Mayor, let me ask you this. How do your community, your city's resources, come into play, with what is a federal issue? Is it not?</p><p>MARGO: It is. And that's part of the problem. You can't apply for disaster relief when the federal government is causing the problem to begin with. We're looking at whatever we can do.</p><p>But right now, the NGO, the Annunciation House, takes in donations and handles it, and they're doing a magnificent job of doing that. The city provides security. Our bus system, our metro provides transportation for the migrants to the shelters, and we will use our -- and our office of emergency management is coordinating everything.

We're told that our agreement, the Annunciation House's agreement with ICE and CBP is that they will give us at least a 24- hour notice on the releases, and how many.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Why didn't that happen? Do you know? Did she explain?</p><p>MARGO: I think it was just an unfortunate glitch. This is one time it happened. We talked about that. It didn't look willful or intentional. It was just an unfortunate glitch in communication. But I get a text message usually every day announcing the number that are going to be released. And the Annunciation House talks about where they are going to be sheltered.</p><p>But we've got this issue. It is continuing. We're the second largest port. We're receiving these, as I say, daily. As I've said on previous interviews with CNN and other networks, is you want to know about immigration, and you want to know about the border, come to El Paso.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And I agree with you. I've been down there and that that is the place that you see it firsthand.</p><p>MARGO: -- the U.S.-Mexican border.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Let me ask you before we run out of time and I'm sorry to interrupt, but the president has threatened a shutdown of the southern border. How would that impact your community?</p><p>MARGO: It would be a killer. We have, in addition to the migrant community that we're dealing with, and that issue, it's commerce. We've got 23,000 pedestrians, legal pedestrians, that cross every day north from Mexico. We have commerce trucks back and forth. We have 21 million private passenger vehicles on an annual basis that come north legally. So from a commerce stand point, we're the 10th largest port in the nation. We got $82 billion going back and forth in imports and exports. It would be a killer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: And we will see if the president makes good on that threat. Thank you for joining me. I'm Martin Savidge. The news now continues with Ryan Nobles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018122906CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V36-J1J1-DXH2-611M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7480\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 29, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Race Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Border Procedures</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I3QTk0MDU1RTJFNDQxNkI4QjgxMzA3RTZGNkZCQjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Immigration Officers</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTM0NTNBODQ1Q0FFNDZDREJBRDA0MTgzQTdGQTZEMTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

As the stalemate drags on, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are either sitting at home wondering when they will be paid or are working without pay, like, say, TSA agents.  And now the president is threatening a shutdown of another kind, a full one, at the southern border if he doesn't get the funding for his wall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Sarah Westwood is at the White House.  And Sarah, we understand that the president is in Washington, but all the key players are gone until next year, right?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  That's right, Martin. President Trump is alone here at the White House and increasingly frustrated with his inability to get funding for his promised border wall, and he has been continuing to blame Democrats for the persistence of the partial government shutdown, even though just a couple of weeks ago, recall that he said he would be proud to own any shutdown if it was in pursuit of money for his border wall.  </p><p>Now, despite that tweet and several others blaming Democrats for this shutdown, incoming acting chief of staff/budget director Mick Mulvaney says Congressional Democrats haven't actually been invited to the White House for further talks.  Mulvaney said the White House is now just waiting on a counteroffer from Democrats, because recall that last week Vice President Mike Pence went to Capitol Hill and offered support for a border security package plus wall funding worth about $2.5 billion.  That's an offer that Democrats rejected, so talks remain at a standstill.  </p><p>The president taking to Twitter this morning, wrote, \"I am in the White House, waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security.  From what I hear, they are spending too much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military.\"  Now, \"presidential harassment\" is the term the president has used for the investigations and oversight Democrats have promised when they come into the House majority in just five days, and that's key because the president and other White House officials have continuously blamed Nancy Pelosi, the likely next House speaker, for holding up talks.  They claim that she can't accept any kind of compromise before her speakership race on January 3rd or she will put that speaker's gavel at risk.  </p><p>The president hasn't only been focused on the shutdown.  He also had a call earlier today with the Chinese president Xi Jinping about trade as a possible trade deal with China also hangs in the balance, Martin. So a lot on his plate on this Saturday afternoon.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  A lot going on at the White House for a Saturday, just as you put it.  Sarah Westwood, thanks very much.  </p><p>With Congressional leadership gone until the new year, both Democrats and Republicans have basically decided that figuring out how to fund the government is a 2019 problem.  CNN's Phil Mattingly has more on where those negotiations are.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  As the partial government shutdown rolls into its first week of completion, the reality is this -- here on Capitol Hill, down at the White House, there is no solution in sight.  Democrats, they firmly stand behind their position.  They are not willing to give a dollar for the president's border wall.  The president has made clear, a border wall, border fence, border structure of some kind, is basically mandatory for him to sign off on any deal to reopen the government.</p><p>So where does that leave things?  Well, at this point, lawmakers and aides here on Capitol Hill say they're looking into next week. They're looking into 2019, they're looking into the moment on January 3rd where Democrats retake control of the House for the first action of any kind legislatively to try and reopen the government.  </p><p>Here's the catch.  That action doesn't necessarily portend a reopening of the government.  Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, has made clear she is going to move several funding proposals to reopen the government, basically kick them over to the Senate.  But in the Senate where Senate Republicans still control things, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear he is not willing to move forward on anything regardless of what House Democrats send over until he knows the president will sign it.  And the president has made clear, what the Democrats are going to send from the House, $1.3 billion in border security money, no money for a border wall, is not acceptable to him.  </p><p>So where does that leave things?  It really is an open question, and nobody has a great answer right now.  On the rank and file level, there are people talking about various proposals that might be able to get lawmakers and the president out of this, but until one or both sides moves off their currently entrenched position, there is no end in sight.  And that matters because this isn't just lawmakers.  It isn't just the president.  It is also federal workers -- 800,000 workers will be working without pay or they will be furloughed.  They will start missing their first paychecks on January 11th.  That is real pain.  That is a real bite to people.  And that is often what triggers lawmakers to come to the table and make a deal.   That said, everybody that I'm talking to on Capitol Hill says pretty plainly, don't look at this as a days-long shutdown at this point. You might need to consider it a weeks-long shutdown.  </p><p>Phil Mattingly, CNN, Capitol Hill.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Thank you, Phil.  </p><p>That is the real problem here.  Let's bring in Democratic strategist Keith Boykin who is a former Clinton White House aide, and Ben Ferguson host of \"The Ben Ferguson Show.\"  We've heard stories from federal workers who can't pay for the rent, they can't medical expenses even, one heartbreaking one about a tombstone to bury a loved one.  So Ben, what is the message that the president is sending to nearly 800,000 federal workers?  </p><p>[14:05:06] BEN FERGUSON, HOST, \"THE BEN FERGUSON SHOW\":  Look, I think the message should be, not just from the president, but from Democrats, you need to get in the same room, you need to not leave Washington, and you need to get this done.  And it seems pretty clear that Democrats have left town and the president is still there.  They should be working on this.  The Democratic leadership should not be on vacation right now while they're telling these stories that you just mentioned.  They should be sitting there, they should be meeting at the White House, they should be having discussions.  </p><p>The unfortunate reality is nothing is going to get done until Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House on the 3rd and when they come back to their normal business hours.  They're on vacation.  That matters to them more than being in Washington working for the American people, and I'm glad at least the president is willing to stay in Washington and say let's talk it out, let's have these meetings.  There should be no New Year's parties at any of these people, lawmakers, should be going to.  Unfortunately, they all said my vacation is more important than the American people, the taxpayers, and the government workers.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Keith, what about that?  Because there is something to what is being said here, that you have 800,000 people, who are facing real uncertainty and crises in their lives as a result of this political divide, and the Democrats, yes, they're not in town, they're not there, and they've gone home.  </p><p>KEITH BOYKIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, this is a tragedy, 800,000 people, federal government employees, who are without jobs or who are working without pay.  This is a problem that the Republican Congress created with a Republican president.  Remember, the Democrats do not control the government.  They have not controlled any branch of government for the past two years.  This is the entire problem of the Republican-controlled Congress, and they won't until January 3.  So the idea of blaming Democrats for something that Trump couldn't do himself in two years which he had in office, is preposterous.  Not to mention the fact that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are down in Palm Beach at Mar-a-Lago frolicking around Florida.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  They're not congressman.  They're not senators.  They are not elected officials.  That's a cheap talking point.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  They are White House aides.  They are White House aides.  And the only reason this is a crisis is because Donald Trump refused to tell the truth to the American people that Mexico was not going to pay for this wall.  And he refused to get his own Republican Congress to do something for the past two years, to do this.  So now here we are at the 11th hour, and Trump wants the Democrats to bail him out from the campaign lies that he told.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Let me, let me just insert here, Ben.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  I've got to get in here --  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Hold on, Ben, hold on, Ben, hold on.  The president is not wavering when it comes to funding for his wall, and I want you first to list ton what the Democratic representative from Maryland, that's Steny Hoyer, had to say about this.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND:  He made a promise that was an ill- informed, ill-advised promise, and he said to the Mexican people were going to pay for it.  That was baloney.  He should have known it was baloney.  We don't believe the wall is a good technology.  The American people don't think it's a good technology.  There are other ways to keep our borders secure.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Here's my point, Ben.  The president did make a promise, and Democrats have sort of made a promise that they're not going to give in to him.  There is no give on either side here, and that is really worrisome, especially if you're among the 800,000 without pay.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  Well, again, I look at the president, and if you notice, it is only Democrats that are talking about the -- and it is a talking point, it's trying to hit the president, for him saying Mexico is going to build the wall.  If you talk to Republicans, they have no problem funding it.  That's why there are GoFundMe pages with tens of millions of dollars coming in days before Christmas that are very concerned.  </p><p>The idea that a border wall doesn't work, there's a lot of places, El Paso is a great example where they put up barriers and it had a huge impact on reducing the number of illegal crossings.  You talk to Border Patrol agents, they say it would have a massive impact if they have this wall there.  And the president won on the promise of building the wall.  The American people voted him in as president of the United States of America, this is his core campaign issue.  He has not backed down from it, he hasn't flinched on.  The American people believe that border security is important.</p><p>And I will say it again, if Democrats want to lead on this issue, and they're going to sit out there and tell people they feel sorry for these workers that aren't going to get their paychecks, then you shouldn't be on vacation.  And you're about to be --  SAVIDGE:  OK, we've gone over that, Ben.  Keith, let me ask you this.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  Get your butt back to Washington.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  There is a shift here that the White House is doing, and that is the president very proudly said, look, if there is going to be a government shutdown, I'll own.  But there now seems to be a shift on the part of the White House in which the blame is being placed upon Representative Nancy Pelosi, who soon will be the speaker of the House.  So do you think that strategy works?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  No, it's ridiculous.  Donald Trump campaigned by saying I alone can fix it.  Remember, he said this repeatedly, that he knew Washington better than anyone else.  He was going to fix the problems. He was going to get everybody in a room and sit them down and negotiate.  </p><p>[14:10:02] I'll remind you, he has a Republican Congress that is still in charge for the rest of this year and until January 3rd.  He can't even get his Republican Congress to pass the border wall that he wants to pass.  He hasn't been able to do this for two years.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  They already did in the House.  It is a Senate issue.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  And now he wants the Democrats to bail him out for a campaign promise --</p><p>FERGUSON:  Keith, you can't re-write history.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  -- that he made that was a lie from the very beginning.  It was a lie from the very beginning.</p><p>FERGUSON:  Keith, they already voted thon in the House.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  And he said, who is going to pay for it, and the crowd repeatedly Mexico.  They didn't say the American taxpayers.  They said Mexico.  That was a lie.  And he should pay for it.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Then let me ask you this.  The president is threatening to shut down the southern border.  He is upping the ante in what is already a very problematic battle of political wills.  Is that going to work?  And do you think he really means it?  </p><p>FERGUSON:  I think the president is dead serious about this issue, and it is a national security issue, it's an American worker and protecting American workers and jobs and wages issue.  And I think the president has realized that it is his duty and obligation to go all in on this issue and to figure out and to broker the best deal possible. At the end of the day there's going to have to be -- </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Shut down the border, the financial impact alone, though, that would that be?  </p><p>FERGUSON:  Again, it is a question of, if you look at only the financial impact, any massive change in American history usually is pretty tough to do.  And the president understands that.  And to do anything big in Washington, unfortunately, there's always going to be, well, what about this, or what about that?  You look at this police officer that was killed in California on Christmas Eve.  I think the president looks at the illegal immigrant that killed him and said why is this person in this country illegally?  How is he able to cross the border at will whenever he wants to?  I am going to protect the American people.  This is my promise, and everything is on the table, to get this done.  And I support the president in doing that.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  All right, Keith, what will it take to come up with a compromise, because it is going to have to be one, to get this government open again and people paid?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Unfortunately, it seems the only solution is for Democrats to take control of the House on January 3rd, and then finally Trump will realize he can't get his border wall done and he will go back to a reasonable negotiating position.  I don't see anything changing before that.  </p><p>But the story just came out today in the \"New York Daily News\" that Trump's own golf course in New Jersey has been apparently handing out fraudulent green cards and Social Security numbers to people at his golf club.  So he is the most hypocritical person in the country when he talks about the impact of illegal immigration on the economy in this country.  Donald Trump has been inconsistent on this issue from the beginning.  He lied about Mexico.  He is lying about the border wall.  And he is the only one that is keeping the government shutdown. </p><p>FERGUSON:  How is he lying about the border wall?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  He is the one who is keeping the government shutdown.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  How is he lying about the border wall?  He has been consistent about that.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Then what's the solution?  What's the solution from your point of view?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  He lied when he said he wouldn't blame the Democrats, and now he's blaming Nancy Pelosi for what he himself has done.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  Nancy Pelosi is not in town.  If you've got to have a deal done, you have to have a deal done with the Democrats.</p><p>BOYKIN:  She is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  Keith, you know that.  You worked in the White House, for goodness sake.</p><p>BOYKIN:  She is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  She is about to be.  She takes the job.  You know this. This is the part that is absurd.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of the House.  </p><p>FERGUSON:  She is about to be the speaker of the House.  She just started ahead of time.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Thanks very much for joining us, Ben Ferguson, thank you very much, we appreciate both of you for joining in on the conversation.  And we hope that a solution is found soon.  We'll have you back in the new year.  Thanks.  </p><p>And in the midst of this government shutdown, it is very easy to forget about the tens of thousands of families affected.  It is not just politics.  I spoke to one government worker earlier today about how the shutdown is impacting her.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  If you could, you have the opportunity, right now, to speak directly to lawmakers, what would you say to them?  </p><p>LILA JOHNSON, FEDERAL CONTRACT EMPLOYEE:  I will say they should come to some kind of a decision, because people like me, is struggling, working, it is hard on us.  And for President Trump to be throwing a temper about a wall, the American people, I didn't ask for it.  That's something that he promised the people when he was elected.  Why should we have to pay for it?  And this should come to some kind of agreement to open the government back up so people like me, my coworkers, and everybody else can go back to work.  We are working people.  We don't need to be standing on the line for them up on the Hill, in the White House, wherever, fighting over when is they going to open the government back up?  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Can I ask you, how much longer can you get by with this shutdown?  Or is it already to the point where it's almost desperate?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  It is to the point now.  It's not about how much longer. It's to the point now that I need to be working to pay my bills and take care of my family.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[14:15:06] SAVIDGE:  Still ahead, the Trump administration still laser-focused on the border.  Now, we're learning new details of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's latest trip.  We'll take you live to El Paso.  </p><p>Plus, later, a hotel guest kicked out while talking on the phone in the lobby.  Now the hotel is responding after a nationwide backlash. We'll tell you what their decision is after this.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  We're following new developments in the California case, where more arrests have been made after a police officer Ronil Singh was gunned down the day after Christmas during a traffic stop. Authorities now have arrested the girlfriend and the brother of the suspect, that is Gustavo Perez Arriaga.  Police arrested Arriaga Friday, and they say that he was in the U.S. legally and he might have been trying to escape to Mexico.  CNN national correspondent Sara Sidner has more on that arrest.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Less than 48 hours after losing his brother, his hero, his friend, Reggie Singh stepped to the mics.  He had just learned his brother's suspected killer had been caught.  </p><p>REGGIE SINGH, VICTIM'S BROTHER:  He is not coming back, but there's a lot of people out there that misses him, and a lot of law enforcement people that I don't know that work days and nights to make this happen.  </p><p>SIDNER:  Ronil Singh came to this country as an immigrant from Fiji. He was living his version of the American dream.  He wanted to become a police officer, and he did just that.  He dreamt of a family.  Five months ago, he and his wife welcomed their son into the world.  But at 1:00 in the morning, the day after Christmas, Singh's dream abruptly ended.  </p><p>[14:20:00] CHIEF RANDY RICHARD, NEWMAN POLICE:  I did not know Christmas morning at 4:00 in the morning when I said goodbye to him and sent him off to his family that it would be the last time that I saw him.  </p><p>SIDNER:  Police say Singh was killed by Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who, unlike Singh, had come into the country illegally.  Deputies caught up with Arriaga at a home near Bakersfield, California, after a massive manhunt.  </p><p>SHERIFF ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY:  This criminal, Mr. Arriaga, crossed our border illegally into Arizona some time ago.  He is a criminal.  He has two prior arrests for DUI.  </p><p>SIDNER:  Several people were arrested, including Arriaga's brother and a co-worker, who were accused of lying to authorities and impeding their ability to find him faster.  While Singh's family wept around him, the Stanislaus County sheriff could not contain his outrage over California's so-called sanctuary law.  </p><p>CHRISTIANSON:  And under SB-54 in California, based on two arrests for DUI and some other active warrants that this criminal has out there, law enforcement would have been prevented, prohibited from sharing any information with ICE about this criminal gang member.  </p><p>SIDNER:  Some law enforcement officials completely disagreed, saying the law actually encourages people to come forward who would otherwise avoid helping law enforcement because of citizenship status.  But the sheriff's sentiment has been embraced by others, including the man with the largest megaphone.  President Trump tweeted about the case, using it in his pitched battle to build a border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  </p><p>No matter who wins the political battle, there is little that can ease the pain of the Singh family.  Their one small solace, Singh's canine partner Sam will simply become the family pet.  The police department is retiring the dog because, as the chief put it, the Singh family shouldn't have to lose another family member.   Sara Sidner, CNN, Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  On another story, two hotel employees in Portland, Oregon, have been fired after they were caught on video calling the police on a black guest who was talking on his phone.  Jermaine Massey says that he was racially profiled while in the lobby of the Portland DoubleTree hotel.  He says he was a guest at the hotel and he was approached by hotel employees who doubted his explanation that he was a guest.  The security guard eventually called the police on him.  Massey shot video of the incident on his cell phone, and, yes, the encounter soon went viral.  </p><p>For more on, let's bring in CNN's Miguel Marquez.  And Miguel, what more can you tell us about the development?  </p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This seems to be another example of a situation where you have white individuals who, for whatever reason, call the police on black individuals doing fairly minor things, if anything concerning at all, essentially breathing while black.  </p><p>Mr. Massey checked in on December 22nd into that DoubleTree hotel, it's part of the Hilton chain.  The two employees that you see in the video have been fired.  He had come back from a concert that night, he had a text from his mother to call, he stopped in the lobby, there was a lot of people in there so he went off to a quieter part of the lobby.  That's when he had the encounter with this security guard.  He put it all on social media, as one does these days, and we took some of the highlights of it to show you sort of how that conversation went.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERMAINE MASSEY, SAYS HOTEL STAFF HARASSED HIM, HAD HIM KICKED OUT: He's calling the cops on me because I'm taking a phone call at the DoubleTree Hotel.  Say hi, Earl.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Portland police will be here in a minute.  </p><p>MASSEY:  Thank you.  Call them.  I'm waiting.  They're coming why? Why are they coming?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To escort you off the property.  </p><p>MASSEY:  Because what, and I'm staying here?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not anymore.  </p><p>MASSEY:  How am I loitering in an area that's public?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're sitting here.</p><p>MASSEY:  So this area is off limits after a certain time?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Only if you're a guest.  </p><p>MASSEY:  I am a guest.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You didn't tell me that.  </p><p>MASSEY:  I said that I'm a guest.  I told you that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUEZ:  Now, the Portland mayor in a tweet referred to this as part of the systemic nature of discrimination.  Portland police eventually did show up, escorted Mr. Massey to his room, and then out of the hotel.  The hotel has apologized.  They have investigated and now fired those two employees.</p><p>But Mr. Massy and his lawyer, they want more.  They want something in writing from DoubleTree hotel, or the Hilton chain, explaining why was he approached, what are the rules in these circumstances, and let individuals know if they are going to make a private phone call in a public lobby, and they are staying there, what is it that would engender that sort of attention from a security guard, and then to have it escalate to the point where they're kicked out of their room by that time about midnight on the 23rd.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  And unbelievable story.  And thank goodness he rolled on all of it.  Miguel Marquez, thank you very much for that.  </p><p>MARQUEZ:  You got it.  </p><p>[14:25:00] SAVIDGE:  And we'll be right back.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Major developments in North Carolina that could impact the future of a congressional seat there.  The North Carolina state board of elections dissolved Friday without certifying results from the ninth congressional district, which shows Republican Mark Harris ahead by just 905 votes over Democrat Dan MccReady.  The prospects for a new election are now pretty much in doubt for a race that was tainted by allegations of ballot fraud by a Republican operative.  </p><p>Adding to the uncertainty, the incoming House majority leader says House Democrats will not allow the Republican candidate to be sworn in next week because of the ongoing investigation.  </p><p>For more on all of this, let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes.  And Kristen, what is going to happen next?  </p><p>KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Martin, that is the big question.  And it's just as complicated as it is messy.  So the board of elections dissolved.  This was at the order of a panel of state judges who deemed it unconstitutional.  And this is from an ongoing legal battle from 2016.  But it has huge implications for what is going on right now within the state.  </p><p>Not only was the board of elections running the investigation into whether or not there was potential ballot fraud.  They were also holding a hearing January 11th to go over the evidence from that investigation, and essentially decide whether or not there was going to be a new election.  </p><p>Now, in addition to that, as you mentioned, they never certified a winner in this election.  Harris did try to make a last-ditch effort on Friday, right before the board dissolved, trying to get certified as the winner.  They rebuffed him.  Now, he plans to take this to federal court to force them to certify him as the winner.  So we'll have to see what happens with that.  </p><p>But what this all means moving forward, well, first, take a look at Congress.  We know that Congress is set to start, all of those new members are going to be sworn in on January 3rd.  </p><p>[14:30:04] And Harris doesn't really have a legal leg to stand on despite the fact that he was in the lead.  Without a court order, and without certification, there is no legal authority that says that he should get the seat.  But in addition to that, if he were to show up, let's say, and try to claim the seat, Democrats say they are going to fight against this tooth and nail.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) MARYLAND:  His election has not been certified. In light of that, and in light of the fact that so many Republicans in North Carolina admit and observe that there was fraud, obviously, conducted in the general election in North Carolina, in that district, that he should not be seated unless the cloud is lifted.  My own view is, we probably ought to redo the general election.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES:  So how that's going to happen we just don't know, because right now there is no board of elections.  But moving forward with the investigation, that is a whole other mess here.  So Democratic Governor Roy Cooper under a new state law is required to appoint a new board of elections.  Now, this is supposed to be done on January 31st. So he has said that he will appoint an interim board of elections to continue with this investigation.  Republicans now say not so fast. They claim Cooper does not have the authority to do that.  And now they're saying they will take this to court if they have to.  So this could be tied up for quite some time, Martin.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  As you said, Kristen, messy and complicated.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  </p><p>A new threat from the Kremlin.  Russia claims its new supersonic missile is in vulnerable and it's all set to go.  What does this mean for our national security?  We'll have more on that right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Russia says that it has a new hypersonic missile system and that it will enter service next year.   [14:35:01] Russian president Vladimir Putin claims it's invulnerable to U.S. defenses after a test of the missile Wednesday.  Putin says it is a wonderful gift to the country for the new year.  CNN's Barbara Starr has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  U.S. defense officials say this is the real deal.  Russia test-firing its new high speed, hypersonic missile, a missile that the U.S. military currently cannot defend against.  Russian President Vladimir Putin pulling no punches on his intent.  </p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, (through translator):  The new avant-garde missile system is invincible against today's and future air and missile defense systems of the potential enemy.  This is a big success and a great achievement.  </p><p>COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  If the weapons work as advertised, there is no current defense against them.  </p><p>STARR:  The Russian missile has captured the attention of Patrick Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary who will take over as acting Pentagon chief when Secretary James Mattis leaves next week.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have a number of options going on with hypersonic missiles.  </p><p>STARR:  Shanahan warns the U.S. needs to be able to detect the fast- flying missile, much further away than current radar systems can handle.  The U.S. has to detect it thousands, not hundreds of miles away, because of its high-speed approach.  The Pentagon may spend more than $1 billion trying to develop and field its own capabilities.  </p><p>The Russians are making significant, yet unproven claims, about their missiles, saying it's capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, it flies up to 20 times faster than the speed of sound, it can adjust altitude and direction to avoid detection.  Putin says it's invincible.  </p><p>GEN. JOHN HYTEN, COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. STRATEGIC COMMAND:  We are going to need a different set of sensors in order to see the hypersonic threats.  Our adversaries know that.  </p><p>STARR:  The challenges are also political for President Trump whose relationship with Russian president Putin has been rocky since July's Helsinki summit.  </p><p>LEIGHTON:  Putin feels incredibly emboldened.  Putin believes this is the time to press his advantage.  He's put his forces in Ukraine, in eastern Ukraine.  He's of course taking over Crimea.  He's now gaining ground in Syria.  This is Russia's time, in his view.  </p><p>STARR:  U.S. defense officials are taking no chances on whether the Russian system works, or it does not.  They say they are proceeding with a U.S. program to try and match and overmatch whatever the Russians may be up to.

It's supposed to operate independently from political influence.  So President Trump's attacks may have unintended consequences.  If the Fed suddenly slows the pace of rate hikes, that could raise concern, bowing to political pressure.  Or the president could do exactly the opposite of what he intended.  The Fed may feel it has to raise rates to show its not surrendering.  </p><p>[14:45:08] ROMANS:  Number five, Elon Musk's erratic behavior cost Tesla and himself.

I am a beauty and inspirational vlogger on YouTube.  </p><p>I do transformation videos.  That is what people really know for me. The thing that really separate me from everyone else that does YouTube videos is my scars.  </p><p>I am from Nigeria, and I got burned when I was nine-years-old at my mother's restaurant.  The pan of oil just literally fell on me and my youngest sister.  I'm not sure exactly how many surgeries I got.  Life took a huge, huge turn for me.  I didn't want to go to school, and everybody would sort of look at me and felt disgusted.  I started thinking about committing suicide, because of the bullying.  </p><p>When I moved here, I got introduced to proper makeup in the hospital. But then I came across YouTube videos.  </p><p>I started applying that to how I wanted my makeup to look.

I'm very, very much in tune with my looks.  I see beauty regardless.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:55:05] SAVIDGE:  Today, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is in Yuma, Arizona, for a firsthand look at the Customs and Border Protection facilities there.  This comes one day after Nielsen made pretty much the same kind of visit in El Paso yesterday.  The secretary issuing this statement just minutes ago, and it reads in part, \"The system is clearly overwhelmed, and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable populations. We know that if Congress were to act, or the courts were to enforce the law as written, we could address this crisis tomorrow.  Instead, we continue to do more with less.  As I have said before, I asked Congress to please put politics aside and recognize this for the growing security and humanitarian crisis it is,\" unquote.  </p><p>Earlier, I speak to the mayor of El Paso about those facilities, what a border shutdown would do to the community, and what caused the unnoticed drop-off of hundreds of migrants in El Paso.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>MAYOR DEE MARGO, (R) EL PASO, TEXAS:  I agree with the statement she released related to the broken immigration policy.  That's the problem.  El Paso is dealing with the symptoms as a result of the lack of fortitude in Washington to deal with, on both sides of the aisle, to deal with our immigration policy.  </p><p>We are being inundated.  We've got five times the release of migrants here since October than we had a year ago.  We're averaging about 2,000 a week.  And I got word yesterday that -- actually this morning, that they may have to increase the releases up to 500 a day, and I'm not sure we can handle that.  And Annunciation House, our primary NGO, they are the ones that coordinate this with 20 other shelters, but I'm not sure we can handle it.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  And Mayor, let me ask you this.  How do your community, your city's resources, come into play, with what is a federal issue?  Is it not?  </p><p>MARGO:  It is.  And that's part of the problem.  You can't apply for disaster relief when the federal government is causing the problem to begin with.  We're looking at whatever we can do.  </p><p>But right now, the NGO, the Annunciation House, takes in donations and handles it, and they're doing a magnificent job of doing that.  The city provides security.  Our bus system, our metro provides transportation for the migrants to the shelters, and we will use our -- and our office of emergency management is coordinating everything. But we will also use our ambulances, et cetera, if it's required for these medical checks that have been increased as a result of he tragic death of the two young Guatemalans.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  From your vantage point --   MARGO:  We've been doing whatever we've been asked to do.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  From your vantage point, and as a community leader, what did you stress to the secretary that needed to be done immediately.  </p><p>MARGO:  We clarified the problem you announced on Christmas Day that occurred a week ago Sunday, with was the lack of analysis, the lack of information.  We're told that our agreement, the Annunciation House's agreement with ICE and CBP is that they will give us at least a 24- hour notice on the releases, and how many.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Why didn't that happen?  Do you know?  Did she explain?  </p><p>MARGO:  I think it was just an unfortunate glitch.  This is one time it happened.  We talked about that.  It didn't look willful or intentional.  It was just an unfortunate glitch in communication.  But I get a text message usually every day announcing the number that are going to be released.  And the Annunciation House talks about where they are going to be sheltered.  </p><p>But we've got this issue.  It is continuing.  We're the second largest port.  We're receiving these, as I say, daily.  As I've said on previous interviews with CNN and other networks, is you want to know about immigration, and you want to know about the border, come to El Paso.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  And I agree with you.  I've been down there and that that is the place that you see it firsthand.  </p><p>MARGO:  -- the U.S.-Mexican border.</p><p>SAVIDGE:  Let me ask you before we run out of time and I'm sorry to interrupt, but the president has threatened a shutdown of the southern border.  How would that impact your community?  </p><p>MARGO:  It would be a killer.  We have, in addition to the migrant community that we're dealing with, and that issue, it's commerce. We've got 23,000 pedestrians, legal pedestrians, that cross every day north from Mexico.  We have commerce trucks back and forth.  We have 21 million private passenger vehicles on an annual basis that come north legally.  So from a commerce stand point, we're the 10th largest port in the nation.  We got $82 billion going back and forth in imports and exports.  It would be a killer.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE:  And we will see if the president makes good on that threat. Thank you for joining me.  I'm Martin Savidge.

I', Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Monday, January 21st, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shutdown showdown day 31.  President Trump making an offer to end the government shutdown, but the Democrats showed no signs of compromise yet.  We look at what's on the table straight ahead.  Economic slowdown in China.  New numbers out show that growth in China came in at its slowest pace last year since 1990.  What this means for our markets, the global economy and President Trump's trade negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Super Bowl LIII set.  The Patriots, yes, heading back to the big game for third straight year, but it was a controversial call.  In the Saints-Rams game that has everyone talking this morning, unfair say those Saints fans.  The highlights later this hour.  Plus catch of the day, a bald eagle goes viral after it was caught on camera stealing a fisherman's fresh catch.  We will show you that to you over and over and over again right now.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.</p><p>U.S. markets might be closed for the holiday today and we celebrate today the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but we are open for business here at the FOX Business Network.  Let's take a look at how the futures are faring this morning.  We have a 99-point loss on the features.  The global market action will really tell you what's afoot here.  In Europe, we have some mixed markets.  Losses in France and Germany, and in Asia overnight, we take a look at gains across the board there.  Despite this news out of China that the economy last year grew at the slowest pace since 1990, more on that straight ahead.</p><p>Be sure to join us tomorrow.  By the way, we kickoff live coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Maria Bartiromo will be back one-on-one with Verizon's CEO, Blackstone's CEO Stephen Schwarzman, IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty, Microsoft's President Brad Smith, SAP's CEO Bill McDermott, a favorite of this program, and Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan.  That bank out with some great numbers last week.  You don't want to miss any of Maria's coverage from Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>Meantime, the government shutdown enters day 31.  Democrats rejecting President Trump's bid to reopen the government that offered DACA protections in exchange to fund the border wall.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle weighing in yesterday with Maria Bartiromo on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Tell me you're thinking in terms of what your colleagues will push back on.</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN (R-ND), SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE:  Well, that's it.  This is just basic common sense.  First, it's just part of national security.  Second, they voted for it before we have existing border wall, border fence, whatever you want to call it, the fund -- Democrats have funded it for previous Presidents, including President Obama, there -- there's no reason to turn this down, particularly now when we're reaching out and compromising on things that they want.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  I don't know any Democrat that doesn't care about keeping nation safe.  We do need --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>DINGELL:  -- to have border security.  And we need to talk about --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let me -- let me stop you there --</p><p>DINGELL:  It's not just the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you say that you don't know any Democrats who don't want border security and yet none of them voted for Kate's law, none of them voted to end sanctuary city status.  None of them voted for the DACA plan that the President put on the table.  So, can you really say that, that they're for border security when they haven't voted for any of the above?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know, yes, I can say that.  And I'm going to talk about how we need to support actual policy that works.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This as Senate Majority Mitch McConnell reportedly prepares to call a vote on the President's offer to protect Dreamers combining it with legislation pass by House Democrats to fund government agencies through the fiscal year.  Here with me now, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and FOX News contributor, Richard Fowler.  Welcome, gentlemen.  You'll be with me all three hours, so buckle up.</p><p>Deirdre's coming up in a minute, but speaking of buckling up, you are all about business.  Is there pressure on the Republicans on President Trump to do something because of the impact on the economy, more and more that we're seeing?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  I think, Dagen, every single day is going to get more and more pressure.  It went from being an inconvenience where school lunches are impacted and it becomes annoying to something where it's going to be an impact on the economy.  It's 800,000 people, their families, they're spending their decisions slowly but surely, it's gone start to slow down (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is payments to contractors, the employees who work for contractors, it is SBA loans, small business loans to getting approved and --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The food and beverage industry is impact.  It's -- the knock on effect goes on and on and on and I think it's going to start to drag on fourth quarter GDP on, no question about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  (INAUDIBLE) GDP.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard, is there room for compromise in terms of the -- because the Democrat's response from Nancy Pelosi was we're -- no.  To the -- and we should point out this is protection for Dreamers, DACA resident for three years.  So, it's temporary protection for them, and other individuals, about 300,000 individuals who were facing deportation.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think there's actually is room for a deal.  I think what Democrats -- I mean I think the big lynchpin for Democrats is let's reopen the government first and let's not use the 800,000 workers as a bargaining chip and then actually let's sit down and come to the table and figure out how we do reel last the immigration reform, not short-term fixes, not a one-term wall allocation, but how do we look at this system and work -- and make sure it works perfectly for right now?</p><p>And I think that's where Democrats are, but what we're saying -- that the Democrats are saying very clearly the President is, let's not keep the government shutdown while we negotiate immigration.  There are two different things, reopen negotiate, take those 800,000 people back to work meanwhile that's happening we will -- we can negotiation and we can debate.  And we can have a debate about ideals of how we fix our broken immigration system.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reason -- one of the reasons and you saw it on the display, one of the more -- the recent White House meeting.  President Trump being dug in on this in terms of the order rather than we reopen the government and we can debate and then we talk of -- then we talk about funding the wall, is what you're talking about, is because President Trump looked at Nancy Pelosi and said a month from now, if we reopen the government, will you fund my wall?  And she said no.</p><p>FOWLER:  Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so that's where we are.</p><p>FOWLER:  No, I get that.  I think that one of the reasons for that and I think the reason why Speaker Pelosi, as well as Leader Schumer, and some Republicans are some House Republicans who've defected from the President.  I think the reason being is that there's larger problems in our Southern Border.  If you look at the illegal immigration problem in this country, every (INAUDIBLE) will you our Southern Border isn't the problem, our problem is Visa overstays.</p><p>When we people come to our airports, they come to our seaports, they -- they're on tourist visa, there's -- they're on student visa, and they chose to -- they choose to stay in the United States.  You could build a 80-foot wall, Dagen, and you're still going to have visa overstays.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I think that the flip side of this -- and this in part when Bret Baier interviewed Steny Hoyer last week, he asked the Majority Leader in the House, he said, \"OK, well then do you want to get rid of the wall that exists now?  If you don't believe in funding additional wall, do you want to take down what's there now?\"  And he went, \"No.\"  But -- I paraphrased, but again that's where we are.  Why not let's do all of it?  And we can't even get something -- again, $5.7 billion is not a small amount of money, but in the size of our multitrillion-dollar economy, it is a small amount of money.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It seems to be so obvious that there are compromises here, but both sides are just so dug in that it looks like the impasse goes on indefinitely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, flyers are going to get more and more angry because I know that the TSA, the unscheduled absence rate, hit eight percent Saturday, up from seven percent on Friday, and it was up from three percent a year earlier.  So, there are the -- once it rally -- it -- average everyday Americans start to feel this, look out in Washington.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You want to hear outrage?  Wait until I'm impacted by this.  Then we can hear clear outrage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Calm, Cool, and Collected, both of you quite frankly.</p><p>FOWLER:  No, and I mean I think beyond that, I think the other thing you have to worry about is this is the last payment.  I think this week's is last payment for food stamps (INAUDIBLE) program, so starting next week, folks are going to start going hungry and that's the facts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't you hate all politicians?  I --</p><p>FOWLER:  Happy Martin Luther King Day, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  We are going to talk about some uplift -- we're going to talk about the good things going on in this country.  I promise.</p><p>China's economic growth is the slowest that it's been since 1990 according to the Wall Street Journal.  Deirdre Bolton, what is your take on this?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Dagen, there's a few takes, right?  There's two main reasons.  So you have the trade war with the U.S. that is certainly hurting China, and then you have China's own President, Xi Jinping, about three years ago really trying to curb borrowings.  This is fact that -- there he is there.  Basically just putting a cap on what businesses can borrow, on what government has borrowed, and so essentially slow down the growth rate all by himself.</p><p>Now UBS saying watch for China to increase stimulus measure as we go forward.  You're looking at that graph right now.  So, we're giving you this perspective back from 2009 to present day.  And as you said, Dagen, I mean slowest rate in nearly three decades.  The other thing I wanted to point out, Chinese jobless rates, 4.9 percent last month.  And while that is mostly expected as far as what strategies we're think, it is certainly representative of the slowdown.</p><p>So, one thing ahead to come, just watch for stimulus.  UBS out with a big report, big note on that this morning saying China is going to do everything it can to gin up again especially as the trade war with the U.S. continues, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the big question is -- and I know Mitch can talk about this as the discussion moves on, Deirdre, is that can we even believe these numbers?  And what is going to be China's reaction to this?  Because in the past, it was they're trying to lower the debt levels in the nation.  And so it will be interesting to see how they try and prop up their economy there.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I mean I think we're always concerned, right, about the sort of how we can those statistics and whether or not they're a hundred percent on, but the slowing theme seems to be confirmed by many sources, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the Chinese markets were higher overnight despite the news, so, again, maybe their reaction is, \"Tell us something we don't know.\"  Thank you, Deirdre.  We'll see you shortly.</p><p>Meantime, moving on to this story, an Alabama police officer shot and killed.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Dagen.  Officer Sean Tuder was fatally shot yesterday afternoon in Mobile, Alabama.  He is the second officer in Alabama to lose his life in the line of duty just this month.  Police say a 19-year-old suspect was arrested.  Officer Tuder joined the Mobile Police Department back in 2016.  He was named Officer of the Month in August of 2017.  His death brings the total number of officers shot and killed in the U.S. now to four so far this year.</p><p>Well, another headline this morning, we're watching Former Nissan Motors Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has made another request for bail as his detention stretches into its ninth week.  The Tokyo District Court is going to hear Ghosn's later request, in which he's offering to pay for an ankle monitor and security guards, as well as surrender his passport.  Ghosn still maintains that he is innocent as he's accused of underreporting his compensation at Nissan.  The court rejected Ghosn's initial bail request last week,</p><p>Well, here we go again, later today, British Prime Minister Theresa May going to present her plan B for the U.K. to exit the European Union as it's going to look like plan A is the question.  Just last week, Parliament (INAUDIBLE) rejected her initial deal and reports say that May has been holding talks with the opposition parties because of a split in her own conservative party.  Remember, 118 in her own party voted against her last week.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles appears to be keeping the Irish and the Northern Ireland border open if the U.K. and E.U fail to strike to a deal.  So Ireland's at play here.  The deadline to leave the E.U, March 29th, Dagen.  Just kind of uphill battle right now that she is fighting and Brussels is kind of not interested in talking it seems.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl, for that --</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- story -- all those stories.  Coming up, heartbreak for the New Orleans Saints, the Rams beating them for a spot in the Super Bowl, but one controversial no call getting all the attention this morning.  Plus caught on camera, watch as this brazen bald eagle snatches a fisherman's bounty right from under his nose.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  New fallout for Facebook.  The Washington Post reporting the social media giant could face a record-setting fine over its data privacy scandal.  The Federal Trade Commission's highest penalty on record has against Google for 22 and a half million dollars.  What's your reaction to this?  When I see an M instead of a B, I'm like, \"Heh.\"</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Yes.  The legal fees that they'll spend could ellipse that.  I think the -- there's a cultural shift going on with this company because younger folks don't use it.  They certainly use Instagram --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is owned by Facebook.</p><p>FOWLER:  Which is owned by Facebook.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Which is owned by Facebook, right?  I'm just -- but that's a separate story, but Facebook really is for sort of the baby boomers and I don't think that there's a complete understanding what really goes on there.  So, I think as more and more user -- but you're starting to see people aren't checking as much, 26 percent deleted the app.  So, there's something going on there.  And I -- and I that it's going to impact that company if they don't get ahead of this the right way.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I mean Sheryl Sandberg, right, the COO, making this kind of speech in Munich, which was very much (INAUDIBLE) I mean if you heard it, it sort of seems like OK this is what I need to say to keep the regulators in Europe at bay and now breathing down our neck as they are.  But to your point, I actually think there is an increased likelihood that the U.S. is going to go the way of that GDPR and really start to enforce some rules against big tech.  I'm with you, though, as far ask, like, the millions that doesn't really even --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  That's like Facebook's coffee budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It -- what were you going to say?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But I don't -- but I don't know who regulates it.  I mean what I can imagine is Congress decides to do something and we can't even figure out for years what agency is going to be responsible for it.  Is it the telecom industry?  Is it the Federal Trade Commission?  I don't know who's responsible for regulating.</p><p>FOWLER:  I think -- Mitch, I think you bring up a good point.  I think beyond that, I think even scarier is the idea that congress is going to try to regulate Facebook when you saw at the Zuckerberg hearing not too long ago they were asking questions about, like, \"So when you run banner ads on WhatsApp,\" and I'm like there's no banner ads on WhatsApp.  It's encrypted.  But I digress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Almost as good as the Google questions about the iPhone and the guy was like --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Exactly.  We don't --</p><p>BOLTON:  We're -- that's actually not my company.  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  We don't take another company.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  But I think you're also right.  I mean the point where, as the millennial on the panel, the point where my mom got on Facebook is the point where I started to sort of migrate off the platform.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  And I think for a lot of people --</p><p>BOLTON:  So what do you use?  Snap?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Or your grand -- or you grandmother's on it.</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  What do you use, Snap?</p><p>FOWLER:  Instagram.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>FOWLER:  Instagram, Twit -- more so Instagram than anything.</p><p>BOLTON:  But they're still getting your data then.</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  So yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  Facebook.</p><p>FOWLER:  So Facebook is still getting my data regardless.  It's going through one of their other --</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  -- companies.  But I do think that -- when it comes to -- we've got to figure this out.  We've got to figure out pretty quickly on how we regulate these tech companies.  One, who's going to write the regs, and two, where are the regs going to go?  Which agency will be responsible for these regulations, because it's clear that regulations are going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I've said this literally for years --</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- on (INAUDIBLE) that if they don't do something to rein in their nefarious behavior, I'll use that term, then they're asking for the asking for the government to come in.  This is well before the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>BOLTON:  And the potential top cop has made --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- recent comments, right?  We spoke about that last week, about saying -- Barr saying, \"OK, yes, I am going to look into privacy, data security, and how these companies function.\"</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The big -- the biggest way that -- there a few -- a couple of things that Washington can do.  And this was -- this was when they rolled out Facebook Live, the video -- the live video streaming service.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people were killing other people on it and committing murders and suicides and their reaction was we --</p><p>BOLTON:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oops -- no, oops, it was oops we didn't think about that before we rolled out the -- rolled out that platform.  But there are two things that I think Washington can do.  One, there are liability projections for these social media companies for user-generated content because they're not treated like media companies.  Washington can revisit that.  And then also any other acquisitions these companies make.  They can put the --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I (INAUDIBLE) and I also think that if you notice there's two different strategies from the tech company -- so Google, when they went down the Capitol Hill, they sort of said, \"Yes, regulations are good and we'll work with you on them, which is very much a different strategy in the strategy.  \"I can't find the light switch.\"</p><p>BOLTON:  I think people -- actually lobbying-wise, they spend the most time --</p><p>FOWLER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- and the most money in D.C.  They have been there for years.  I mean even when Eric Schmidt, it was pretty much base down there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they had to scramble after President Trump was elected to try and hire somebody who actually could speak Republican, I guess.</p><p>BOLTON:  They had -- that they kind of -- but their infrastructure is there --</p><p>FOWLER:  They have a huge --</p><p>BOLTON:  -- I feel like more than any other big tech.</p><p>FOWLER:  They have a big infrastructure and they have a different strategy.  I mean the strategy -- when Sandeep went down there, he was talking about, yes, we're open to regulation.  Here's what we think regulation could look like.  Whereas on Facebook did none of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but Google's -- we should say Google's CEO showed up a lot later, but I basically --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And then -- and after Monday, had like the blank chair --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, the -- but the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is the Google -- right.  So he was reticent to show up in front of those lawmakers, real quick note.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yesterday's proven that when your industry's going to get regulated, get ahead of it --</p><p>FOWLER:  yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- and help the regulators figure out.  Don't fight with them.</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes.  And I think that's the -- that's the prevailing that Google has over Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Or a lot of the other companies, too.  They've got --</p><p>BOLTON:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- they've got problems.  Like look at Twitter.  What happened to -- on Twitter over the weekend, we'll talk about that later in the show.</p><p>BOLTO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, major hurdles for millennials in the housing market, what the generation is facing is it tries to enter the home buying game, and shaking up the beard game, the change Bud Light is making to its cold brew and it's big impact on the craft beer industry.  That's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're taking a look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Denver Post writing about how millennials are facing major hurdles to becoming homebuyers.  The article points that millennials are expected to make out.  Forty-five percent of the people taking out mortgages this year.  But according to the article, some of the challenges that that group of young people is facing, high student loan debt and slow wage growth, something that the Federal Reserve published a paper on.</p><p>Meanwhile the Boston Globe has an article on how the V.C. forecast includes hopes for A.I. in Africa and worries about politicians.  A dozen local venture capitalist speaking out on key developments that they're watching among them.  Artificial intelligence and biotechnology to virtual goods like online avatars.</p><p>Finally, we look at the Seattle Times that asked, \"Forget to take your medication?  A new digital pill will alert you, and your doctor.\"  A physician is prescribing pills with a mini-sensor inside.  The sensor travels the body, sending data to a mobile app including your heart rate, and whether the pill was even taken.  The pill has raised privacy concerns with critics wondering if the sensors can be hacked.  Richard Fowler, you're a millennial.  But --</p><p>FOWLER:  Oh, Lord.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think this might even be enough in terms of technology use.</p><p>FOWLER:  That might be like the mark of the beast or something.  That's a scary --</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, dystopian (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FOWLER:  That's a scary idea that there's a pill that my doctor's tracking what I'm do -- no.  I'm get -- no.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Were you -- were -- I want to -- but you were saying that Facebook's facial recognition technology is super freaky.</p><p>FOWLER:  Yes, that already -- yes.  So the Facebook facial recognition already creeps me out.  The idea of popping a pill and then the doctor can, like, track my heart rate, no, that's a little bit -- little bit too much privacy that I'm giving up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>FOWLER:  But I do want to buy a home one day, so hey.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  If we merge those two stories, what about medical data privacy?  So all of this is out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And medical -- that people's medical data being hacked is a huge issue.  And all of a sudden, we've got social media involved with what -- information about what pills we take, that scares me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can say that the --</p><p>FOWLER:  I am also.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- protections for medical data in this country, if you've ever (INAUDIBLE) into a hospital's website or your doctor's network website, it is not what it should be in terms of the two-factor authentication.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the things that are in place that other social media companies have.  And by the way, I just want to add, almost every piece of information that Facebook has about me is completely made up.  I did that from the get-go because I -- because I'm --</p><p>BOLTON:  It's a good experiment --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- like, you know what, if you're going to make money off of me, you can make money off my best self.</p><p>FOWLER:  Listen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is just completely fabricated.</p><p>FOWLER:  I was on Facebook when you had to have a college email address to be on it.  Now, everyone's on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well, fewer today than even three months ago.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I mean beyond that -- but they stopped checking their birthday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLER:  (INAUDIBLE) remembered it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why -- so that's why everybody forgot my birthday.  I'm just kidding.</p><p>FOWLER:  I didn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mine's fake, so I was not born in 1987, which we all know is not true.</p><p>FOWLER:  Hey, that's the year I was born.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It could be true, Dagen.  It could be true.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  God bless you.  God bless you.  God bless you.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It could be true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, day 31 of the government shutdown causing a ripple through all agencies.  We'll tell you about the important economic data that's getting postponed because of it.</p><p>And snatch and grab, watch as this bald eagle sneakily grabs a fisherman's catch of the day.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.

Take a look at the Futures there, pointing to a lower open this morning, 122-point loss on the Dow Futures, as a government enters day 31 of the shutdown.</p><p>Joining me now, Crossmark Global Investments Chief Market Strategist, Victoria Fernandez, Victoria, what do investors need to see, because even in the midst of the shutdown, we have had a rally in the markets to start the New Year, four weeks in a row.  What are investors watching?</p><p>VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTMENTS:  I think we're really watching earnings at this point in time.  You know, at the end of last year, sentiment was really driving the volatility that we saw in the markets.  People were very concerned about what the Fed was going to do.  Most of the movement was headline-driven.</p><p>And I think now, we've shifted last week, as the banks really kicked off earnings.  We've shifted and really focused on some more of the fundamentals and that's why we've seen the markets improved a little bit.  But, now that we have more headline news coming out of Washington, when the markets reopen tomorrow, I think we may have some more headline-driven movement, that's why we're seeing Futures, down, a little bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch, in terms of the earnings bank stocks last week, posted their strongest five-day gains in more than two years.  The KBW NASDAQ Bank Index was up almost eight percent, 7.7 percent, so there was good news, even -- some of the reports were mixed, some earnings per share misses, like on J.P. Morgan.  But Mitch, talk about that.  Is that hopes for a better earnings season overall?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I think so.  And you could look at -- what's interesting is the market looked at all of that and parsed out the good news and didn't dwell on the bad news.  And we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which was a complete flip from what we're seeing --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The whole last quarter was -- let's find any piece of bad news and sell into it.  And we have the regional banks reporting mostly this week, and that's really closer to where the job creation is in this country.  So, it looks like the regional banks are adding to the loan book, and they're strong, it may be a good sign that money is going into small business, which is the real job creator of the country.</p><p>BOLTON:  I actually think we are going to hear some good news from them because if you looked at Bank of America's results, you know, one of their biggest things that moved the needle, positively, was lending, lending to all of us.  It was the credit business.  It was the debit business.  So we should actually hear some good news, if that's in any indication.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we got good news from Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve saying we will be patient over and over and over again.  Whether it was short term interest rate increases, but also looking at the balance sheet reduction, aware of the market's concerns about that.</p><p>And Maria, on Friday, on Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, spoke to Dick Bove, from Rafferty Capital Markets, about the Fed's decision to keep interest rates, steady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think the Fed caved to the President, don't you?</p><p>DICK BOVE, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RAFFERTY CAPITAL MARKETS:  Oh, I don't think there's any question about it.  I think that one by one, these guys who've swung, recognizing that the Fed can't take that type of negative publicity on a constant basis from someone of that statue.  They just can't take it.  So, they cave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Victoria, maybe the Federal Reserve caved to the markets.  We're in complete disarray.  The credit markets were messy.  People are having very hard trouble, even buying and selling and pricing higher grade debt.  There was high yield debt issuance in the month of December.  So, and, again, there was massive volatility in every corner of the financial markets.</p><p>So, what do you think the Fed does?  Is the Fed on hold?  Have they placated the markets enough for the next three months?</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  Yes.  I'm not sure that I would say the Fed actually caved to the President.  I do think all along, the Fed has been saying that they were going to be data dependent.  They just saw the data as much more positive as I think the market did.  And what they have done over the past month is, Powell has come out and really kind of taken the patient word that you were talking about.  They're going to take a little bit of time.</p><p>So, maybe they're on hold for a little bit, but we still anticipate that with the strong consumer they were seeing, if earnings continue the way they are, if we get this GDP growth and, you know, around the 2-1/2 percent, then, I think we're going to see them continue to raise, maybe once in the first half of this year, and maybe a second time in the second half of the year.</p><p>So, I don't think they're done with this hiking cycle but I definitely think we're going to see a pause before they make another move.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, Victoria, I have a question for you.  So, we -- today's day --</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  Sure.</p><p>FOWLER:  -- 31, tomorrow would be day 32 of this shutdown.  At what point does this shutdown start to truly impact the market and truly impact how folks make their trading decisions?</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  You know, if you look at estimates right now, the direct effects, you know, missing their paychecks, is about 0.3 percent annualized on GDP.  The indirect effects are about the same.  Indirects, being contractors and things like that, as well as the market missing some of the economic reporting.</p><p>And that's where I think you're going to see the uncertainty come back into the market.  If we're not getting retail sales numbers, if we're not getting housing numbers, it's hard for investors to then project out what they think the markets going to do, going forward and invest accordingly.</p><p>So, that's where I think it's going to get hit the most.  You're looking if it goes -- the shutdown goes through the first quarter, about a one percent hit to GDP annualized.  So hopefully, we get something this week to kind of take some of that uncertainty off the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe some of the CEOs coming out and hammering all of these lawmakers and these politicians about them not working and not getting a deal done, rather than, you know -- rather than stepping back and trying to make nice-nice with the folks in Washington.  Come out and start hammering them in those -- in those earnings calls. We shall see.</p><p>Victoria, thank you so much.  Good to see you.</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Victoria Fernandez.  Meantime, wireless carriers stepping up the fight against robocalls, Cheryl Casone has the details, hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  AT&amp;T has been offering free robocall-blocking tool since two years ago.  AT&amp;T says it has blocked nearly 4.4 billion robocalls since October 2016.  There's also blocked over 360 million fraud calls.  And this year, Verizon Wireless subscribers are going to finally get a free robocall blocking app in March, taking a look at shares of AT&amp;T, up eight percent, so far, this year.</p><p>Well, this may be hard to swallow for beer drinkers, but starting next month Bud Light is going to have prominent labels, showing the beer's nutritional information and ingredients, and yes, the calories.

Coming up, three in a row, the Patriots beating the Chiefs to earn a spot in the Super Bowl, for the third straight year, and the Saints won't be marching to the big game, the controversial no-call that's got the sports world talking, more, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Super Bowl LIII is all set, but not without some controversy.  Jared Max has the details, Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Dagen.  And nothing worse in sports than getting burned by the officials.  The third straight year, Super Bowl will feature the New England Patriots.  Super Bowl LIII will be played 17 years in the day since the Patriots beat the Ram since Super Bowl 36 where the dynasty began.  They were underdogs in Kansas City, but the Patriots blew a 14-0 lead, found themselves trailing, so Sony Michel, fourth and inches, fourth-quarter touchdown and the Pats go in front.  But less than 90 seconds later, the Chiefs would score.  Later the Patriots would be able to still get in position to do what they could to setup to get a game tying field goal.</p><p>The Patriots eventually -- Rex Burkhead would score a touchdown and the game would wind up going to overtime.  Thanks to the leg of Greg Zuerlein, who would go 48-yards to force O.T. for the Chiefs.  And then, in overtime, Red Burkhead, with the game-winning touchdown, Patriots go all the way down to their first drive -- and New England is in the Super Bowl, winning 37-31.</p><p>The NFC championship also went overtime.  Major controversy.  The Saints were in position to win the game and run out the clock.  But watch what happened as the official somehow did not call pass interference on this play.  Certainly, it should have been called; the Saints should have been able to keep the drive going, run out the clock, go for a field goal, a touchdown, but instead they have to go for a field goal and that puts them then back in front.  But it was enough time for the Rams, who then got setup, and the Rams scored a game-tying field goal and then in overtime.  They would win it on a Greg Zuerlein 57-yard field goal, the longest field goal in NFL playoff history.  So, Super Bowl LIII, all set.  It will be the Rams against the Patriots just like a 17 years ago.  The Rams opened as a one-point favorite; now the Patriots are favored to win by a point-and-a-half.  The Rams are going to wear those all blue and yellow throwback uniforms.</p><p>Is it time for pass interference to be a reviewable call?  Saints head coach, Sean Payton, was livid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN PAYTON, HEAD COACH, SAINTS:  For a call like that not to be made is just hard to swallow, and then to get a phone call that would call -- it should never -- not going to call.  They said not only was its interference (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  The NFL will publicly admit: the officials missed the calls.  Payton was told by the refs, they missed it.  What does that do for them?</p><p>Phil Mickelson was in position when \"The Desert Classic.\"  Lefty, though, didn't get the job done at the final round.  He shot at 69 as Adam Long found himself all the way at the top of the leader board, lefty comes up short after an amazing start.  \"The Desert Classic,\" Adam Long, wins it by one.  Both games in overtime, what more could we ask for?  The Saints can cry about a missed call, but you want to know what, they left points on the board, the first two drives of the game.  And as a Minnesota Vikings fan, watching my team lose to the Saints nine years ago on the NFC title game burned, and that only happened because that bounty.  They put up a bounty on Brett Favre.  So, you know what, Saints, congratulations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, so you're saying that karma is a --</p><p>MAX:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She has a (INAUDIBLE) with a very long memory.</p><p>MAX:  She's a beautiful --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it comes back to bite you.  But again, this is what hurts, I think the NFL in the game, is when -- so you're going to come out and say and admit that this no-call was a mistake, but what does that accomplish unless you're going to go back and replay it?</p><p>MAX:  Nothing.  You know how much money it costs, how much money Saints don't earn as a team, as a business by not going to the Super Bowl?  All the money legally bet on this -- you have to make some changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do the Rams have a shot against the Patriots, though?</p><p>MAX:  I think the Patriots, if they were able to beat the Chiefs in Kansas City, I think that they're going to win the Super Bowl and beat the Rams.  Great matchup; the youngest coach, Sean McVay, turns 33 this week against the eldest -- the most tenured coach in Bill Belichick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Tom Brady is like, what, 72?</p><p>MAX:  74, and still winning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, yes, I'm was just going to say, the first time he won the Super Bowl, right.  Since then, we've had -- I was actually making a list for the tech conversation: iPhone, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, FitBit, none of those existed when Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl.</p><p>FOWLER:  But that was definitely an amazing night in football.</p><p>MAX:  It's great.  Two overtimes.</p><p>FOWLER:  Two overtimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, and that's what makes people watch the game, that what makes people watch Super Bowl.  Good to see you.</p><p>MAX:  Good to see you.  Happy Monday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I feel sorry for the Saints, though.</p><p>MAX:  I do, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just -- I can't, I can't help it, because New Orleans is just awesome -- just in general.  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115.  Coming up, it's Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  We talk about his message of gratitude and how gratitude can impact your well-being.  And it's that time of the year, when the winter blues really sad end.  What you can do to stave off (INAUDIBLE), rub some sunshine on your face.  That's how.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Today, we honor the life, the legacy of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Dr. King, known for his courageousness and faith but maybe, most of all, his gratitude.  This quote by Dr. King: \"Words can never adequately express appreciation.  Real appreciation must flow from the deep seas of the heart.\"  Show that trait and civil rights icon.  Joining me now is the author of \"Just Breathe,\" Mallika Chopra.  Mallika, Dr. King would actually write letters of gratitude to his supporters, what do you thinks about this and this can carry us through every day of our lives and make us a better society?</p><p>MALLIKA CHOPRA, AUTHOR:  So, gratitude actually -- recent research even shows the benefits in terms of physical health, emotional and mental health, as well as building empathy, helps you sleep better.  So, the simple practice of gratitude actually has real health benefits as well.  But on a day like today, I think we can really feel grateful for great leaders and role models in our life who have really transform society, and then we can learn ourselves about the power of dreaming of having gratitude and also teaching our children these skills.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard, so gratitude is your word of the year.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is my word of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you have a (INAUDIBLE) that you're showing us.  How do you -- and you can get in here but how do you integrate gratitude into your life every day?  Like, what is -- give, literally, an actually plan, seems so simple but sometimes it's not.</p><p>CHOPRA:  So, it is actually simple.  You can start with just practicing or saying what you're grateful for every night before you go to sleep.  Think about your day.  And if you're a parent, maybe you share something with your child that you're grateful for or ask them to think about gratitude -- what they're grateful for.</p><p>FOWLER:  I think that's such an interesting point, especially like I think we live in a culture where it moves so quickly and everybody is upset about the line or the elevator not coming on time, or the train being late.  So, how do we, in this society, as we get into this new year, like really have an attitude for gratitude given that we live in this impatient world.</p><p>CHOPRA:  So, I think it's about learning how to self-regulate -- and that's why title of my book is \"Just Breathe.\"  That just takes how do we pause and actually shift our attitude?  And we can really do that -- I challenge people sometimes try to go through one hour of the day without criticizing, complaining or condemning someone else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have a good tip.</p><p>CHOPRA:  And you'll realize.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go through one hour and don't start any sentence you use with I.</p><p>CHOPRA:  It's a great one.  That's a great one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to ask this though, today is Blue Monday, and I suffer with this.  Like, I take massive doses of vitamin D.  So, this is apparently the most depressing day of the year.  It's because, we're past the shortest day of the year, so it's not the lack of sunshine may be, but again, this is when they've given up on their resolutions by now, bad weather, it's cold out.  How do we shake that?</p><p>CHOPRA:  So, one, the Blue Monday concept, I hope that people don't let other people influence them to feel depressed.  I know today is one of the coldest days of the year here in New York.  And I think, again, it's starting the day with what is my intention today.  So, my intention today is to appreciate others, to feel gratitude.  And once you shift your dialogue, your internal dialogue, you'll start noticing the positives.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is.  Thank you so much.</p><p>FOWLER:  Just breathe.</p><p>CHOPRA:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Meditate people.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, January 21st.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>The shutdown showdown enters day 31.  President Trump making an offer to end the shutdown but the Democrats showed no signs of compromise yet.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle speaking out on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it may take some work but I think we can get there.  Look, we've got provisions in here that the Democrats have indicated they very much want.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that there's ways to do that.  So if we all know that we want to do something about DACA, we all know that we immediately want to open up our government, then we know that the problem is border security.  So let's sit down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the battle to fund that border wall.</p><p>U.S. markets are closed to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. today.  But the futures are trading and we have some losses across the board.  A 98-point loss on the Dow futures; this after the markets have posted gains of more than 2.5 percent across the board.  That was since the close on January the 11th.</p><p>Checking global market action in Europe, we have losses in France and Germany, a little bit of a gain on the FTSE 100 in England.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the board, despite a report out of China showing the economy there grew last year at its slowest pace since 1990.  We have gains across the board.</p><p>Again, there's a big slowdown but some of this is maybe engineered by Xi Jinping, trying to contain the debt levels in the country and fend off financial risk.  That's been his project for the last three years and this is some of the fallout potentially.</p><p>Then of course, this trade battle with the United States.  Do we get a trade deal done?

Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, PWC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Fox News contributor Richard Fowler.  Welcome one and all.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome and hello.  Happy Monday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all about the love today.</p><p>FOWLER:  It is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All about the love.  And again, no love in Washington but we have plenty here.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  We have plenty to go around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Maria is taking joy overseas.  She is already in Davos, Switzerland.  And she will be live there from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland starting tomorrow.</p><p>She's going to be speaking one on one with Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Ginni Rometty IBM's chief and Microsoft president Brad Smith, SAP's CEO Bill McDermott, plus Brian Moynihan.  He's got something to cheer -- he's the CEO of Bank of America.  They had some good results last week.</p><p>Meantime, the government shutdown entering day 31 -- its impact rippling across the nation.  Democrats rejecting President Trump's bid to reopen the government that offered three years of DACA protections for the Dreamers -- those young people who came here as illegal immigrants and are still in this country.  He's offering that in exchange for border wall funding.  He wants $5.7 billion.</p><p>This as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is said to be preparing to call a vote on the President's offer to protect Dreamers combining it with legislation passed by House Democrats to fund government agencies through the fiscal year.</p><p>Joining me now is an entrepreneur whose business has been affected by the shutdown, TapRm founder Jason Sherman.  Jason -- good to see you.</p><p>JASON SHERMAN, FOUNDER TAPRM:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tell us all how -- what's going on with the business and how this has been hurt by the shutdown.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Absolutely.  TapRm is about four, five months old and we were looking to help small craft brewers from around the country, more costlessly (ph) and risklessly (ph) come to New York.  And then hopefully further out into the country.</p><p>And we were opened up with just a distribution business but mostly an online business but a big part of the three channels that we wanted to open was a retail store so people could come and experience, taste, have a whole experience or moment with all the brands that we carry as well as other New York City breweries.</p><p>We opened up the store, built it out, had it ready to go, anticipating that our license would be cleared to go by the federal regulatory bodies in early January.  Every week that goes by, there's more lease running, it's more expense on us, it's more breweries that we can't be taking on.</p><p>So right now we're anticipating about $1,500 to $2,000 a day in lost sales as well as a hold on a whole lot of business functions that we were hoping to get going at this point.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So two questions, quickly.  Which agency is it that's closed and what impact does that have on your employees, because the ripple effect is it's not just the 800,000 government employees, it's your employees that won't be getting paid potentially because your business hasn't opened.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Absolutely.  It's the TTB, which is the regulatory oversight body for all alcohol at the federal level.  It's the regulatory body.</p><p>As far as the employees go, from our two other channels, they've been working much harder, right.  So they've been pushing themselves, working overtime, usually for less money in order to increase the sales and make up for the fact that we don't have a retail component.</p><p>On the retail side, we had four retail managers ready to go, ready to start working.  They've been put on hold.</p><p>There's only so long that I am able to keep them around before I need to tell them, you guys, it's time to go find another job.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So Jason -- do you have investors?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Not at this time.  I'm self-funding this right now.  I'm trying to prove (ph) out the trio of channels as a good disruptive model for beer distribution before I go raise money.  There's only so long I can go on my own funds, my only worth for about seven years before this.  Some of this was from inherited money.  And there's only so much longer I can go before I can prove out a contest (ph).</p><p>FOWLER:  So Jason -- I mean the President watches this show quite a bit.  And you're a young entrepreneur.  Everything we want you to be, right.  What is your message to him and lawmakers in Congress today?</p><p>SHERMAN:  I would hope that the President and all lawmakers see the needs of not just the 800,000 federal employees but also the small business owners which I know everyone here and everyone in the country would agree should not become victim to something going on at the legislative level.</p><p>We should be supporting our small businesses.  And I would really hope he sees that.  He sees the pain we're going to through on a daily basis.</p><p>It's much harder than just waking up in the morning and not having a retail store.  It's constantly losing, right.  It's losing money, going out of business, laying people off -- that would be bad.</p><p>As a young guy, I took the leap from corporate America about four months ago to try and live this American dream and really these kind of roadblocks are devastating.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BOLTON:  And this is basically just the licensing issues (INAUDIBLE).  I mean you're really just waiting for yes, this business does have a legal acknowledgement.</p><p>SHERMAN:  It's even simpler than that.  We're actually approved already in Rochester.  We just need a slight transfer.  So I've been approved.  The business has been approved.  I just need the license to be transferred to Brooklyn.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  New York State's given you everything you need, right.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is a federal issue.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is your backup plan, though?  Like how long can you -- because you have the managers in place -- like, what are the next steps if the government doesn't open?</p><p>SHERMAN:  So I think we can hang on for another few weeks before we're having to make any dire decisions.  My next steps would be to reconsider the model.  If we cannot open retail stores in the state --</p><p>BOLTON:  Could you get short-term funding?</p><p>SHERMAN:  I would probably have to look into short-term funding sources, including friends and family who have all been extremely supportive in trying to help me out during this time to branch over until when it's cleared.</p><p>FOWLER:  So Jason -- what's your daily burn rate as this government shutdown goes on?  Like this is day 31.  How much money will your company lose today?</p><p>SHERMAN:  I think as of today, it's hard to say.  But we were anticipating a January 5th opening.  So now, it's been about three weeks.  And so every day, around $1,500 to $2,000 in lost sales.  So if we add that up I think every day it just goes a little bit further.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you -- leaving the corporate world -- being an entrepreneur, are you angry at the people in Washington that they can't -- and again, not to get into the politics of it -- but that you have all these very smart people who can't come up with some compromise?</p><p>SHERMAN:  I don't think angry is the right word.  I think as a small business entrepreneur and especially the TapRm entrepreneur in some sense, you run into roadblocks every day, whether that's the big players out there, people telling you you're not going to be Amazon.  You're never going to be Anheuser-Busch Inbev.</p><p>You hear these things all day long.  This is just one of those roadblocks you don't expect.  So anger is not the word.  It's just another roadblock.  I'd like to carry on from -- it's not something I anticipated and really hoped wouldn't be there at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, on this day honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. anger is not the word.  I think that that was very well said.  Not intentional on this day of celebration, but words of wisdom from a young entrepreneur.</p><p>And we do hope that --</p><p>SHERMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- we all hope that the government reopens, because again the TSA, the -- I read that the National Transportation Safety Board isn't doing any investigations.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Farmers have been hurt.  Food inspections.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  How about student loan -- you can't get a student loan because you may need some tax information and you can't get it from the IRS.</p><p>FOWLER:  The IRS.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The IRS is -- no small business administration loans are being approved right now.</p><p>So Jason -- thank you for telling your story.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jason Sherman -- and come back.</p><p>BOLTON:  We wish you luck.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  TapRm, the founder.</p><p>Coming up, global power shift -- the new report that China's economic growth is its slowest in nearly 30 years.</p><p>Plus, if you need some spiritual guidance, there's an app for that.  Details on the Catholic Church's first ever app where you can pray with the Pope.  Coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.</p><p>Let's take a look at the European markets.  The U.S. markets are closed for the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday today.  We have some mixed markets in Europe to tell you about.  Losses, although very slight on the CAC 40 in France and the DAX in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets closing higher overnight despite that news that China's economy grew at the slowest pace since 1990 -- almost three decades.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- interesting point about those markets going higher, is it because of a popular stimulus.  That's one way of thinking about those numbers.</p><p>China's fourth quarter GDP grew 6.4 percent -- that pulled full year growth down to 6.6 percent.  That's the slowest annual pace like you just said, Dagen, since 1990.  That's got people scratching their heads.</p><p>China's economy has been under pressure from weakening domestic demand and escalating U.S. tariffs.  The jobless rate also jumped up to 4.9 percent last month from 4.8 percent back in November.  A lot of layoffs being reported in Shenzhen which is where auto parts are made.  Think about that, folks.</p><p>All right.  A gasoline pipeline explosion and an illegal tap in central Mexico has now claimed at least 85 lives and there are still 65 reports of missing persons.  This blast happened Friday about 70 miles north of Mexico City.  This tragedy coming in the midst of a crackdown by Mexican President Obrador on widespread fuel theft from these pipelines.  Again -- this was an illegal tap on that pipeline.</p><p>And then get this, Pope Francis now has an app.  He launched it during his traditional Sunday address in St. Peter's Square over the weekend.  The new app is called Click to Pray.  It will inform the user what the leader of the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics are praying for such as world peace, so they can join him.  The new platform coincides with World Youth Day 2019 which kicks off in Panama tomorrow.</p><p>The Pope getting cool, Dagen, on the apps.  Love it.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to reach more people.</p><p>CASONE:  It's one way to do it.  Get the youth out there.  They're all on their phones anyway 24/7.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>CASONE:  So, reach them that way.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, e-cigarettes could go up in smoke.  The FDA warning it could pull all vaping products off store shelves completely.  We have the details.</p><p>Plus, the most popular puppy on Instagram is here.  We're waiting for -- ok we're waiting for the Pomeranian social media star.  We can't wait for this.  Coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FDA looking to crack down on e-cigarettes if companies continue marketing to teens.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti is here with the details.  Hey -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Yes.  Stop marketing to teens or your days may be numbered is the message from the Food and Drug Administration.  The commissioner, Scott Gottlieb -- he spoke during a public hearing Friday.  He followed up with this tweet on Saturday.  \"I believe if every currently addicted adult smoker switched completely to e-cigs it would provide a tremendous public health gain.  But that opportunity is in significant risk if kids use continues to rise.  There's an opportunity now for responsible parties to address youth use.\"</p><p>Here are the numbers.  One in five high school students say they vape.  That's three million and that number has nearly doubled in just one year.</p><p>The FDA calls the issue an epidemic.  It's come down hard on e-cigarette makers including Juul which is the dominant player in the industry, 75 percent market share.  Juul has pulled some popular flavors from store shelves, shut down most of its social media and added age verification to its Web site.</p><p>But the FDA wants to see a drastic reduction in underage vaping or it warns that the entire industry will, quote, \"face an existential threat\".</p><p>Here's the statement from Juul.  \"Underage use of Juul and any other vaping products is completely unacceptable to us and is directly opposed to our mission of eliminating cigarettes by offering existing adult smokers a true alternative to combustible cigarettes.\"</p><p>One Juul pod contains the same amount of nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes.  So nicotine can affect adolescent brain development in different ways than adults.  So a vape-addicted kid can show signs of anxiety, the inability to focus or actually, ironically develop an addiction to traditional tobacco.</p><p>Speaking of traditional tobacco, we're looking at Altria shares, the maker of Marlboro.  They've taken just last month a 35 percent stake in Juul, valued that company at $38 billion.  That deal was supposed to ensure that big tobacco has a future with this new technology.  But after Gottlieb's comments, that future is now in doubt.</p><p>This is a big risk to the e-cigarette industry because of what it is doing to underage smokers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But other than the flavors, how do these companies market to teenagers?  Or how do the regulators allege that these companies market to teenagers?  ?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Making it look cool on social media.  In fact Juul took down -- they took all their social media except for Twitter.  And it was too easy to find in many, you know, stores where you get it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So my genius kids vape.</p><p>BOLTON:  They do?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, they do.  It's totally a social thing because, quote, unquote, \"everybody's doing it\".  You can get them so easily at the gas station.</p><p>BOLTON:  And in New York City, wherever you can buy candy and soda, I think you can buy them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But aren't there age restrictions?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There are.  But for some reason, you know, the basic suburban gas station they're not --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not carding them.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- carding the kids.  They buy that and Twinkies at the same time.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And your kids are 18, though.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  They are, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So they can.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I think it's -- I don't know the answer, it maybe 21 like regular tobacco.  But for some reason they hold it in this other category.  And I think it's a problem.</p><p>The other thing that's a huge issue is because there's so much nicotine in it, there's so many kids that are taking anxiety meds and all of these others --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a great point.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Those two things don't mix, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Adderall and all of those things do not mix with nicotine.  So it's a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I hear a story of parental responsibility.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  In this particular story?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, but in general.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again it always raises the question of where are the parents here.</p><p>BOLTON:  I do know the 14 or 15-year-olds who buy it --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Middle school.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  Coming out of school, they're walking home from school.  So maybe at 14 or 15, the parents aren't walking them home from school.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The other thing is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But again, you don't know that your kid has these cigarettes in the house.  You don't know that the kids --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of the kids don't know the flavors have nicotine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- again, you can't smell them.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  They think, oh this is minty.  This is cucumber.  They don't know it has --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- nicotine in it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know that there's nicotine in an e-cigarette.  If you take one pull on one and have never smoked a cigarette, you doggone well know that there's something in it that gives you pep in your step.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  One of the things is that the cartridges look just like flash drives.  And one of the reasons they were designed that way was so that people wouldn't know what they were because they look like a flash drive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Parents and teachers, right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Parents and teachers didn't know, they thought kids were passing around homework.</p><p>BOLTON:  I do know some schools have really cracked down.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  The K to 8 schools have said -- some of the private schools have said if we find you with this, you are out.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  K through 8 -- that is so disturbing --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- that we're talking about.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- that it's sixth, seventh and eighth graders.</p><p>FOWLER:  I mean it's just crazy to me because I remember being -- and I wasn't in high school that long ago where like being -- having a cigarette on campus was like, that's immediate suspension.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  These kids would never smoke a cigarette in a million years because they've been brain washed in a good way that cigarettes are bad.  They haven't been brain washed that e-cigarettes are bad.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  I've done a bunch of research on this and there are very negative effects on young -- it's great for adults, gets you off the traditional tobacco.  Both contain chemicals.</p><p>But for an adolescent brain, e-cigarettes and vaping is bad, the liquid nicotine.</p><p>FOWLER:  But I think what people miss is how much nicotine you intake when you use Juul over a regular, standard cigarette.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>FOWLDER:  It's like three or four times as much nicotine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  More than you think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One cartridge is one pack.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a whole pack of cigarettes --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in terms of the nicotine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And that is clearly on the Juul Web site.</p><p>BOLTON:  And I can actually -- you made this point that sometimes the kids who are vaping then eventually do got regular cigarettes, right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  It's sort of sets up the behavior.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This crazy addiction it forms.  And it's because their brain is still developing.  And I just gave you the high school numbers.  The middle school numbers are equally disturbing, if not more.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The future of the e-cigarettes is part of it is in marijuana and the idea -- the expectation that marijuana will -- not for kids but for the expectation that marijuana usage in more states certainly will be legal if not at the federal level.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  They're using the cartridges for e-cigarettes to smoke marijuana as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I'm saying that as a business proposition, it's the expectation that marijuana, it will be a delivery mechanism for marijuana products --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- down the road.  So we shall see.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  We have an addicted culture.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can kick cigarettes, trust me.  You can kick.  People say oh, -- no.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Or just never try them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Thank you.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Novel concept.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Novel concept.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where's our medication (ph) guy?</p><p>You talk about if you get suspended for a cigarette, when I first started working here in New York City 25 years ago we could still smoke at our desk --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  At our desk.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Really.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- in the office.  Yes, in a newsroom.</p><p>FOWLER:  And there's some places where you can still smoke in buildings.  I mean that's shocking, you know.  I said you can't smoke in here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you can't smoke at the doctor's office anymore.  That was something growing up too.</p><p>Thank you so much -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great story.</p><p>Coming up, more additions to the 2020 field.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz considering a presidential run but one Democrat in his home state says just don't.</p><p>Plus, brick by brick -- check out this fantastic Chevy Silverado, built entirely of Legos.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, January 21st.  Your top stories at 07:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Not so fast, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says that he might run for president in 2020.  But one Democratic leader telling him just don't.  The backlash straight ahead.</p><p>Meantime, U.S. markets are closed today in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Futures are showing this in early trading action.  The stock markets won't open but we do have Futures trading until the morning.  Dow Jones Futures are down 90 points at the moment, but this after the major market gauges finished higher for the fourth week in a row.  Check it out, this is the close last week.  We had three percent gains almost on all three major market gauges.</p><p>Global markets are open in Europe.  We have losses on the CAC Quarante in France and the DAX in Germany, although slight gain on the FTSE 100.</p><p>Asian markets ending higher overnight.  We have gains across the board.  That despite the news that China's economy grew at the slowest rate last year since 1990.  Growth even slowed more dramatically at the end of the year, in the fourth quarter.  But again, a sigh of relief in the markets in Asia, may be because that economy would get a lift if the trade deal gets done with the U.S., we shall see.  Negotiations ongoing there.</p><p>Meantime, the rising cost to eat, fast food becoming much more expensive.  We will tell you why.</p><p>Then, a blocky car or pickup truck, rather, details behind the full size Chevy Silverado made entirely of Legos.</p><p>And did you see it?  We've got some great shots from last night's super blood wolf moon.  This is me not doing my werewolf howl.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced that he is considering a run for president in 2020.  The head of the Democratic Party and Schultz's home state of Washington was quick to weigh in.</p><p>Tina Podlodowski, Washington state Democratic Party chairperson issuing this statement.  I have two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent.  Just don't.</p><p>Joining me now, America Fighting Back chairman, former presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  Why not run?  Good to see you, Herman.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHAIRMAN, AMERICA FIGHTING BACK PAC:  I have three words for Mr. Schultz, just save your money.  That's four words, I guess.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's some -- that's something I would do, but go ahead.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes, it's because here's what I know about running for president especially if he's going to do it as an independent.  In order to get the momentum to run as an independent, it takes probably two times as much money as it takes if you're going to run for one of the traditional parties.</p><p>So, I would agree.  I think it's wasting his money.  He's going to provide jobs for somebody for a while but I don't think it's going to go anywhere.  So that, I would agree with some of the people who are asking him not to, not because he's not a smart person.  Just simply because it's an uphill battle if you run as an independent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to break down with this that Senator Kamala Harris officially saying that she is running for the Democratic nomination.  Kamala Harris, the Senator from California officially running for the presidency.</p><p>I want to get back to Howard.  I'll get you to weigh in on that, Herman.  But getting back to Howard Schultz, is it difficult for him because he would run as an independent potentially and not be backed and like one of the two main parties?  Number one. Number two, why -- I think people -- didn't we all learn not to dismiss somebody after what Donald Trump was able to achieve?</p><p>CAIN:  But Donald Trump did not try to run as an independent.  If you try to run as an independent, you have to establish your credentials in all 50 states individually.  There is no across the board credentials awarded to somebody running as an independent.  That's number one.</p><p>So, him running versus a Donald Trump are two different thing.  Trump chose the Republican Party and if Schultz is thinking about -- if he's really thinking about running as an independent, I happen to think that that would be a huge mistake and he will spend a whole lot of money going nowhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard, I want to just get you to weigh in on Kamala Harris officially saying that she is running for the presidency, doing this on \"Good Morning America\" this morning, of course on this day every year that we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  She's a daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and has quiet quickly made a name for herself in the Senate.  But it's going to be a crowded field, my friend.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's going to be absolutely be a crowd.  It's going to be like -- it's going to be like church on Easter, I tell you. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>But here's the thing.  Church on Easter is good for the Democratic Party for a couple of reasons.  One, I think just like we saw the Republicans do in the last cycle, as you get a chance to talk about your ideals, what ideals work for the country, where is your base, where are the American people and really having a conversation with the American people.  So, I'm happy to see a crowded field.</p><p>I actually agree with Herman on the ideal of not running as an independent.  I mean, that is a huge, huge, huge operation.  You have to get signatures in all 50 states.  You don't have a party infrastructure to help you do some of that work.  You don't have field soldiers like you have a lot of work to do and it's going to cost you billions of dollars.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, I'm kind of actually curious as to why he would because he has described himself publicly numerous times as a life-long Dem.  So, I don't know if he just wants control of his own campaign.  I mean, to the point about the money, he does -- he's worth north of $3 billion.  So I mean, he could even -- you know, spend a couple hundred million and probably if that's a goal and a dream, I guess it's worth it.  But it is curious or I'm kind of curious as to why he wouldn't.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, here's a question for you, Mr. Cain.  I mean, is it -- is it not possible that he's running to get ideals out there.  I mean, when you ran, you get ideals out there as well into the party infrastructure.  And maybe that's why he's running, I'm going to use my money and get my ideals out to the marketplace via presidential campaign.</p><p>CAIN:  It could be, but I don't know for sure.  However, I haven't heard any of his ideas or any of his ideals that would capture the public.  And allow me to comment on Kamala Harris very quickly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  Kamala Harris would be one of a crowded field of socialist, that's all they are.  They aren't proposing any centrist Democratic ideals.  Most of them are trying to get attention and to get their ideals out there as previously stated by going to the far, far, far left.</p><p>So, I don't think that Middle America -- I don't think that most people in America are ready for a socialist to be president of the United States of America --</p><p>FOWLER:  Mr. Cain, why is she -- why is she a socialist?  I mean, that's a -- that's a heavy claim.  I mean, what -- how you -- how do you --</p><p>CAIN:  I know it's a heavy claim.  Have you listened to some of the things she has supported?</p><p>FOWLER:  Like what?</p><p>CAIN:  She supports Medicare for all.  That is a socialist idea that has never worked anywhere in the world.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, every American had been able to going to the doctors is socialism?</p><p>CAIN:  No, you're twisting it into what the benefits might be.</p><p>FOWLER:  No, I'm just --</p><p>CAIN:  No, let me finish.  Allow me to finish.  Look at the countries who have tried Medicare for all, controlled by the government.  Long-term it does not work.  So, don't give me this --</p><p>FOWLER:  Canada, the United Kingdom, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden.</p><p>CAIN:  No, it doesn't.  Why don't you talk -- see, this is what you all do --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, I'll point this out -- but, I'll point this out, Herman, the Medicare for all proposal that Bernie Sanders has delivered in Washington that has been backed by Kamala Harris, backed by Elizabeth Warren, backed by Corey Booker, it gets rid of Medicare as we know it and it gets rid of private insurance, that private insurance would not be allowed to exist under, quote, Medicare -- this Medicare for all proposal.  There would be no competition allowed for the government plan.</p><p>And so that is the issue, it is a complete takeover.  It's not Britain's system but it's a complete takeover of the insurance system in this country.  And that -- whether you want to call it socialist or not, it is a great deal of more government intervention into our health insurance system.</p><p>CAIN:  That's the problem.  It is total government control of our health insurance and healthcare system.  That's what's wrong.  There's another way to solve the problem that makes sure that everybody gets covered.</p><p>I want to go all the way back to pre-Obamacare.  The building was -- had a -- had a leak in the roof, 20 percent of the people needed coverage.  80 percent of the people were just fine with the coverage that they were getting through their employer or individually.</p><p>But the Democrats decided to blow up the whole system and now it is in shambles.  And now the alternative is -- allow me to finish.  Now the alternative is, let's just do government controlled Medicare for all.  You can point to these other countries but people never talk about the people that are suffering because of this government controlled healthcare.  Government controlled insurance on top of government controlled healthcare is a bad proposition for the United States of America in my opinion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the Republicans had the opportunity when they controlled the House and the Senate to fix what was wrong with President Obama's healthcare plan and they couldn't do it.  And they didn't do it.  So, it's on --</p><p>CAIN:  They couldn't -- no, they couldn't do all of the things, Dagen, because certain things that they wanted to do would have required 60 votes.  They couldn't get the 60 votes.  So they did what they could do based upon being able to get 51 votes.  That's why they did --</p><p>FOWLER:  But Mr. Cain, there were Republicans that voted against the Donald Trump's plan to repeal and replace, number one.  And number two, aren't there -- like, if you talk to the American people, well, the Affordable Care Act is very popular.  If you talk to parents who have kids in college, they'll say though, this is very popular, my kid can go to the doctor while they're in college.  That's a big deal.</p><p>So, I mean, I think a leaky roof is might not be the best analogy.  I think it was more like there was a hole in the roof and it was raining.</p><p>CAIN:  No, the leaky roof analogy that I gave is the best analogy.  Now, the people that you are talking or to -- talking to who say that they like it, that's fine.  Why don't you talk to the millions of people who do not like it?  Why don't you talk to the people that I talk to when I travel, when I do my show or whatever the case may be?  You can always find an exception that said, this is a good thing.  But --</p><p>FOWLER:  But the majority of Americans like the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>CAIN:  Will you -- are you going to let me finish my statement or what?</p><p>FOWLER:  Via Gallup, via the poll.</p><p>CAIN:  See, there you go.  You interrupt before I fish my thought.  I'm simply saying you're not talking to enough people that are not happy with it.  You could always find an exception that says that they like it if it satisfies your goal politically of getting something like Medicare for all.  I don't agree with it and most Americans don't agree with it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, I'll leave it this with you, whatever word you want to use -- the danger that the Democrats who want to win the nomination for 2020, the danger that they will encounter is they all push each other so far left that you have to be far -- you know, on the far left to win the nomination but then what does that do for you in the general?  We shall see.  Kamala Harris definitely running for the nomination.</p><p>CAIN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That field is going to get a lot more crowded and we expect you back to weigh in on it, sir.  Good to see you.</p><p>CAIN:  Be happy to.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman Cain, take care.</p><p>Still ahead, a rare sight in the night sky, we'll show you more shots from last night's super blood wolf moon.</p><p>Plus Instagram's cutest and most popular dog, that's JiffPom is here live.  Hi, sweetie pie.  Hi, sweetie pie.  What's going on?  I'm a dog person.  Do you love me?  Yes, yes.  You will hear me do my dog voice with JiffPom.  She has her own toys coming out.  We're looking at big business of being a social media star when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The super villain takes the top spot at the Box Office.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, good movie weekend actually considering the weather, Dagen.  Not quite the blockbuster some had expected.  But the movie \"Glass\" nevertheless dominated the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday weekend.  It earned nearly $41 million in ticket sales.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH PAULSON, ACTRESS AS DR. ELLIE STAPLE, GLASS:  I specialize in those individuals who believe they are superheroes.</p><p>JAMES MCAVOY, ACTOR AS KEVIN WENDELL CRUMB, GLASS:  Good for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Great cast.  Some industry forecasts had gone as high as $75 million over four days for \"Glass\".  But poor reviews to take some of the momentum away from it.</p><p>Now, \"The Upside\" with Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston came in second with nearly $16 million, \"Aquaman\" third, followed by the Japanese animated film \"Dragon Ball Super: Broly\" and \"Spider-man: Into The Spider-Verse\" rounding out the top five there.</p><p>All right, check this out, Chevy has built a life-size 2019 Silverado pickup truck with Legos, Maria Bartiromo.  As part of its partnership with the \"Lego Movie 2\", she would die for this.  It took 18 specially trained Lego builders more than 2,000 hours to put more than 33,000 Lego pieces together.  The model is 240 inches long, weighs over 3,000 pounds.  They unveiled it at the Detroit auto show which still is going on and it runs through January 27th.  \"The Lego Movie 2\" is going to hit theaters actually early next month.</p><p>And then, we had quite the show last night, we talked about it Friday, some stunning images from the very rare super blood wolf moon.  People around the world looked at this.  The moon entered earth's shadow.  It was this year's only total lunar eclipse.  And it was visible for its entirety in North and South America.  The next total lunar eclipse is going to not be around until May 26 of 2021.</p><p>Of course, I was telling Maria, she should send somebody to the beach to get one of her amazing moon beach shots but we'll just see.  It looked gorgeous though, a lot of great shots of it though, especially from New York, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Cheryl Casone.</p><p>Coming up, Instagram's most popular dog is live in the studio.  JiffPom and I will use my doggie voice to communicate with JiffPom in the next segment.  We talk about the business of being a social media star, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The big business of being a social media star, JiffPom, the most popular dog on Instagram, nearly nine million followers, about 28 million followers across multiple platforms.  And JiffPom is launching a new toy line this week called CuteLife.  Joining me now is JiffPom CuteLife collaborator Heather Rodriguez and JiffPom.</p><p>JiffPom, it's so nice to meet you, buddy.  You're adorable.  Please don't get up and -- yes, I'm very worried about you.  Don't move -- don't move.  You'll get lots of treats later.  Heather, tell me how you ended up working with JiffPom.</p><p>HEATHER RODRIGUEZ, COLLABORATOR, JIFFPOM CUTELIFE:  So, we just fell in love with JiffPom, obviously.  He's beyond adorable.  And he has almost nine million followers on Instagram.  So, we really just wanted to bring his cuteness into the homes of everywhere.  So, we decided to make a toy line and we made collectibles.  We have eight collectibles and we also have plush.  So, and they're exclusively at Wal-Mart.  And you can get the collectibles, they're $8.88 each.  And they're really great price.  Again, he was just really great to work with.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, he is amazing.  So, his mom is standing off camera.  You can come in a little bit closer.  Just so he can see you.  So, just stand right there so he can see you.  That's why he's -- you're not on camera.  That's why he's barking, by the way, because he's looking for -- because his mom was standing behind the light and he couldn't see her.</p><p>So, JiffPom -- but how did you end up -- how did this come to be?  Because again, JiffPom's only -- he's a little boy, only 3 years old, so --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, so we really just -- we reached out and we saw how cute he was and we just thought it would be really great for everyone to be able to bring him into the homes and it really is great since he has a great digital presence, it's not just a one-time purchase.</p><p>We're able to bring the old school way of creativity and play value for all children and still the new school way of digital.  Everyone, kids right now are online.  They always want to be online.  So, JiffPom by getting his toys, he's still online every day, giving you content.  He's still -- he's on Musical.ly, he's on TikTok, he's on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think he wants a treat.  Does he want -- does he want a treat?  Is that what he wants?</p><p>BOLTON:  Or his followers -- I mean, I'm assuming his followers we know are worldwide.  But I'm assuming he's bigger in some places than others, right?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, he is.  He has a lot of internationally in Japan, you know, right now, they're really big into -- they're really big into Hello Kitty so now he's just a modern day version for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and even Pikachu, quite frankly.  Those kind of like touch stones of Japanese culture of how pretty and Pikachu, his little face, his sweet little face --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  And what's great is that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's almost -- I mean, JiffPom is a doggie but he's almost doll-like (INAUDIBLE).  He's just -- he just leads this fantastic life.</p><p>So, he broke three World Records, including becoming the fattest dog on two paws.  We will see -- we've got video of some of his tricks.  Right now we're just -- my gosh.</p><p>Yes, keep rolling that video so we can give him a treat.  JiffPom, you want to sit?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Sit.  Sit your bootie.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sit down, JiffPom.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, here's a question for you, so this toy, I mean, this is the most adorable dog ever on sitting right next to me.  But this toy, is it -- I mean, assuming this is a toy, yes, for children.  But like, is the marketplace kids of all ages?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  It really is.  What's really great about JiffPom is that the people have chosen him, right?  So it's not like every other cartoon or product that we're manufacturing and then we're telling children to play with him.  The people have chosen him.  So, it's been people of all ages.  You can create -- you can have these toys and every item is completely blind and they're really cute but also you can just have them for your desk and it's just a cute novelty situation where you --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  JiffPom, you are just like Charlie, you love a box being opened.  A box of vitamins shows up in the apartment and you think it is for you and it's imported for you.  This is going to be in Walmart -- these toys will be in Walmart.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, they're exclusively at Walmart.  And we have these little collectibles.  And basically we have -- this is like his little version of what we did.  And he was really particular actually in the look and feel of it, of the toy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  JiffPom, we have to wrap it up.  But JiffPom, you're welcome back anytime, sugar muffin and his mom, what a great mom.  Bye, JiffPom, you come back soon.  Yes, thank you sweetie pie.  Heather, thank you for being here.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The power of Netflix coming up, the streaming service announcing the spooky reboot of a popular show, next hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 21, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012103cb.231][Type: Show] [Head: Border Wall Funding Battle; Impact of Government Shutdown Ripples throughout the Nation; Interview with Rep.

It's Monday, January 21st.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>The shutdowns showdown day 31, President Trump making an offer to end the shutdown, but the Democrats show no signs of compromise, yet.  Lawmakers on both sides of it aisle speaking out to Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have existing border wall border fence whatever you want to call it.  The fund -- Democrats funded it for previous presidents including President Obama.  There's no reason to turn this down, particularly now, when we're reaching out in compromising on things that they want.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  Let's get in regular order, let's get in the rouge.  Let's all agree on border security a package, that will truly keep us safe, and let's reopen the government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the battle to fund the border wall and get this government back up and running.</p><p>U.S. markets are closed for the day honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  The Futures are trading this morning, NASDAQ is down, the most percentage wise of the three U.S. markets, NASDAQ 100.  U.S. Futures on the Dow down 95 points.</p><p>This after the major market gauges posted their fourth straight week of gains, look at them go.  The bank stocks in particular financing stocks had a winning week.</p><p>And checking global market action in Europe, we have losses in France and Germany.  A slight gain, ever so slight on the FTSE 100 in England.</p><p>Asia overnight gains across the board despite a report out of China showing the economy there grew at slowest pace last year, since 1990.  But again, there are things that the government can do to duce growth in that country.</p><p>The Central Bank injecting more cheap money into the banking system, we've already seen hat.  Maybe tax cuts for businesses and individuals.</p><p>Meantime, Super Bowl LIII set.  The Patriots head back to the big game for the third straight year.  But it was a controversial call -- well, no call, for the Saints.  The Rams took the win yesterday, and everybody is talking about that no call.  Even the NFL getting ready to issue a mea culpa.</p><p>Plus, the power of Netflix.  The streaming giant bringing back a popular T.V. show after \"Stranger Things\" became such a big hit.  We'll tell you what's coming back to Netflix.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  But Fox Business Network Deirdre Bolton, PWC partner Mitch Roschelle and Fox News contributor Richard Fowler.</p><p>So, I have to confess, with JiffPom, I'm just nervous --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It was a little nerve wrecking.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, JiffPom sitting on the -- sitting on the little stand.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, but what a cutie.  But yes, I agree, it was a little nerve wrecking</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we were used to like -- we were used to our own dogs and they don't have any depth perception.  My dog have zero depth perception and Charlie would have -- if he smelled a treat six blocks North of here, he would have leapt off.</p><p>BOLTON:  And I can also say, zero patience.  That dog is out there, very nice for a long time.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Very well trained.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can you believe, like nine million Instagram followers.</p><p>FOWLER:  Nine million followers.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  -- to get like 300.  You know, I just don't understand.</p><p>BOLTON:  But you have that cute dog, right?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I do have a cute dog who I brought on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" a couple -- a couple of months ago.  And I was saying to Deirdre  during the break, I've never been so nervous in my life on television having my dog barking his head off on live television.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Charlie was on Maria's show once, and I had him like his leash tied to a stool and he knocked the stool over and dragged the stool all the way across the studio.  I was like, I don't know where you're going bud but in terms of social media (INAUDIBLE).  Richard Fowler has the best social media profile of any --</p><p>FOWLER:  Not as good as JiffPom, really.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do get it, but that's a lot of follower.  You know what, better JiffPom than Kendall Jenner, how about that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Fair enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Be sure to join us tomorrow MORNINGS WITH MARIA is going to be live from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Maria already on the ground in Switzerland.  And she's going to be talking one-on-one, with Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Microsoft President Brad Smith, SAP CEO Bill McDermott, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.  You don't want to miss any of what Maria has happening in Davos.</p><p>To our top story this hour, the government shutdown hits day 31.  The congressional Democrats reject a new proposal from President Trump to end the shutdown.  Blake Burman at the White House with the very latest.  Blake, I have a follow-up for you, I'm sure, but go ahead, tell us what you know right now.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was a rare weekend address for President Trump here from the White House.  One on which he outlined his proposal but potentially end the stalemate the president continuing to insist on $5.7 billion in border wall funding.  His proposal also includes additional security measures like $805 million for drug detection technology, along with 2,750 more border agents in exchange for a three year legislative extension for DACA recipients and those who receive temporary protected status.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  These plans solve the immediate crisis.  And it is a horrible crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis, like we rarely see in our country.  And it provides humanitarian relief.  Delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  However, Democrats are calling that a nonstarter they say the government needs to reopen for the 25 percent of the government that is partially shut down, and then a discussion can continue on border security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  If he opens up the government, we'll discuss whatever he offers but hostage taking should not work.  Even his own supporters agree that this is a bad tactic and that it's very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.</p><p>BURMAN:  So, here's the way forward, Dagen.  The Republican controlled Senate is going to put the president's proposal up for a vote this week while the Democrat controlled House is going to continue to pass spending bills that do not include a dime for new border security.  So, it is unclear how all of this shakes out.  And don't lose sight of the fact that on Friday, just four, five days from now, 800,000 federal workers are set to lose yet another paycheck, their second paycheck.  It would be an entire month's miss of work, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, so Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, is going to put up this proposal I'd like -- talk me through, because again, he would need 60 votes to move that, the Republicans now have 53 votes in the Senate.</p><p>BURMAN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are the prospects of that?  What kind of time frame are we looking at?</p><p>BURMAN:  The math here is simple, they're going to need seven Democrats and that is assuming that every single Republican goes with.  And keep in mind, Dagen, many Republicans think that or some at least, more conservative Republicans feel that what the president is put forward -- putting forward is amnesty or at least amounts to amnesty.</p><p>So, even if the Republicans in the Senate get all 53, they still need seven Democrats, even assume that that were to happen, then it goes to the House.  House Democrats there call that a nonstarter.  So again, where all of this goes from here?  The Republicans putting their plan, Democrats are putting their plan, and I'm not sure that much changed from what we saw over the weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for that reporting.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.</p><p>Joining us now, House Appropriations Committee member and he just became ranking member of the House Homeland Security subcommittee, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.  Congressman, great to see you.  Are you in favor what --</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R-TN), HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER, RANKING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY SUBCOMMITTEE:  Dagen, good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you in favor of what President Trump put before the American people, over the weekend?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I think it's another outstanding example of President Trump trying to do the right thing, let's face it.  He has tried and tried and tried, as have House Republicans since December to try to put together, something that will actually work.  And it's a little bit disingenuous for our friends on the other side of the isle to basically continue to say no, no, no, before they actually sit down and listen to proposals.</p><p>It's high time that we sit down together as Americans, not as Republicans and Democrats.  Not as Senators and House members but as elected representatives to serve the people and get government open.</p><p>But yes, I give the president high marks.  I thought his message the other day, was much more articulate and much better focused than it was a couple of weeks ago.  I think he was spot-on is reasonable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you would vote for this if it comes before the House?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I would study it.  I think it's a -- it's a package that I would be willing to look to see about a potential compromise to get the government open, get border security in place including a barrier and a wall.</p><p>I think Dagen, it's very important to realize that this is much more than just a wall.  We've got to look at border security, where there are areas, where a wall won't work, we've got to secure it that way.  But yes, I think we could sit down, and come up with something the American people want a reasonable compromise that will work for all.  I think it's time we get that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, with all due respect, are you having a problem saying I support short term protection for dreamers in this country?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Well, we have said long ago, even last year, when we offered this to the Democrats, that that is something that we'd be willing to look at.  I think we've got a problem with the DACA situation, we've got a problem with Comprehensive Immigration Reform in this country, it's possibly a start.</p><p>The DACA is a piece of a puzzle that includes border security.  That includes securing our southern border.  That includes making us safe in this country.</p><p>So, do I have a problem with that?  No, not at all.  I'm willing to sit down and talk, but border security is first and foremost.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, time is of the essence because you've got the government that shutdown for 31 days.  Federal workers have already missed one paycheck.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the knock-on effect dominos are falling across this country, whether people can easily see them or not in terms of government contractors, in terms of people who can't do business and can't get loans because the government shutdown, number one.</p><p>President Trump did talk about doing a bigger deal on immigration, but that is something to -- do something bigger later, and so, just -- to the nuts and bolts if you have people Republicans hemming and hawing about what the president put on the table over the weekend about three year protection for dreamers.  And other people who are at risk of deportation.  If Republicans hymn and haw about that, then this is a nonstarter, and that's coming from the Republican side not the Democrats.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  I think the vast majority of Republicans are willing to look at the big picture, at the full picture.  And we realize, we are in a position of divided government, let's face it.  Unfortunately, the Republicans control the Senate but we do not control the House.  Fortunately, we control the White House, but one-third of the government if you will, the House is controlled by very partisan liberal Democrats who don't see the world the way that we do.</p><p>So, we're going to have to sit down and say what do we need to do to get the government open, to get border security in place?  And yes, I've said long ago that we need to take a look at Comprehensive Immigration Reform in total, not just piecemeal.  So perhaps this is a catalyst and a very beneficial catalyst on the part of the president to get that discourse and debate started again on Comprehensive Immigration Reform.  And open the government and secure our border.</p><p>But let's face it, Republicans have been very steadfast and Democrats used to be steadfast about the fact that they wanted border security.  Border security includes a barrier, it includes a wall, but that's only one part of it, it's much more comprehensive than that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, thank you so much for being here.  I just look at it like this, President Trump says we'll do something bigger on immigration later and Ann Coulter hates what he proposed.  So again, that looks like something everybody should be able to get onboard with.  Congressman Fleischmann, thank you so much.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Straight ahead, China's economy under pressure, its economic growth hitting its slowest pace in nearly three decades.  We'll tell you if it could be beneficial to those trade talks we're having with China.</p><p>Plus, a Netflix reboot, the popular show, the streaming giant is bringing back since \"Stranger Things\" became such a hit, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Former Nissan Motors Chairman Carlos Ghosn making another request for bail.  Cheryl Casone has the details on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen.  This as Ghosn's detention stretches into its ninth week.  The Tokyo District Court is going to hear Ghosn's latest request in which he's offering to pay for ankle monitor and security guards as well as surrender his passport.  Ghosn still maintains that he's innocent.  He is accused of under reporting his compensation at Nissan.</p><p>Well, J.C. Penney is struggling to survive after a fellow department store chain Sears filed for bankruptcy.  The company named its new CEO late year but several senior executive slots remain empty.  So it's not clear whether J.C. Penney is going to stick with the plan to bring back appliances that are trying to take market share away from Sears.  The company has about $4 billion of debt we should add.  Shares of J.C. Penney are down 67 percent from a year ago.</p><p>All right.  Netflix is continuing its string reboots.  The latest is kind of cool.  They're excited about this.  They're going to bring back guys, Unsolved Mysteries.  Remember this from the 80s?  Netflix's the True Crime and Paranormal Activity show is going to follow the same original format only focused though on a single case.  The first season is going to start with 12 episodes.  Now, the executive producer Stranger Things is going to oversee this new production.</p><p>Netflix has not announced when the new Unsolved Mysteries will debut or who the host will be but Netflix, here's the stock, up 54 percent from a year ago.  I hope I'm not the only person that remembers Unsolved Mysteries, Dagen.  Please save me here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You remember --</p><p>FOWLER:  I remember Unsolved Mysteries.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Thank you, Richard Fowler.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, I am of age that I remember the original In Search Of, the syndicated show with the -- it was narrated Leonard Nimoy and it was super freaky.</p><p>FOWLER:  I just remember the show ending and will join us next week on another Unsolved Mystery.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But the way, I'm older than all -- as you Southerns would says all y'all.  And I watched the Twilight Zone, OK? So --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Twilight Zone is hard --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I'm throwing out out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Twilight Zone is hard to beat, you know, I'm not --</p><p>FOWLER:  That was freaky.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm too embarrassed to tell you what I watched over weekend.  The worst of the 70s movies.  I watch Urban Cowboy, I watch Mommy Dearest, it was -- it was --</p><p>FOWLER:  It was a 70s throwback weekend for you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  It's a little disco.  A little disco ball going too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  It was Urban Cowboy.  That's a --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No Saturday Night Fever, no Grease?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  No Grease.  It was all Urban Cowboy.  I'm more, you know, I'm more Charlie Daniels band than the Bee Gees.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  Plan B for Britain's exit from the European Union.  A new plan of action must brought to U.K. lawmakers by the end of the day.  Today, we break it down.  Plus heartbreak for the New Orleans Saints.  The Rams beat the team for a spot in the Super Bowl.  But fans are fighting mad.  The refs missed the call that cost the Saints the game.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The deadlock over Britain's exit from the E.U. stretches on.  Prime Minister Theresa May rolling out her revised plan day hoping to win over opposition within Parliament that shut down her original deal last week.  It has to be approved by the end of business today.  Joining us now, British foreign -- former International Development Secretary Priti Patel.  Great of you to be here.</p><p>PRITI PATEL, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is the outlook for this -- her revised plan?</p><p>PATEL:  Well, we haven't heard her revised plan just yet.  She will be speaking House of Commons, the building behind me at 3:30 GMT later today.  And we expect her to outline how is she going to tackle the major stumbling block which of course this backstop, this backstop to her withdrawal agreement.  Is she going to go to Brussels and is she ask for negotiations where we can actually change the backstop.</p><p>And if she can achieve that then actually Parliament and my colleagues, myself will come out and absolutely give support to that proposition.  But until the backstop is ditched or is changed that we get legal assurances around it nothing would have changed.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Priti, Mitch Roschelle.  Is it all about the backstop because I'm looking at the votes and there were from -- Theresa May's party, 196 for 118 against.  So it doesn't seem like there is a lot of support from within her own party.  Are there she's beyond the backstop or is it really all hinging around the backstop?</p><p>PATEL:  Well, we should remember that the backstop is part of a legal treaty and, you know, once any government signs a legal treaty it becomes law.  And so the backstop essential to that treaty and we want the treaty to be reopened to address the backstop but there are couple of other issues.  I mean, you know, I voted to leave the European Union, as if the majority of the British public, 17.4 million people voted to leave.</p><p>So they don't want us to be taken our laws from the European Court of Justice which is also in that treaty.  So fundamentally, the Prime Minister does needs to go to Brussels.  She's going to have to be very robust, you know, we've got to stop being a rule taker from the European Union, we want to set our own rules just like a lot of other countries around the world do and that's what needs to changed.</p><p>BOLTON:  Quick follow though because Brussels has made it really clear, they're finished, they're finished talking.  What's on the table is on the table.  So do you -- it sounds like you think there could be wiggle room?</p><p>PATEL:  Well, I think there has to be and I think this -- we've seen today the polish foreign minister has also basically suggested that this would be the right course of action to engage, and we very candid.  You know, I don't think we've had a proper negotiations from the United Kingdom perspective.  It's has been a process and that process from my point of view has been very one way.  I've been vocal about that.</p><p>BOLTON:  The government should have put more skin in the game, be more robust basically with European Commission.  And now is the time to do that.  The clock is ticking.  And the European Commission and E.U. member states have a lot to lose out, you know, if they don't get an agreement.  So it's mutually beneficial to use diplomatic language, it's mutually beneficial for them to come to an accommodation and for us to come to the right kind of accommodation too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that Theresa May has between vigorous enough in that line of argument that seems to be the problem.</p><p>PATEL:  Well she hasn't, I mean, I have seen her many times up made this point to her, I've made it publicly as well.  She hasn't.  I think she's led a process and not a negotiation.  So, you know, in this process, European Commission still say to us publicly, you need to tell us what you want.  But we know what we want and we know what we need right now if we're going to get an agreement to leave on March 29.</p><p>And that's basically what she now needs to take to the European Commission.  And I think actually she is going to have to raise all elements now and be really quite robust, you know, go back and tell them.  This is what my House of Commons have said, this is what British public voted for.  We need to come to that accommodation and to make sure that she can deliver the Brexit that she said she would deliver for the British public.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Priti Patel, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>PATEL:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Please come back because this is not ending, not today.  Coming up.  A warning for China's economy growth hits its slowest pace since 1990.  Markets might be closed but Fox Business is open.  We break it down for you next.  And then we've got so much more to cover.  Look at that.  For the Rams, the Patriots are going to the Super Bowl.  Should have been the Saints?  Yes.  More ahead.</p><p>PRAKASH AMRITRAJ, TENNIS CHANNEL COURT REPORTER:  I'm back for another Tennis Channel Court Report.  For Fox Business, I'm Prakash Armitraj.  May 8 at the Australian Opens, a major upset on the men's side as Milos Raonic took out the number four seed Sascha Zverev to reach the elite 8.  The Canadian took full advantage of a poor performance from the German who hit 23 unforced errors compared to 45 winners for Raonic.  It closed the out straight sets win on his fourth match point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILOS RAONIC, CANADIAN TENNIS PLAYER:  I probably would have looked after that match and maybe wished I did some things differently but I just kept thinking forward and focusing on my serve and I was getting out back behind a little bit but I flew if I could sort of even things out I could I get myself a chance with my serve.  So I just tried to stay composed, things were going well, extremely well for me today and finished off that way as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARMRITRAJ:  And don't forget, Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Australia Open continues Monday at 6:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Prakash Amritraj.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, January 21st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Shutdown day 31, the showdown continues.  President Trump hitting back at Democrats after they rejected a compromise idea that he announced over the weekend, that potentially could end the shutdown.  Meantime, U.S. Markets are closed today, as we honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board, although markets will open less than an hour from now, 105-point loss on the Dow Futures.  The markets are open in Europe, and we have losses in France and Germany, slight gains still on the FTSE 100 in England.  Asian markets ending higher overnight; gains in Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai and South Korea despite the news that China's economy grew at the slowest pace since 1990 last year.  But again, maybe hopes, maybe they already knew about the slowdown, number one; and number two maybe hopes of a trade deal on the rise with the United States.</p><p>Then, a new hat thrown in the ring: Democratic California Senator Kamala Harris announcing that she is running for president in 2020.  We have the latest.  Honoring a legend on this special day, presidential hopefuls are set to honor Dr. King on the anniversary of his birth and we look back, at what he accomplished for this country.  What still needs to be done?</p><p>Controversy on the gridiron.  The Rams beating the Saints to grab a spot in the Super Bowl, but fans are hot angry, saying that the refs missed a call that caused the Saints a game.  An important game, that would have sent them to the Super Bowl.  They you go, missed call.</p><p>To our top story this half hour.  However, markets are closed, but we are open for business.  Futures are trading, although the markets will not open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  And we've had some pressure across the board.  Joining us now, Bulltick Capital Markets Head of Global Research Kathryn Rooney Vera.  Kathryn, thank you for taking the time to come on this morning.  It's been a great run for the markets heading into the new year after what was a really truly awful fourth quarter, can this continue given all the headwinds whether it's the trade deal and the government shutdown.</p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS:  Well, Dagen, you're right.  And the fourth quarter was a great time to accumulate positions, and that's what I've been recommending to my institutional and retail clients is precisely that: go along emerging markets, go along the U.S. S&amp;P.  I think that, right now, what we're pricing in the market in the fourth quarter, Dagen, was pricing in, which was effectively on the (INAUDIBLE) for the markets because of trade war.  It will turn out to have proven to be and opportune moment to go along in market where we have economic strength regardless of the narrative that we're hearing in every, in every facet of the media.  It seems to me that recession is imminent.  Recession is not imminent.  And I do think we're going to get some form of trade deal that's going to send the markets higher.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Hey, Kathryn, good morning, it's Mitch.  The thing that concerns me about emerging markets is, not all emerging markets are the same.  So, when you say, go long emerging markets are there, pockets that are less risky than others right now?</p><p>VERA:  Yes, there's the -- MSCI emerging markets, which is the -- basically the index which looks at a broad state of E.M.  So, it's China, it's India and Brazil, all of these countries I think have been, disproportionately -- well, some more than others, you're right, but Brazil, for example has been beating up severely; it was a great moment to go along in the fourth quarter while already up double digits from October of last year.  So, certainly, some countries are more beaten up than others but I will contend China proves to be -- I think will prove to be an interesting and appealing place to do business, because of the trade fears.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Kathryn, Deirdre here, I just -- the IMF just publishing this now; they're actually cutting their global growth forecast.  And then, particularly in China, actually projecting it's going to be weaker than even the print that we got this morning.  So, they're saying, in 2019, 6.6 percent; 2026, 0.6 percent, so do you feel like China is going to inject mores stimulus, is that why you're a little bit more bullish.</p><p>VERA:  Yes.  Well, China has a very interesting story because they have the social contract.  And it being a communist country, while people are still repressed with regard to their ability to access certain Internet pages or anything like that.  The restrictive nature living in the country requires that they have to be given something in turn, right?  So, if the unemployment rate is low, things are OK.  If unemployment starts to take up, or economic slowdown is more aggressive than it was otherwise expected, then, the government starts to get worried.  So, that's where we are right now.  I do expect this -- I think it comes first quarter.  I would even think that monetary is in the cards as well.</p><p>And remember, China has been slowing for decades.  China has been slowing for some time, and it's actually an orderly slowdown in the sense of they've been trying to become a global economic geopolitical superpower, which changing their economic fundamentals from one based on -- you know, we all talked about the ghost towns or the roads to nowhere.  So, one based on state government spending to one based on domestic demands.  So, that's been a coordinated effort.  Now, I think that the stars are aligned, Deirdre, and I would say that incentives are aligned both for the Chinese and for the United States to come to an agreement -- albeit small with regard to trade.</p><p>FOWLER:  So, talking about agreement, I mean, what elements of that agreement -- what are you guys looking for on the market to say this is a good agreement, this is a green light for us to put more capital in.  What do you want these trade negotiators to agree on that would get the market excited?</p><p>VERA:  Well, I think, Richard the joint ventures, allowing joint ventures between U.S. companies and Chinese companies in China would be very clutched.  We've already seen some concessions from the Chinese which are, I think are a good will on the negotiating table; to say, OK, we're actually in this to do something.  Of course, the question that I always get is execution risk, but I do think that, again, the incentives are aligned for the Chinese to give something to come to agreement with U.S., so that the deceleration that was already in the cards is not aggravated further.</p><p>So, what I'm look for is -- we've already seen the reopening of imports to U.S. cars, decreasing the tariffs from 40 to 15 is excellent news; as well, I would like to see a real crackdown on I.P. theft.  This is something that we've been seeing, as you would know from Bill Clinton days, right?  The U.S. is really complaining about the I.P. theft -- and we've seen some concrete punitive measures that the Chinese have put forth on their own companies that engage in this type of theft.</p><p>FOWLER:  I think intellectual property is going to be the biggest part these -- that's the big elephant in the room.  If we could get intellectual property taken care of, the rest of the stuffs becomes easy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>VERA:  I would agree with that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Kathryn, that would get all investors excited.  Just really quickly, what do you underweight here in terms of sectors or asset classes?</p><p>VERA:  Look, I think, I think -- Dagen, I think Europe is really not the place to be.  I like Europe last year because of valuations, purely because of valuations.  Because the U.S. looked very rich and Euro looked very cheap.  Europe hasn't done their homework.  We don't have any structural reform; whereas with their competitors, in terms of market competitors, we have the U.S., tax reform deregulation; Japan, we have corporate board governments reform and increase of women in the labor force, which desperately need.  So, when an investor is looking at where to put money and develop markets, they shouldn't look at Europe, because valuations are no longer attractive.  U.S. valuations look far more attractive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Eurozone's economy, broadly speaking, is slowing to the point that the European Central Bank -- short term interest rates are negative and they were trying to raise them to get them back to normal.  And now, people over there are talking about, they're going to keep the deposit rate at the current level, until at least end of 2020, that you're going to have negative rates until 2020, which is -- again, almost unfathomable.  Exactly.  Kathryn Rooney Vera, great --</p><p>VERA:  But Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Finish your thought, Kathryn, go ahead.</p><p>VERA:  Well, Dagen, I was just going to say, that's an opportunity, I think, that should be of interest for investors over the course of the next year.  Let's look at European banks, because once, Dagen, they lift that punitive, it's a tax.  It's a tax on banks.  So, once they lift that eventually, which they will do, then you're going to see banks fly in Europe.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I might be collecting Social Security and on Medicare by the time that happens --</p><p>VERA:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not that far off, but it's far enough.  Thank you so much, Kathryn Rooney Vera.  Take care.</p><p>VERA:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, campaign kickoff.  Democratic Senator Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy for the president of the United States, this morning.  The outlook for 2020, next.  Plus, no call controversy.  The Rams advancing to the Super Bowl after a big win over the New Orleans Saints but that one controversial play, sparking outrage.  The details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Remembering an icon.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., markets are closed today to honor his legacy, celebrate his birthday, and at least six 2020 presidential hopefuls from the Democratic Party are honoring him with events today.  Joining me now is Strategic Consulting Founder and Fox News Contributor Gianno Caldwell.  And Gianno, this morning, we just found out that she is definitely running, Democratic California Senator Kamala Harris.  She announced this morning on Martin Luther King Day, that she is running for president in 2020.  What do you make of the field so far?</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me, this morning, it's certainly glad to celebrate MLK Day.  Martin Luther King obviously was a giant and who sacrificed his own life for the benefit of us all.  So, when I saw the ad from Kamala Harris, there was two things that stuck out, and they were some of her first words.  Justice and decency, to me, sound like it was a very intentional play on President Trump, and what her campaign may be about.  Certainly, showing what she believed that he might be dividing America and perhaps not being a decent President, and I think that will be a fairly problematic in a way that I think a lot of these candidates have been beginning to make things more about Trump versus their vision for America, and I think that's a failed strategy.  The candidates whether they're running for president or anything else, have levied and has been losing strategies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they have to -- Richard, they have to show during this primary process and during this nominating process that they can beat President Trump, and that's something I mentioned earlier.  It's not just about, left, left, left policy, it's about can you actually take on President Trump in general.</p><p>FOWLER:  And I think that's what's going to be the bellwether for who ends up at the top of this field, who's at the bottom of this field is how they show the Democratic Party and Democratic Party faithfuls that they are the candidate to beat Donald Trump. And I have a question for Gianno, as we were talking about during the break.  So, most of the vice -- most of the presidential on the Democratic side are all-out doing an MLK commemoration today.  And I always think it's a missed opportunity for the White House, both the President and Vice President to not do MLK events.  It's an opportunity to expand his base, speak to the community, speak to African-American -- speak to Americans broadly.  Why is it that this White House chooses not to do something on MLK Day, or the President doesn't do anything publicly?</p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, Richard, I'm not familiar what his calendar looks like today.  I would say it would be -- it would certainly be a missed opportunity if the President does not address the nation in some way form or fashion with regards to MLK, and I would find it hard to believe that he would not certainly considering the fact that MLK was a conservative.  This was an individual who believed in conservative Christian values, one of which I think a lot of Americans, especially people within President Trump's base celebrates.  So, with that being the case, although his calendar may be empty, that certainly doesn't mean that he won't do anything in response in respect to a great leader like Dr. Martin Luther King.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I just want to point out, I would say one of the kind of notable achievements in the last year on both sides of the aisle is the criminal justice reform.</p><p>FOWLER:  Justice reform, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Gianno, I know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, you were an incredible advocate for that.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And everybody came together and made it happen.  And I think that's something that needs to be celebrated today.</p><p>FOWLER:  I think that's absolutely right, Dagen.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think -- I think that's right --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOWLER:  Go ahead, Gianno.</p><p>CALDWELL:  That's certainly -- that's certainly is, I think, a great achievement, and we got to also recognize the fact that it was a bipartisan effort, but this is something that did originate from the White House.  We can talk about the opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott.  There's certainly been an interest in terms of rebuilding communities of color, and I'm really, really appreciative of that.  And I hope to see something like that continue, and I think that's something in which President Trump is watching, that's something that he can lay out and say, hey, I was so happy to be a part of these many efforts that continues the legacy of MLK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I hope today, we remember what unites us, not what divides us, whether it's faith in God and country.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Absolutely.  We need more of that, period.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you -- amen to that, Gianno.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you, sir.  Gianno Caldwell.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Super Bowl bound, the Rams headed to the NFL Championship after beating the New Orleans Saints in overtime, but no call?  No call.  The Rams win, the Saints will be at home, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Super Bowl LIII all set, but there is controversy.  Jared Max has the details.  Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  It's going to be the Patriots against the Rams in Super Bowl LIII, but many think it should be the Patriots against the Saints.  The NFC Championship yesterday, late in the fourth quarter, the Saints who led the Rams 13-0, were tied 20-20 with just over two minutes to go, and there could not have been a more blatant pass interference infraction, but Nickell Robey-Coleman avoids the call somehow.  The NFL admits the refs blew it.  Pass interference and a helmet-to-helmet contact.  So, the Saints could have run out the clock to set up a game-winning score, but the Rams forced overtime in a field to go with 15 seconds left.  In overtime, the Saints get the ball first, but Drew Brees gets intercepted by John Johnson III, and that would set up the Rams' Greg Zuerlein to kick a 57-yard field goal.  That kicks the Rams into the Super Bowl.</p><p>The first time that both conference championship games went to overtime.  38 points in the final quarter between the Pats and the Chiefs.  Conference title game record Rex Burkhead gives the pass to late lead but the Chiefs were forced overtime with a field goal, with eight seconds to go, great work from Patrick Mahomes to put the Chiefs in position, but then in overtime, the Patriots marched down the field, Rex Burkhead wins it.  Patriots 37-31.  Super Bowl LIII, same as Super Bowl 36.  New England opened as a one-point underdog, and now the Patriots are favored to win by 1-1/2, February 3rd less than two weeks away, Dagen.  We have a great matchup.  This is the ninth time Brady and Belichick go to the Super Bowl together.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If it was the Cowboys against the Patriots, I'd root for the Cowboys.  That says it all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAX:  The Patriots are public enemy number one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I would not put -- I would never bet -- I've never put money on the Patriots losing, I'll say that.  Jared, it was a heartbreaker for Saints' fans.  Thank you so much, Jared Max.  Catch Jared's Sports Reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7, Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Coming up, that Kentucky high school student speaking out after being accused of mocking a Native American protester in a viral video.  Well, there was a video that lasted two hours, but it appears that nobody on social media bothered to get to the bottom of the story until it was too late.  That straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trying to tell the whole story behind a story -- something that dominated social media over the weekend.  A video showing an alleged confrontation between a high school student and students, and Native Americans in Washington, D.C. sparked internet outrage, but the clip that went viral did not give the full picture of what happened.  Mainstream media from Hollywood Reporter, CNN, VOX seized on the students with their Make America Great Again hats vilifying them.  People online lost their minds.  Kentucky Congressman John Yarmuth called for a complete shutdown of teenagers wearing MAGA hats.</p><p>But now the teen in the video, Nick Sandman, is speaking out.  In a statement, the Kentucky High School student says this, \"I am being called every name in the book including a racist, and I will not stand for this mob-like character assassination of my family's name.  I am mortified that so many people have come to believe something that did not happen, that students from my school were chanting or acting in a racist fashion toward African-Americans or Native Americans.  I did not do that, do not have hateful feelings in my heart, and did not witness any of my classmates doing that.\"</p><p>Richard, I'll just point to a photo and a short video clip never tell the whole story.  And there's two hours, roughly two hours of video of what was developing of all places.  I think this was at the Lincoln Memorial.  And -- but there was a -- if you look at largely the facts in the longer video, that this massive -- there was a massive rush to judgment about what really happened.</p><p>FOWLER:  Oh, yes, I think you have to see the whole video in its entirety, but what I -- what I think we were missing here is a character lesson that I think we could all learn.  I mean, I want to say where was the chaperon to tell these kids, hey, listen, this is not what you do.  And I think that's what's missing here, and it's sort of sad that now we hear -- we sit discussing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we are here to say to people online: get the whole story --</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2169367457</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V84-V5K1-DY0W-4502-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I', Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Monday, January 21st, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shutdown showdown day 31. President Trump making an offer to end the government shutdown, but the Democrats showed no signs of compromise yet. We look at what's on the table straight ahead. Economic slowdown in China. New numbers out show that growth in China came in at its slowest pace last year since 1990. What this means for our markets, the global economy and President Trump's trade negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Super Bowl LIII set. The Patriots, yes, heading back to the big game for third straight year, but it was a controversial call. In the Saints- Rams game that has everyone talking this morning, unfair say those Saints fans. The highlights later this hour. Plus catch of the day, a bald eagle goes viral after it was caught on camera stealing a fisherman's fresh catch. We will show you that to you over and over and over again right now. MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.</p><p>U.S. markets might be closed for the holiday today and we celebrate today the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but we are open for business here at the FOX Business Network. Let's take a look at how the futures are faring this morning. We have a 99-point loss on the features. The global market action will really tell you what's afoot here. In Europe, we have some mixed markets. Losses in France and Germany, and in Asia overnight, we take a look at gains across the board there. Despite this news out of China that the economy last year grew at the slowest pace since 1990, more on that straight ahead.</p><p>Be sure to join us tomorrow. By the way, we kickoff live coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Maria Bartiromo will be back one-on-one with Verizon's CEO, Blackstone's CEO Stephen Schwarzman, IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty, Microsoft's President Brad Smith, SAP's CEO Bill McDermott, a favorite of this program, and Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan. That bank out with some great numbers last week. You don't want to miss any of Maria's coverage from Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>Meantime, the government shutdown enters day 31. Democrats rejecting President Trump's bid to reopen the government that offered DACA protections in exchange to fund the border wall. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle weighing in yesterday with Maria Bartiromo on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Tell me you're thinking in terms of what your colleagues will push back on.</p><p>SEN. JOHN HOEVEN (R-ND), SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE: Well, that's it. This is just basic common sense. First, it's just part of national security. Second, they voted for it before we have existing border wall, border fence, whatever you want to call it, the fund -- Democrats have funded it for previous Presidents, including President Obama, there -- there's no reason to turn this down, particularly now when we're reaching out and compromising on things that they want.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: I don't know any Democrat that doesn't care about keeping nation safe. We do need --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No.</p><p>DINGELL: -- to have border security. And we need to talk about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, let me -- let me stop you there --</p><p>DINGELL: It's not just the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you say that you don't know any Democrats who don't want border security and yet none of them voted for Kate's law, none of them voted to end sanctuary city status. None of them voted for the DACA plan that the President put on the table. So, can you really say that, that they're for border security when they haven't voted for any of the above?</p><p>DINGELL: You know, yes, I can say that. And I'm going to talk about how we need to support actual policy that works.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This as Senate Majority Mitch McConnell reportedly prepares to call a vote on the President's offer to protect Dreamers combining it with legislation pass by House Democrats to fund government agencies through the fiscal year. Here with me now, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and FOX News contributor, Richard Fowler. Welcome, gentlemen. You'll be with me all three hours, so buckle up.</p><p>Deirdre's coming up in a minute, but speaking of buckling up, you are all about business. Is there pressure on the Republicans on President Trump to do something because of the impact on the economy, more and more that we're seeing?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: I think, Dagen, every single day is going to get more and more pressure. It went from being an inconvenience where school lunches are impacted and it becomes annoying to something where it's going to be an impact on the economy. It's 800,000 people, their families, they're spending their decisions slowly but surely, it's gone start to slow down (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is payments to contractors, the employees who work for contractors, it is SBA loans, small business loans to getting approved and --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The food and beverage industry is impact. It's -- the knock on effect goes on and on and on and I think it's going to start to drag on fourth quarter GDP on, no question about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: (INAUDIBLE) GDP.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, is there room for compromise in terms of the -- because the Democrat's response from Nancy Pelosi was we're -- no. To the -- and we should point out this is protection for Dreamers, DACA resident for three years. So, it's temporary protection for them, and other individuals, about 300,000 individuals who were facing deportation.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think there's actually is room for a deal. I think what Democrats -- I mean I think the big lynchpin for Democrats is let's reopen the government first and let's not use the 800,000 workers as a bargaining chip and then actually let's sit down and come to the table and figure out how we do reel last the immigration reform, not short-term fixes, not a one-term wall allocation, but how do we look at this system and work -- and make sure it works perfectly for right now?</p><p>And I think that's where Democrats are, but what we're saying -- that the Democrats are saying very clearly the President is, let's not keep the government shutdown while we negotiate immigration. There are two different things, reopen negotiate, take those 800,000 people back to work meanwhile that's happening we will -- we can negotiation and we can debate. And we can have a debate about ideals of how we fix our broken immigration system.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The reason -- one of the reasons and you saw it on the display, one of the more -- the recent White House meeting. President Trump being dug in on this in terms of the order rather than we reopen the government and we can debate and then we talk of -- then we talk about funding the wall, is what you're talking about, is because President Trump looked at Nancy Pelosi and said a month from now, if we reopen the government, will you fund my wall? And she said no.</p><p>FOWLER: Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so that's where we are.</p><p>FOWLER: No, I get that. I think that one of the reasons for that and I think the reason why Speaker Pelosi, as well as Leader Schumer, and some Republicans are some House Republicans who've defected from the President. I think the reason being is that there's larger problems in our Southern Border. If you look at the illegal immigration problem in this country, every (INAUDIBLE) will you our Southern Border isn't the problem, our problem is Visa overstays.</p><p>When we people come to our airports, they come to our seaports, they -- they're on tourist visa, there's -- they're on student visa, and they chose to -- they choose to stay in the United States. You could build a 80-foot wall, Dagen, and you're still going to have visa overstays.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I think that the flip side of this -- and this in part when Bret Baier interviewed Steny Hoyer last week, he asked the Majority Leader in the House, he said, \"OK, well then do you want to get rid of the wall that exists now? If you don't believe in funding additional wall, do you want to take down what's there now?\" And he went, \"No.\" But -- I paraphrased, but again that's where we are. Why not let's do all of it? And we can't even get something -- again, $5.7 billion is not a small amount of money, but in the size of our multitrillion-dollar economy, it is a small amount of money.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It seems to be so obvious that there are compromises here, but both sides are just so dug in that it looks like the impasse goes on indefinitely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, flyers are going to get more and more angry because I know that the TSA, the unscheduled absence rate, hit eight percent Saturday, up from seven percent on Friday, and it was up from three percent a year earlier. So, there are the -- once it rally -- it -- average everyday Americans start to feel this, look out in Washington.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You want to hear outrage? Wait until I'm impacted by this. Then we can hear clear outrage.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mr. Calm, Cool, and Collected, both of you quite frankly.</p><p>FOWLER: No, and I mean I think beyond that, I think the other thing you have to worry about is this is the last payment. I think this week's is last payment for food stamps (INAUDIBLE) program, so starting next week, folks are going to start going hungry and that's the facts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't you hate all politicians? I --</p><p>FOWLER: Happy Martin Luther King Day, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. We are going to talk about some uplift -- we're going to talk about the good things going on in this country. I promise.</p><p>China's economic growth is the slowest that it's been since 1990 according to the Wall Street Journal. Deirdre Bolton, what is your take on this?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. Dagen, there's a few takes, right? There's two main reasons. So you have the trade war with the U.S. that is certainly hurting China, and then you have China's own President, Xi Jinping, about three years ago really trying to curb borrowings. This is fact that -- there he is there. Basically just putting a cap on what businesses can borrow, on what government has borrowed, and so essentially slow down the growth rate all by himself.</p><p>Now UBS saying watch for China to increase stimulus measure as we go forward. You're looking at that graph right now. So, we're giving you this perspective back from 2009 to present day. And as you said, Dagen, I mean slowest rate in nearly three decades. The other thing I wanted to point out, Chinese jobless rates, 4.9 percent last month. And while that is mostly expected as far as what strategies we're think, it is certainly representative of the slowdown.</p><p>So, one thing ahead to come, just watch for stimulus. UBS out with a big report, big note on that this morning saying China is going to do everything it can to gin up again especially as the trade war with the U.S. continues, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the big question is -- and I know Mitch can talk about this as the discussion moves on, Deirdre, is that can we even believe these numbers? And what is going to be China's reaction to this? Because in the past, it was they're trying to lower the debt levels in the nation. And so it will be interesting to see how they try and prop up their economy there.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean I think we're always concerned, right, about the sort of how we can those statistics and whether or not they're a hundred percent on, but the slowing theme seems to be confirmed by many sources, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Chinese markets were higher overnight despite the news, so, again, maybe their reaction is, \"Tell us something we don't know.\" Thank you, Deirdre. We'll see you shortly.</p><p>Meantime, moving on to this story, an Alabama police officer shot and killed. Cheryl Casone has the details. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Dagen. Officer Sean Tuder was fatally shot yesterday afternoon in Mobile, Alabama. He is the second officer in Alabama to lose his life in the line of duty just this month. Police say a 19-year-old suspect was arrested. Officer Tuder joined the Mobile Police Department back in 2016. He was named Officer of the Month in August of 2017. His death brings the total number of officers shot and killed in the U.S. now to four so far this year.</p><p>Well, another headline this morning, we're watching Former Nissan Motors Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has made another request for bail as his detention stretches into its ninth week. The Tokyo District Court is going to hear Ghosn's later request, in which he's offering to pay for an ankle monitor and security guards, as well as surrender his passport. Ghosn still maintains that he is innocent as he's accused of underreporting his compensation at Nissan. The court rejected Ghosn's initial bail request last week,</p><p>Well, here we go again, later today, British Prime Minister Theresa May going to present her plan B for the U.K. to exit the European Union as it's going to look like plan A is the question. Just last week, Parliament (INAUDIBLE) rejected her initial deal and reports say that May has been holding talks with the opposition parties because of a split in her own conservative party. Remember, 118 in her own party voted against her last week.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles appears to be keeping the Irish and the Northern Ireland border open if the U.K. and E.U fail to strike to a deal. So Ireland's at play here. The deadline to leave the E.U, March 29th, Dagen. Just kind of uphill battle right now that she is fighting and Brussels is kind of not interested in talking it seems. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl, for that --</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- story -- all those stories. Coming up, heartbreak for the New Orleans Saints, the Rams beating them for a spot in the Super Bowl, but one controversial no call getting all the attention this morning. Plus caught on camera, watch as this brazen bald eagle snatches a fisherman's bounty right from under his nose.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New fallout for Facebook. The Washington Post reporting the social media giant could face a record-setting fine over its data privacy scandal. The Federal Trade Commission's highest penalty on record has against Google for 22 and a half million dollars. What's your reaction to this? When I see an M instead of a B, I'm like, \"Heh.\"</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Yes. The legal fees that they'll spend could ellipse that. I think the -- there's a cultural shift going on with this company because younger folks don't use it. They certainly use Instagram --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is owned by Facebook.</p><p>FOWLER: Which is owned by Facebook.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Which is owned by Facebook, right? I'm just -- but that's a separate story, but Facebook really is for sort of the baby boomers and I don't think that there's a complete understanding what really goes on there. So, I think as more and more user -- but you're starting to see people aren't checking as much, 26 percent deleted the app. So, there's something going on there. And I -- and I that it's going to impact that company if they don't get ahead of this the right way.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I mean Sheryl Sandberg, right, the COO, making this kind of speech in Munich, which was very much (INAUDIBLE) I mean if you heard it, it sort of seems like OK this is what I need to say to keep the regulators in Europe at bay and now breathing down our neck as they are. But to your point, I actually think there is an increased likelihood that the U.S. is going to go the way of that GDPR and really start to enforce some rules against big tech. I'm with you, though, as far ask, like, the millions that doesn't really even --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: That's like Facebook's coffee budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It -- what were you going to say?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But I don't -- but I don't know who regulates it. I mean what I can imagine is Congress decides to do something and we can't even figure out for years what agency is going to be responsible for it. Is it the telecom industry? Is it the Federal Trade Commission? I don't know who's responsible for regulating.</p><p>FOWLER: I think -- Mitch, I think you bring up a good point. I think beyond that, I think even scarier is the idea that congress is going to try to regulate Facebook when you saw at the Zuckerberg hearing not too long ago they were asking questions about, like, \"So when you run banner ads on WhatsApp,\" and I'm like there's no banner ads on WhatsApp. It's encrypted. But I digress.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Almost as good as the Google questions about the iPhone and the guy was like --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Exactly. We don't --</p><p>BOLTON: We're -- that's actually not my company. Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: We don't take another company.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: But I think you're also right. I mean the point where, as the millennial on the panel, the point where my mom got on Facebook is the point where I started to sort of migrate off the platform.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: And I think for a lot of people --</p><p>BOLTON: So what do you use? Snap?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Or your grand -- or you grandmother's on it.</p><p>FOWLER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. What do you use, Snap?</p><p>FOWLER: Instagram.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>FOWLER: Instagram, Twit -- more so Instagram than anything.</p><p>BOLTON: But they're still getting your data then.</p><p>FOWLER: Yes. So yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Facebook.</p><p>FOWLER: So Facebook is still getting my data regardless. It's going through one of their other --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: -- companies. But I do think that -- when it comes to -- we've got to figure this out. We've got to figure out pretty quickly on how we regulate these tech companies. One, who's going to write the regs, and two, where are the regs going to go? Which agency will be responsible for these regulations, because it's clear that regulations are going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I've said this literally for years --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- on (INAUDIBLE) that if they don't do something to rein in their nefarious behavior, I'll use that term, then they're asking for the asking for the government to come in. This is well before the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>BOLTON: And the potential top cop has made --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: -- recent comments, right? We spoke about that last week, about saying -- Barr saying, \"OK, yes, I am going to look into privacy, data security, and how these companies function.\"</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: The big -- the biggest way that -- there a few -- a couple of things that Washington can do. And this was -- this was when they rolled out Facebook Live, the video -- the live video streaming service.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And people were killing other people on it and committing murders and suicides and their reaction was we --</p><p>BOLTON: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oops -- no, oops, it was oops we didn't think about that before we rolled out the -- rolled out that platform. But there are two things that I think Washington can do. One, there are liability projections for these social media companies for user-generated content because they're not treated like media companies. Washington can revisit that. And then also any other acquisitions these companies make. They can put the --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I (INAUDIBLE) and I also think that if you notice there's two different strategies from the tech company -- so Google, when they went down the Capitol Hill, they sort of said, \"Yes, regulations are good and we'll work with you on them, which is very much a different strategy in the strategy. \"I can't find the light switch.\"</p><p>BOLTON: I think people -- actually lobbying-wise, they spend the most time --</p><p>FOWLER: Absolutely.</p><p>BOLTON: -- and the most money in D.C. They have been there for years. I mean even when Eric Schmidt, it was pretty much base down there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they had to scramble after President Trump was elected to try and hire somebody who actually could speak Republican, I guess.</p><p>BOLTON: They had -- that they kind of -- but their infrastructure is there --</p><p>FOWLER: They have a huge --</p><p>BOLTON: -- I feel like more than any other big tech.</p><p>FOWLER: They have a big infrastructure and they have a different strategy. I mean the strategy -- when Sandeep went down there, he was talking about, yes, we're open to regulation. Here's what we think regulation could look like. Whereas on Facebook did none of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but Google's -- we should say Google's CEO showed up a lot later, but I basically --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And then -- and after Monday, had like the blank chair --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, the -- but the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is the Google -- right. So he was reticent to show up in front of those lawmakers, real quick note.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yesterday's proven that when your industry's going to get regulated, get ahead of it --</p><p>FOWLER: yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: -- and help the regulators figure out. Don't fight with them.</p><p>FOWLER: Yes. And I think that's the -- that's the prevailing that Google has over Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Or a lot of the other companies, too. They've got --</p><p>BOLTON: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- they've got problems. Like look at Twitter. What happened to -- on Twitter over the weekend, we'll talk about that later in the show.</p><p>BOLTO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, major hurdles for millennials in the housing market, what the generation is facing is it tries to enter the home buying game, and shaking up the beard game, the change Bud Light is making to its cold brew and it's big impact on the craft beer industry. That's coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're taking a look at some of the big headlines across America this morning. The Denver Post writing about how millennials are facing major hurdles to becoming homebuyers. The article points that millennials are expected to make out. Forty-five percent of the people taking out mortgages this year. But according to the article, some of the challenges that that group of young people is facing, high student loan debt and slow wage growth, something that the Federal Reserve published a paper on.</p><p>Meanwhile the Boston Globe has an article on how the V.C. forecast includes hopes for A.I. in Africa and worries about politicians. A dozen local venture capitalist speaking out on key developments that they're watching among them. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology to virtual goods like online avatars.</p><p>Finally, we look at the Seattle Times that asked, \"Forget to take your medication? A new digital pill will alert you, and your doctor.\" A physician is prescribing pills with a mini-sensor inside. The sensor travels the body, sending data to a mobile app including your heart rate, and whether the pill was even taken. The pill has raised privacy concerns with critics wondering if the sensors can be hacked. Richard Fowler, you're a millennial. But --</p><p>FOWLER: Oh, Lord.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think this might even be enough in terms of technology use.</p><p>FOWLER: That might be like the mark of the beast or something. That's a scary --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, dystopian (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FOWLER: That's a scary idea that there's a pill that my doctor's tracking what I'm do -- no. I'm get -- no.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Were you -- were -- I want to -- but you were saying that Facebook's facial recognition technology is super freaky.</p><p>FOWLER: Yes, that already -- yes. So the Facebook facial recognition already creeps me out. The idea of popping a pill and then the doctor can, like, track my heart rate, no, that's a little bit -- little bit too much privacy that I'm giving up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.</p><p>FOWLER: But I do want to buy a home one day, so hey.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: If we merge those two stories, what about medical data privacy? So all of this is out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And medical -- that people's medical data being hacked is a huge issue. And all of a sudden, we've got social media involved with what -- information about what pills we take, that scares me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can say that the --</p><p>FOWLER: I am also.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- protections for medical data in this country, if you've ever (INAUDIBLE) into a hospital's website or your doctor's network website, it is not what it should be in terms of the two-factor authentication.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the things that are in place that other social media companies have. And by the way, I just want to add, almost every piece of information that Facebook has about me is completely made up. I did that from the get-go because I -- because I'm --</p><p>BOLTON: It's a good experiment --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- like, you know what, if you're going to make money off of me, you can make money off my best self.</p><p>FOWLER: Listen --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which is just completely fabricated.</p><p>FOWLER: I was on Facebook when you had to have a college email address to be on it. Now, everyone's on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, fewer today than even three months ago.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I mean beyond that -- but they stopped checking their birthday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>FOWLER: (INAUDIBLE) remembered it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why -- so that's why everybody forgot my birthday. I'm just kidding.</p><p>FOWLER: I didn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mine's fake, so I was not born in 1987, which we all know is not true.</p><p>FOWLER: Hey, that's the year I was born.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It could be true, Dagen. It could be true. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: God bless you. God bless you. God bless you.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It could be true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, day 31 of the government shutdown causing a ripple through all agencies. We'll tell you about the important economic data that's getting postponed because of it.</p><p>And snatch and grab, watch as this bald eagle sneakily grabs a fisherman's catch of the day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Monday, January 21st. Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We have your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Shutdown showdown, day 31, President Trump, hitting back at Democrats after they rejected a new compromise to end the shutdown, meantime, the U.S. markets are closed today, in honor of Dr. King and the day that honors him.</p><p>Futures right now are trading, and we have a 113-point loss on the Futures. This, after the major market gauges finished higher for the fourth straight week. It's been a great start of the year, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 picking up nearly three percent, the NASDAQ, up nearly that much as well. A little bit shy on the gains on the Blue Chips and the S&amp;P.</p><p>Global markets are open, trading in England, France and Germany. Some mixed market action right now. The CAC Quarante in France and the DAX in Germany are both lower.</p><p>In Asia, we have all four major markets higher there, and it's worth noting that despite this report that China's economy is growing at the slowest pace since 1990, that the Chinese market did move up, maybe hopes on a trade deal with the U.S., maybe.</p><p>Fact check will tell you about the change that Bud Light is making, that has craft brewers on high alert.</p><p>And controversy on the Gridiron, the Rams, beating the Saints, to grab a spot in the Super Bowl.

They are incredible-looking birds up close, too. You get a real close-up look of that eagle.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, markets are closed today to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But we are open for business here, on the FOX Business Network. Take a look at the Futures there, pointing to a lower open this morning, 122-point loss on the Dow Futures, as a government enters day 31 of the shutdown.</p><p>Joining me now, Crossmark Global Investments Chief Market Strategist, Victoria Fernandez, Victoria, what do investors need to see, because even in the midst of the shutdown, we have had a rally in the markets to start the New Year, four weeks in a row. What are investors watching?</p><p>VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTMENTS: I think we're really watching earnings at this point in time. You know, at the end of last year, sentiment was really driving the volatility that we saw in the markets. People were very concerned about what the Fed was going to do. Most of the movement was headline-driven.</p><p>And I think now, we've shifted last week, as the banks really kicked off earnings. We've shifted and really focused on some more of the fundamentals and that's why we've seen the markets improved a little bit. But, now that we have more headline news coming out of Washington, when the markets reopen tomorrow, I think we may have some more headline-driven movement, that's why we're seeing Futures, down, a little bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, in terms of the earnings bank stocks last week, posted their strongest five-day gains in more than two years. The KBW NASDAQ Bank Index was up almost eight percent, 7.7 percent, so there was good news, even -- some of the reports were mixed, some earnings per share misses, like on J.P. Morgan. But Mitch, talk about that. Is that hopes for a better earnings season overall?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think so. And you could look at -- what's interesting is the market looked at all of that and parsed out the good news and didn't dwell on the bad news. And we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which was a complete flip from what we're seeing --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The whole last quarter was -- let's find any piece of bad news and sell into it. And we have the regional banks reporting mostly this week, and that's really closer to where the job creation is in this country. So, it looks like the regional banks are adding to the loan book, and they're strong, it may be a good sign that money is going into small business, which is the real job creator of the country.</p><p>BOLTON: I actually think we are going to hear some good news from them because if you looked at Bank of America's results, you know, one of their biggest things that moved the needle, positively, was lending, lending to all of us. It was the credit business. It was the debit business. So we should actually hear some good news, if that's in any indication.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we got good news from Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve saying we will be patient over and over and over again. Whether it was short term interest rate increases, but also looking at the balance sheet reduction, aware of the market's concerns about that.</p><p>And Maria, on Friday, on Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, spoke to Dick Bove, from Rafferty Capital Markets, about the Fed's decision to keep interest rates, steady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think the Fed caved to the President, don't you?</p><p>DICK BOVE, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, RAFFERTY CAPITAL MARKETS: Oh, I don't think there's any question about it. I think that one by one, these guys who've swung, recognizing that the Fed can't take that type of negative publicity on a constant basis from someone of that statue. They just can't take it. So, they cave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Victoria, maybe the Federal Reserve caved to the markets. We're in complete disarray. The credit markets were messy. People are having very hard trouble, even buying and selling and pricing higher grade debt. There was high yield debt issuance in the month of December. So, and, again, there was massive volatility in every corner of the financial markets.</p><p>So, what do you think the Fed does? Is the Fed on hold? Have they placated the markets enough for the next three months?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Yes. I'm not sure that I would say the Fed actually caved to the President. I do think all along, the Fed has been saying that they were going to be data dependent. They just saw the data as much more positive as I think the market did. And what they have done over the past month is, Powell has come out and really kind of taken the patient word that you were talking about. They're going to take a little bit of time.</p><p>So, maybe they're on hold for a little bit, but we still anticipate that with the strong consumer they were seeing, if earnings continue the way they are, if we get this GDP growth and, you know, around the 2-1/2 percent, then, I think we're going to see them continue to raise, maybe once in the first half of this year, and maybe a second time in the second half of the year.</p><p>So, I don't think they're done with this hiking cycle but I definitely think we're going to see a pause before they make another move.</p><p>FOWLER: So, Victoria, I have a question for you. So, we -- today's day --</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Sure.</p><p>FOWLER: -- 31, tomorrow would be day 32 of this shutdown. At what point does this shutdown start to truly impact the market and truly impact how folks make their trading decisions?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: You know, if you look at estimates right now, the direct effects, you know, missing their paychecks, is about 0.3 percent annualized on GDP. The indirect effects are about the same. Indirects, being contractors and things like that, as well as the market missing some of the economic reporting.</p><p>And that's where I think you're going to see the uncertainty come back into the market. If we're not getting retail sales numbers, if we're not getting housing numbers, it's hard for investors to then project out what they think the markets going to do, going forward and invest accordingly.</p><p>So, that's where I think it's going to get hit the most. You're looking if it goes -- the shutdown goes through the first quarter, about a one percent hit to GDP annualized. So hopefully, we get something this week to kind of take some of that uncertainty off the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And maybe some of the CEOs coming out and hammering all of these lawmakers and these politicians about them not working and not getting a deal done, rather than, you know -- rather than stepping back and trying to make nice-nice with the folks in Washington. Come out and start hammering them in those -- in those earnings calls. We shall see.</p><p>Victoria, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Victoria Fernandez. Meantime, wireless carriers stepping up the fight against robocalls, Cheryl Casone has the details, hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Dagen. AT&amp;T has been offering free robocall-blocking tool since two years ago. AT&amp;T says it has blocked nearly 4.4 billion robocalls since October 2016.

Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Be sure to join us tomorrow when MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Coming up, three in a row, the Patriots beating the Chiefs to earn a spot in the Super Bowl, for the third straight year, and the Saints won't be marching to the big game, the controversial no-call that's got the sports world talking, more, straight ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Super Bowl LIII is all set, but not without some controversy. Jared Max has the details, Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Good morning, Dagen. And nothing worse in sports than getting burned by the officials. The third straight year, Super Bowl will feature the New England Patriots. Super Bowl LIII will be played 17 years in the day since the Patriots beat the Ram since Super Bowl 36 where the dynasty began. They were underdogs in Kansas City, but the Patriots blew a 14-0 lead, found themselves trailing, so Sony Michel, fourth and inches, fourth-quarter touchdown and the Pats go in front. But less than 90 seconds later, the Chiefs would score. Later the Patriots would be able to still get in position to do what they could to setup to get a game tying field goal.</p><p>The Patriots eventually -- Rex Burkhead would score a touchdown and the game would wind up going to overtime. Thanks to the leg of Greg Zuerlein, who would go 48-yards to force O.T. for the Chiefs. And then, in overtime, Red Burkhead, with the game-winning touchdown, Patriots go all the way down to their first drive -- and New England is in the Super Bowl, winning 37- 31.</p><p>The NFC championship also went overtime. Major controversy. The Saints were in position to win the game and run out the clock. But watch what happened as the official somehow did not call pass interference on this play. Certainly, it should have been called; the Saints should have been able to keep the drive going, run out the clock, go for a field goal, a touchdown, but instead they have to go for a field goal and that puts them then back in front. But it was enough time for the Rams, who then got setup, and the Rams scored a game-tying field goal and then in overtime. They would win it on a Greg Zuerlein 57-yard field goal, the longest field goal in NFL playoff history. So, Super Bowl LIII, all set. It will be the Rams against the Patriots just like a 17 years ago. The Rams opened as a one-point favorite; now the Patriots are favored to win by a point-and-a- half. The Rams are going to wear those all blue and yellow throwback uniforms.</p><p>Is it time for pass interference to be a reviewable call? Saints head coach, Sean Payton, was livid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN PAYTON, HEAD COACH, SAINTS: For a call like that not to be made is just hard to swallow, and then to get a phone call that would call -- it should never -- not going to call. They said not only was its interference (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: The NFL will publicly admit: the officials missed the calls. Payton was told by the refs, they missed it. What does that do for them?</p><p>Phil Mickelson was in position when \"The Desert Classic.\" Lefty, though, didn't get the job done at the final round. He shot at 69 as Adam Long found himself all the way at the top of the leader board, lefty comes up short after an amazing start. \"The Desert Classic,\" Adam Long, wins it by one. Both games in overtime, what more could we ask for? The Saints can cry about a missed call, but you want to know what, they left points on the board, the first two drives of the game. And as a Minnesota Vikings fan, watching my team lose to the Saints nine years ago on the NFC title game burned, and that only happened because that bounty. They put up a bounty on Brett Favre. So, you know what, Saints, congratulations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, so you're saying that karma is a --</p><p>MAX: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She has a (INAUDIBLE) with a very long memory.</p><p>MAX: She's a beautiful --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, it comes back to bite you. But again, this is what hurts, I think the NFL in the game, is when -- so you're going to come out and say and admit that this no-call was a mistake, but what does that accomplish unless you're going to go back and replay it?</p><p>MAX: Nothing. You know how much money it costs, how much money Saints don't earn as a team, as a business by not going to the Super Bowl? All the money legally bet on this -- you have to make some changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do the Rams have a shot against the Patriots, though?</p><p>MAX: I think the Patriots, if they were able to beat the Chiefs in Kansas City, I think that they're going to win the Super Bowl and beat the Rams. Great matchup; the youngest coach, Sean McVay, turns 33 this week against the eldest -- the most tenured coach in Bill Belichick.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Tom Brady is like, what, 72?</p><p>MAX: 74, and still winning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes, I'm was just going to say, the first time he won the Super Bowl, right. Since then, we've had -- I was actually making a list for the tech conversation: iPhone, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, FitBit, none of those existed when Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl.</p><p>FOWLER: But that was definitely an amazing night in football.</p><p>MAX: It's great. Two overtimes.</p><p>FOWLER: Two overtimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what, and that's what makes people watch the game, that what makes people watch Super Bowl. Good to see you.</p><p>MAX: Good to see you. Happy Monday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I feel sorry for the Saints, though.</p><p>MAX: I do, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just -- I can't, I can't help it, because New Orleans is just awesome -- just in general. Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115. Coming up, it's Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

That's next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Today, we honor the life, the legacy of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King, known for his courageousness and faith but maybe, most of all, his gratitude. This quote by Dr. King: \"Words can never adequately express appreciation. Real appreciation must flow from the deep seas of the heart.\" Show that trait and civil rights icon. Joining me now is the author of \"Just Breathe,\" Mallika Chopra. Mallika, Dr. King would actually write letters of gratitude to his supporters, what do you thinks about this and this can carry us through every day of our lives and make us a better society?</p><p>MALLIKA CHOPRA, AUTHOR: So, gratitude actually -- recent research even shows the benefits in terms of physical health, emotional and mental health, as well as building empathy, helps you sleep better. So, the simple practice of gratitude actually has real health benefits as well. But on a day like today, I think we can really feel grateful for great leaders and role models in our life who have really transform society, and then we can learn ourselves about the power of dreaming of having gratitude and also teaching our children these skills.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, so gratitude is your word of the year.</p><p>FOWLER: It is my word of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you have a (INAUDIBLE) that you're showing us. How do you - - and you can get in here but how do you integrate gratitude into your life every day? Like, what is -- give, literally, an actually plan, seems so simple but sometimes it's not.</p><p>CHOPRA: So, it is actually simple. You can start with just practicing or saying what you're grateful for every night before you go to sleep. Think about your day. And if you're a parent, maybe you share something with your child that you're grateful for or ask them to think about gratitude -- what they're grateful for.</p><p>FOWLER: I think that's such an interesting point, especially like I think we live in a culture where it moves so quickly and everybody is upset about the line or the elevator not coming on time, or the train being late. So, how do we, in this society, as we get into this new year, like really have an attitude for gratitude given that we live in this impatient world.</p><p>CHOPRA: So, I think it's about learning how to self-regulate -- and that's why title of my book is \"Just Breathe.\" That just takes how do we pause and actually shift our attitude? And we can really do that -- I challenge people sometimes try to go through one hour of the day without criticizing, complaining or condemning someone else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have a good tip.</p><p>CHOPRA: And you'll realize.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go through one hour and don't start any sentence you use with I.</p><p>CHOPRA: It's a great one. That's a great one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to ask this though, today is Blue Monday, and I suffer with this. Like, I take massive doses of vitamin D. So, this is apparently the most depressing day of the year. It's because, we're past the shortest day of the year, so it's not the lack of sunshine may be, but again, this is when they've given up on their resolutions by now, bad weather, it's cold out. How do we shake that?</p><p>CHOPRA: So, one, the Blue Monday concept, I hope that people don't let other people influence them to feel depressed. I know today is one of the coldest days of the year here in New York. And I think, again, it's starting the day with what is my intention today. So, my intention today is to appreciate others, to feel gratitude. And once you shift your dialogue, your internal dialogue, you'll start noticing the positives.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is. Thank you so much.</p><p>FOWLER: Just breathe.</p><p>CHOPRA: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Meditate people. So, vaping -- maybe that's your stress release -- may soon go up in smoke to FDA's plans to ban e- cigarettes entire as teen use rises, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Despite the official government line remaining the same since 2013, the public's widely held perception of the NBN is as an abject failure.</p><p>Late last week Communications Minister Paul Fletcher put out a media release entitled \"NBN Co powers through FY19 rollout and activation targets\", in which he sought praise for NBN reporting that it had exceeded its rollout and activation targets for the 2018-19 financial year.</p><p>However, the supposed good news sank like a stone, as NBN news instead centred around revelations that NBN Co had floated the idea of carving out video streaming traffic - for applications like Netflix and Stan - and potentially charging more for it.</p><p>The so-called \"Netflix tax\" was met with widespread derision for its worrying nods towards the lack of net neutrality in Australia. But mainly for the implication that the NBN and its business model are clearly not fit for long-term purpose.</p><p>NBN has since attempted to hose down the topic, saying it was merely looking to assess whether handling streaming traffic was a problem for the retail service providers like Telstra, Optus, TPG and Aussie Broadband, which resell its network.</p><p>But the problem NBN and the government have in spinning their line now is that the general public cannot be hoodwinked as easily as they could when the Coalition came to power in 2013 and ripped up the original NBN fibre to the premise plan.</p><p>Back then comms minister Malcolm Turnbull and prime minister Tony Abbott told the country that Labor's proposed network was too expensive, and changed course to a multi-technology mix of lesser technologies, which it said would be completed quicker, more cheaply and be just as useful for citizens.</p><p>At the time the protests among the tech literate were deafening, but most voters paid scant attention as many were turned off by the tech talk, but that is no longer the case.</p><p>Citizens now tangibly see the limitations of the network that is being rolled out, and stories like the \"Netflix tax\" make them question what the point has been of subsidising a network that will seemingly struggle to offer the most basic of services affordably in the near future.</p><p>Rather than listen to the government talking up the completion of the NBN in 2020, citizens now want to know how it will be upgraded to cater to the growing needs as the next decade progresses.</p><p>There are no answers to that question and, regardless of how the economics of the original NBN may have played out, history will not look kindly on the politicians and their enablers who led the country down this path.</p><p>We are at a point when the technology underpinning communications and the services that run on top of it are mainstream life. It is hard to see how the government can fix its NBN predicament, but now is the time for it to grapple with big tech based on a position of expertise rather than politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc764nwrax4xevsxjsj1p</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHJ-KS11-JD34-V3DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information.

Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

In 2012, Facebook went public for $104 billion (unjustifiable at the time) and the Russians cashed out for $6 billion. Now worth $700 billion in market value, Facebook has grown to 2.6 billion users and $70.7 billion in advertising-related revenues, and is at the centre of Silicon Valley's biggest controversies involving ethics, breaches of privacy and content fraud.</p><p>Founder Mark Zuckerberg remains a friend of Milner's, whose investment fund went on to buy pieces of Twitter, Airbnb, Spotify and others. In 2009, Milner explained \"we have a unique perspective on this (social media) investment. \"We see something that other people don't see, because we see the monetization profiles of our other social networks in our (Russian) part of the world.\"</p><p>The result is Facebook has become to technology what Russia is to geopolitics: a slippery, intrusive, and often unethical player. The company flouts regulations, taxes, imposes censorship for totalitarian regimes, and provides a platform for lies, fraud, hate language, and questionable organizations or individuals. And Zuckerberg bobs and weaves past critics and regulators with the skill of a Pravda spokesman.</p><p>It's a problem that governments must address but don't very well. For instance, Facebook agreed to respect user privacy just before its 2012 IPO, but didn't. In 2019, Facebook was charged for privacy breaches seven years after promising the Federal Trade Commission to desist. It was hit with a record fine of US$5 billion ($6.8 billion), only a fraction of one year's profits. It also faces another $1.63 billion in Europe for the same misdeeds.</p><p>This year, Facebook also agreed to pay US$550 million ($745 million) to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations involving its facial recognition tool that allowed users to spy on one another through photographs. It was also sued for US$9 billion in unpaid taxes offshore by the IRS.</p><p>None of this fazes Zuckerberg. When called onto the carpet in 2018 - over Facebook's major role in contaminating the Brexit vote outcome - he refused to appear before parliament or to surrender archival information. Similar criticism in the U.S. about Russian and white supremacist Facebook posts and ads that influenced the 2016 election were greeted with surprise and nothing much else.</p><p>Recently, Zuckerberg ridiculed Twitter's crackdown on Trump inaccurate tweets and said his company would not be \"the arbiter of truth.\" This led to a boycott by 500 major advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Verizon) and a virtual strike by Facebook employees.</p><p>On June 25, word leaked out that Zuckerberg's \"team\" conceded they suffered from a \"trust deficit\" and were reaching out to advertisers and reviewing their policies. Then, on July 8, a report by civil rights auditors hired by Facebook slammed the company for providing a home to disinformation and hate, and opening the door to abuse by politicians.</p><p>Then by July 1, an unapologetic Zuckerberg told a town hall meeting of Facebook employees that the company was \"not gonna change\" as a result of the boycott. He added, cynically, that the boycott was merely a \"reputational\" issue, involved a small per cent of revenue, and would end \"soon enough.\" Facebook stock bounced back from a $60-billion drop.</p><p>On July 10, reports were that Facebook was considering a temporary ban on political ads in the final days of the November election in the U.S. - presumably to grapple with advertising and employee unrest. This did not satisfy critics.</p><p>But more bobbing and weaving will occur. He resists any curbs on \"political\" speech, or content in general, no matter how false or dangerous in democracies. But in dictatorships where it does business, Facebook censors to please authorities.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced strong restrictions on freedom of movement in a bid to counter the new coronavirus, as the European Union closed its external borders to foreign travelers. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some it can cause more severe illness. </p><p>(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)Governments and central banks are scrambling to find ways to keep businesses from going bankrupt as the virus outbreak grinds the world economy to a halt. A day after Wall Street endured its worst daily drop since the crash of 1987, European markets wavered, as did U.S futures markets. There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.  Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding. __________ GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: France's government is pledging 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the new aid will include tax breaks and a \"solidarity fund\" for struggling small businesses. \"This epidemic will be a catastrophe for all countries of the world,\" he said. \"The shock will be violent.\" The U.S. Congress is rushing to develop an economic lifeline for American households and businesses turned upside down. Democrats said at least $750 billion would be needed. And top White House officials briefing Senate Republicans at the Capitol said a similar-sized package needs to pass, and in a matter of days. Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits. (Ad) Some of the greatest opportunities can be found in small-cap stocks. Just over the last two years Fate Therapeutics (FATE) exploded from a low of $2.52 to $27 a share, Digital Turbine (APPS) rocketed from 85 cents to $8.50. The best part - there are other small cap opportunities that could double, triple, if not quadruple your investment over the next year. Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms The U.S. Federal reserve on Sunday made an emergency cut to its key interest rate. U.S. airlines are asking the government for grants, loans and tax relief that could easily top $50 billion. Other European governments have pledged tens of billions of euros (dollars) in aid and relief, as well as hundreds of billions in guaranteed loans. New Zealand vowed Tuesday to spend billions of dollars supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP. A large chunk of the new spending will go to businesses that have lost more than 30% of their income as a result of the downturn. Other money will go toward health costs, income support, and the airline industry. BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are banding together to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. HEAVY INDUSTRY: Volkswagen said it will close most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts. Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said Tuesday that uncertainty about the severity and duration of the virus outbreak made it impossible to give a reliable outlook for sales.  Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers. TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April. Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says now is the time for Canadians to come home. The government has mandated the screening of passengers by airlines before boarding. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways cut its flight schedule by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago. Hong Kong's airlines were already under pressure because of political unrest which has hurt tourism.  American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.  MARKETS: Global financial markets wavered between losses and gains after a brutal sell-off to start the week that gave the U.S. stock market its worst loss in more than three decades. Benchmarks in Paris, London, Hong Kong and Sydney were mixed Tuesday while Tokyo's benchmark was flat. U.S. futures were essentially flat.  The 12% plunge on the S&amp;P 500 Monday took place amid a growing consensus, from Wall Street to the White House, that a global recession may be imminent. Entire sectors of national economies are at risk. The Philippine stock market shut down Tuesday after the government imposed restrictions on movement in the capital. The investor-oriented ZEW index of German business confidence recorded its sharpest decline ever as Europe's economy faces an almost certain recession whose depth could exceed the one that followed the global financial crisis. The index fell to minus 49.5 points in March from plus 8.7 points in February, a fall of 58.2 points and the biggest drop since the survey began in 1991, the institute said Tuesday. Germany and other countries are restricting entry at the border and ordering many businesses to close, leading to a massive drop in sales and activity across Europe.  STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: With hopes of a rescue fading in a pandemic, the London fashion and furniture retailer Laura Ashley said Tuesday that it will appoint administrators to devise its direction going forward. The company's main shareholder MUI Asia said it will not be able to step in with the money that is needed. The company, which was an iconic presence on the U.K. high street during the 1980s, said in a prepared statement that the outbreak has had 'an immediate and significant impact,' and that 'ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation.\" Dollar Tree says it is temporarily suspending online ordering so that it can keep supplies in its stores amid the virus outbreak. Like Amazon, Target and Walmart, Dollar Tree has experienced a sharp spike in online orders as consumers scramble to secure staples while avoiding public places. Dollar Tree said most of the items on its website are still available in stores. McDonald's says most of its restaurants in the U.S. have closed their dining rooms and are operating drive-thru, takeout or delivery only due to the new coronavirus. Other major chains, like Starbucks are limiting capacity switching to carry-out only. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that restaurants in France and Canada have also closed their dining rooms, while those in Spain and Italy are completely closed. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open. McDonald's has 14,000 U.S. restaurants and around 37,000 worldwide.  _______ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Traditional media outlets are expecting a suite of measures that will level the playing field and allow them to better monetise their content.</p><p>The digital players fear the government will pursue intrusive and \"unworkable\" regulation over the algorithms behind their platforms. They are concerned that global regulators and authorities will be inspired by Australia's measures.</p><p>A source close to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the minister viewed the tech giants as an \"existential\" threat to media companies.</p><p>While Mr Frydenberg will embrace the report's findings, the government is expected to take some time to detail its full response to the recommendations. The wide-ranging implications and complexity of the ACCC report's contents may require extensive consultation.</p><p>Tough measures on competition and privacy would open up a new front in the government's fight with the tech sector, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already taken to task over its role in the dissemination of violent and extremist material online.</p><p>Labor MP Ed Husic said the global industry would be preparing for the report given its potential implications.</p><p>\"Big tech knows that a lot of regulators have taken a great interest in this and will be wondering if the tremors flying out of the pages of this report will be felt elsewhere,\" he said.</p><p>\"The sector should be rightly worried because they have snubbed their noses at calls to deal with these issues and now it's time for competition law to deal with their failure to act.\"</p><p>Accepting that sweeping changes are inevitable, the tech companies are preparing to mount a concerted effort to manage the report's findings to achieve the best possible outcome for their business interests.</p><p>The tech lobby has warned that many businesses would be harmed by measures designed to take on Facebook and Google. Smaller businesses and start-ups may not have the capacity to comply with sweeping new regulations.</p><p>Amid a strong stock market, media companies' share prices spiked on Thursday ahead of the report's release.</p><p>Seven West Media's share price jumped 9.4 per cent, Nine Entertainment Co (owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age) was up 2.8 per cent and Southern Cross Austereo increased 3.8 per cent in a strong trading day across the market.</p><p>The ACCC's preliminary report, released in December, recommended a swathe of changes including a new regulatory authority investigating algorithms and the ranking of news, an ombudsman to handle complaints and new rules requiring opt-in consent for the collection of data.</p><p>The additional oversight has seen existing regulators jostling for territory, with media sources believing the Australian Communications and Media Authority will be given an expanded role in managing the digital platforms. ACMA currently polices the television and radio broadcasters.</p><p>The report also suggested a further review of the regulations affecting traditional media companies, a news literacy program and tax-deductible news subscriptions for all Australians.</p><p>Traditional media companies have called on the competition watchdog to crack down on the market power of the tech giants, in particular Google and Facebook, to help them negotiate better rates and terms when using the businesses to share their content online. The ACCC has acknowledged that social media giants and search have become \"unavoidable business partners\" for publishers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520159791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-38Y1-JBJ7-N060-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><timeReceived>11:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Traditional media outlets are expecting a suite of measures that will level the playing field and allow them to better monetise their content.</p><p>The digital players fear the government will pursue intrusive and \"unworkable\" regulation over the algorithms behind their platforms. They are concerned that global regulators and authorities will be inspired by Australia's measures.</p><p>A source close to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the minister viewed the tech giants as an \"existential\" threat to media companies.</p><p>While Mr Frydenberg will embrace the report's findings, the government is expected to take some time to detail its full response to the recommendations. The wide-ranging implications and complexity of the ACCC report's contents may require extensive consultation.</p><p>Tough measures on competition and privacy would open up a new front in the government's fight with the tech sector, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already taken to task over its role in the dissemination of violent and extremist material online.</p><p>Labor MP Ed Husic said the global industry would be preparing for the report given its potential implications.</p><p>\"Big tech knows that a lot of regulators have taken a great interest in this and will be wondering if the tremors flying out of the pages of this report will be felt elsewhere,\" he said.</p><p>\"The sector should be rightly worried because they have snubbed their noses at calls to deal with these issues and now it's time for competition law to deal with their failure to act.\"</p><p>Accepting that sweeping changes are inevitable, the tech companies are preparing to mount a concerted effort to manage the report's findings to achieve the best possible outcome for their business interests.</p><p>The tech lobby has warned that many businesses would be harmed by measures designed to take on Facebook and Google. Smaller businesses and start-ups may not have the capacity to comply with sweeping new regulations.</p><p>Amid a strong stock market, media companies' share prices spiked on Thursday ahead of the report's release.</p><p>Seven West Media's share price jumped 9.4 per cent, Nine Entertainment Co (owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age) was up 2.8 per cent and Southern Cross Austereo increased 3.8 per cent in a strong trading day across the market.</p><p>The ACCC's preliminary report, released in December, recommended a swathe of changes including a new regulatory authority investigating algorithms and the ranking of news, an ombudsman to handle complaints and new rules requiring opt-in consent for the collection of data.</p><p>The additional oversight has seen existing regulators jostling for territory, with media sources believing the Australian Communications and Media Authority will be given an expanded role in managing the digital platforms. ACMA currently polices the television and radio broadcasters.</p><p>The report also suggested a further review of the regulations affecting traditional media companies, a news literacy program and tax-deductible news subscriptions for all Australians.</p><p>Traditional media companies have called on the competition watchdog to crack down on the market power of the tech giants, in particular Google and Facebook, to help them negotiate better rates and terms when using the businesses to share their content online. The ACCC has acknowledged that social media giants and search have become \"unavoidable business partners\" for publishers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520159791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-3SH1-JBJ7-N4SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><timeReceived>11:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

This would give a set of powerful tools. In the backdrop there is always the threat of big, cumbersome, costly antitrust cases.</p><p>\"I think there are a lot of companies that want predictability. This is a route for predictability in a way which is less cumbersome than some of the other ways to get that.\"</p><p>Moe data portability and competition from new players may mean that consumers could one day be paid for access to their personal data, Prof Furman suggested.</p><p>Speaking as the Worldwide Web turned 30 years old, he rejected claims by tech industry lobbyists that in digital markets competition is only ever a click away and that today's giants could one day fall victim to innovative upstarts.</p><p>\"I think 15 years ago you could think that even if there is one dominant platform at a point in time, who knows how long that platform will last? In the early days of the internet you went through Yahoo, Lycos, AltaVista, on your way to Google. But now it has been a while.\"</p><p>The review echoed calls by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/02/12/does-cairncross-review-address-issues-facing-uk-media-industry/\">last month's Cairncross Review of the funding of journalism</url> for the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to launch a formal study of the \"opaque\" digital advertising market that is dominated by Google and Facebook.</p><p>The CMA said it was considering such a move, but that its \"ability to launch new projects is heavily dependent on the outcome of EU exit negotiations\".\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Prof Furman also suggested that the CMA's approach to tech mergers \"needs a reset\". Watchdogs should be backed by new legislation to take \"firmer and more frequent\" action to challenge takeovers that could harm competition and innovation in the future, he added.</p><p>Scrutiny of mergers between companies that do not directly compete should also be tightened, the review said, and past takeovers should be revisited.</p><p>Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and Whatsapp, Google's acquisitions of YouTube and the advertising network Doubleclick\u00a0were all waved through but are now seen in the digital industry as crucial steps towards their dominance.</p><p>Prof Fruman said that under his proposals it was \"very plausible\" that some big tech mergers would have been blocked by the CMA, \"but the large majority wouldn't have been\".</p><p>The report, which the Government is due to consider and formally respond to in summer, is Britain's latest contribution to a global debate on how to harness the power of the web.</p><p>In Australia on Tuesday Rupert Murdoch's News Corp urged regulators to break up Google and its \"overwhelming\" power.</p><p>In the US the Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has pledged to attack Facebook over alleged abuses of personal data.</p><p>Prof Furman said moves to break up tech giants were premature, however, and that it should be possible to preserve the convenience of the big players while opening them up to new rivals.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/02/12/does-cairncross-review-address-issues-facing-uk-media-industry/\">Tax on Amazon and Google | What is digital services tax?</url></p><p>\"We're not recommending that and it is not the place I would start,\" he said.</p><p>\"If you adopted all these recommendations, you'd get all the benefits you get from being on a platform, while taking away some of the harms and abuses those platforms could undertake, and also enabling new entrants.</p><p>\"This is a really robust proposal.\u00a0I would rather go this route at least for now because it preserves the benefits while constraining the harms, as opposed to something I think would be more uncertain and potentially risky.\"</p><p>The Chancellor said \"we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market\" and that he will set out plans to implement the review's recommendations.</p><p>Mr Hammond is also drawing up plans for a new digital services tax to capture greater income for the Exchequer from the tech titans.</p><p>The lobby group techUK, which represents all the US tech giants identified by the review as well as smaller local players, said \"significant further detail is needed on what a proposed code of conduct might look like\" and that \"there must be a full assessment of the risks and benefits of requiring companies to open up data sets\".</p><p>Such issues raise important questions around the protection of personal data which may not easily be overcome. There may also be technical barriers to such a proposal due to the interoperability of data sets.\u00a0</p><p>Chief executive Julian David said: \"Such issues raise important questions around the protection of personal data which may not easily be overcome. There may also be technical barriers to such a proposal due to the interoperability of data sets.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52538179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-9481-F021-6551-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

A technology fellowship scheme will bring in \"outside experts\" to help policymakers generate new ideas and experiment with new technologies. </p><p>Elsewhere in the Digital Strategy, the government pushes the Government Digital Service's flagship digital identify verification scheme, GOV.UK Verify. </p><p>The programme, which has been in development for half a decade, currently has around 1.1m users, but the government has said it wants to increase this to 25 million registered users by 2020. </p><p>Verify has historically struggled to get buy-in from some of the larger departments, with HMRC coming under fire just last month for developing a separate identity assurance scheme for its business users. </p><p>However, the Digital Strategy says that, in a more digital economy, businesses will need \"a trusted framework\" to help them tackle online fraud and that widespread use of Verify would allow people to use the same account for both private and public sector services. </p><p>Meanwhile, the section on data brings together a range of various government announcements, including plans for more data sharing between departments, the appointment of a government chief data officer, a commitment to implement the EU's General Data Protection Regulation by May 2018 and work to build up public trust in the use of data by both government and businesses. </p><p>A major focus of the promotion of the strategy is a pledge to tackle the \"digital divide\", referring to people's inability to use digital technologies, either due to a lack of skills or infrastructure. </p><p>The government said it needed to take a more targeted approach to digital inclusion, which includes efforts to make libraries the \"go-to provider\" of digital training and support, and \u00a31.1m for training projects through the NHS. </p><p>\"Warm words\" </p><p>The Digital Strategy also sets out plans for a Digital Skills Partnership to coordinate the wealth of skills and training programmes across the UK. It will be led by government and involve businesses, charities and voluntary organisations, and aims to offer basic training for adults and prepare children for lifelong technology use from an early age. </p><p>Businesses making pledges through this partnership include BT, which is expanding its programme to help primary school teachers teach computing science, and Google, which is running a summertime scheme to boost growth in seaside towns. </p><p>Meanwhile, Lloyds Banking Group will offer face-to-face digital skills training to 2.5 million people, charities and small businesses by 2020, Barclays will teach basic coding to 45,000 children and the HP Foundation will create an online learning platform for disadvantaged groups. </p><p>The government also emphasised the need for a greater diversity in tech workforces, for employees to develop data analytics and cyber security skills, and to prepare for the impact new technologies such as AI, robotics and connected devices will have on workforces. </p><p>On connectivity, the government said it planned to look at it \"in a more holistic way\", adding that it would focus on what people need and want from connectivity, \"instead of focusing on the type of technologies\" on offer. </p><p>The Digital Strategy reiterated the \u00a31bn investment in digital connectivity that was made in the 2016 Autumn Statement, which aims to fund full fibre broadband plans and 5G, with a 5G strategy expected at the Budget on 8 March, and reiterated the commitment that the Universal Service Obligation, to be brought in by 2020, that will offer every home access to high speed broadband. </p><p>However, Labour's Louise Haigh, shadow minister for the digital economy, slammed the government for failing to live up to the expectations of those in areas lacking connectivity. </p><p>\"This strategy has been delayed for well over a year and the recycled announcements and meagre commitments will leave many wondering whether ministers have the vision our digital economy desperately need,\" she told CSW's sister title,PublicTechnology. </p><p>\"The government had warm words for digital infrastructure - the lifeblood of our economy in the decades to come - but the reality is millions are being left in the digital slow lane and today's announcements are more a case of what was not said rather than what was. </p><p>\"Our major cities, towns, swathes of our rural communities and thousands of small businesses are being left behind, and the government's failure to use this strategy to commit to universal superfast broadband represents a missed opportunity. The government are uniting rural farmers, urban coffee shops, and business park start-ups in a coalition against them. </p><p>\"This country deserves better than the second-best, out of date digital infrastructure the government are insisting they rely on.\" </p><p>Haigh added that, with 12 million people lacking basic digital skills, the commitment set out in the strategy would only train a third of them, which she said \"does not come close to meeting the challenge of digital illiteracy\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CVSCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CVSCOM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N0C-PW01-F0JV-82HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1184\"/><timeReceived>1:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Civil Service World (online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 1, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000576</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is Monday, June 26th. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ISIS targeting our government -- Ohio Governor John Kasich's Web site  hacked with messages threatening the president and his wasn't the only site  affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch in focus -- the Senate Judiciary  Committee now looking at her alleged interference.  Former House Oversight  Committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz weighing in on this probe saying both  sides of the aisle should get on board.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), UTAH:  To have Senator Grassley in the Senate  Judiciary Committee also going after this, it really is a pivotal moment.   And if the Democrats are going to be fair and balanced about this they  should be equally concerned about what Loretta Lynch did or didn't in her  role as attorney general.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A closer look at whether Lynch interfered with the Clinton e- mail investigation later this hour.</p><p>A scary scene at a California motel -- a car crashing through a brick wall  and into a pool filled with children and at least eight people injured.</p><p>Martin Shkreli heads to court -- jury selection for his fraud trial gets  underway today but he's already ignoring his lawyer's advice.  We have the  details ahead.</p><p>Plus Jeff Bezos has his eyes on the sky -- Amazon has a new patent for its  delivery drones.  The latest on his growing empire coming up.</p><p>Futures pointing to gains at the open -- you can take a look.  Gains across  the board, 64-point gain on the Dow futures right here right now.  The  Nasdaq composite on track for its eighth month gain -- eight months in a  row.  If you can believe it.</p><p>In Europe, we have buying across the board as well -- in England, France  and Germany.  </p><p>And in Asia overnight, same story -- green across that screen.</p><p>And celebrating 20 years of Harry Potter -- the book hitting shelves 20  years ago today and Facebook is getting in on the festivities.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  Maslansky and Partners'  president Lee Carter, market strategist Kevin Kelly and CFRA investment  strategist Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey -- what do you make of these markets?   Impressive.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  It's very impressive.  Also a  little bit worrisome given the run that we have had.  We're up almost 9  percent year to date.  That's usually what you get in one year on a good  year.  So I'm a little bit worried about what's going on in Washington and  how that could impact the markets because usually in the second half of the  year, starting August you start -- there's a seasonal trade down.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nasdaq eight -- on track for its eighth straight monthly gain --  the longest winning streak in as long as you've alive.  22 years</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, CIO, RECON CAPITAL:  Love it, baby.  Well yes, that's an  interesting point.  I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: You missed that.  </p><p>KELLY:  I know -- I am 22.  I love celebrating my second annual 21st birth  day just a while ago.  The best part is that technology has almost -- it  performed double that what the overall market has.  And so that's the  interesting aspect because it's leading it so technology is correlated to  the overall market 93 percent.  So where technology goes, the market is  going to go.  So it's largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 but I think the  interesting -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The longer the banks leading the way -- right.</p><p>KELLY:  -- right.  The interesting aspect, though, that we are not talking  about is the ten-year treasury is now at about 2.15 percent.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  And so that's a crazy signal.  So that's something to watch.  I  would have never predicted that when we started the year especially with  the fed raising interest rates.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And just one thing about the tech stocks -- that market fell off  and big tech names June 9th to the 12th that Facebook is now the first of  those tech titans to recover from that selloff.  The other ones Amazon,  Netflix, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft are still down from that selloff.</p><p>We have so much more to discuss this morning.  Coming up, one of our  favorite people on the planet Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano, the 2008 Clinton campaign chief strategist Mark Penn, and  Fortnum and Mason CEO Ewan Venters is also here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" Stuart Varney joins as well.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those fine gentlemen.</p><p>Returning to our top story this hour, Ohio Governor John Kasich's official  Web site, one of several government Web sites lacked with pro-ISIS  messages.  The message reads, quote, \"You will be held accountable, Trump;  you and all your people for every drop of blood flow from Muslim  countries.\"  A hacker group called Team System DZ is taking responsibility  for the messages.</p><p>Joining me now is conservative columnist Dr. Gina Loudon on what you make  of this hack.  Good morning -- Gina.  </p><p>GINA LOUDEN, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST:  Good morning -- Dagen.  Good to with  you.  I think, you know -- go ahead.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, no, no.  I just -- you weigh in on what you make of this  hack.  </p><p>LOUDON:  I was -- you know, my son reacted to this.  He's only 10 years  old.  He said, \"Wow, Mama, how in the world is President Trump going to  clean up all the messes that President Obama left behind?\"  This is  something that should have been addressed, these kinds of hacks going back  over the last eight years.  </p><p>But since Obama sat on his hand and did essentially nothing, instead of,  you know, focusing on the things that this President is so good at focusing  on like tax cuts and reductions in government and all the great things that  Americans need him doing, he's having to backtrack to take care of things.</p><p>ISIS should not be hacking us.  We should be hacking ISIS.  That's where we  should be with our cyber security.  So I'm really glad that President did  do the executive order -- I think it was just last week.  And is addressing  this and sharing this information between the states and the government  agencies.  It should be a great first step to fixing some of this.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  I think it's of particular  interest to me that they've chosen John Kasich's site as one that they're  going to be focused on especially with Kasich being such a vocal critic of  Donald Trump and such a vocal critic of the health care bill, of everything  that's happening right now.  And they are putting that on his site among  others.  Why do you they that they are choosing him?  </p><p>LOUDON:  Yes.  That's an interesting question.  It honestly --- I think  that it could be that they just really aren't aware of our inner workings  of politics that maybe that you and I are aware of because we pay attention  to it everyday.</p><p>But I also think that it could have been an attempt for more division among  the leading party in the United States.  I think that, you know, the more  they can sow that sort of division amongst leadership that actually is in  power right now, they might see that as some sort of advantage.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, actor John Depp, the latest celebrity to threaten the  President.  He was talking to a crowd in England at Glastonbury.  Depp  suggested assassinating President Trump.  This comes after Robert De Niro  said that he'd like to punch the President in the face, Madonna said she  thought about blowing up White House, again the Kathy Griffin, the  beheading that she somehow made herself the victim in all of that.  The  President's son -- the President's son Eric Trump responding to the threats  from Tinseltown.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC TRUMP, SON OF DONALD TRUMP:  There are no quarters for this people.   You see Johnny Depp and what he said, you know, I'd like to go assassinate,  you know, the President.  Johnny Depp has his own problems.  He has his own  problems.  Like how about you go back to making movies and doing your own  thing?</p><p>I mean this is a man who gave up his life to try and help this country.   And he's doing a great, great job and I honestly I couldn't be more proud  of him.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gina -- do you believe that these celebrities are actually  inciting violence.  They clearly are doing it -- these are celebrities  whose stars are fading or no longer exist and they are purely doing it for  attention.  But do you think that they are actually inciting violence as  well?  </p><p>LOUDON:  Absolutely.  And Dagen -- you make such an incredibly important  point.  The minute that somebody in Hollywood needs more attention or more  money, they decide to say something like this and there really is no  reprisal for this.</p><p>Whatever happened to Madonna?  Absolutely nothing.  But you know what it  does?  I mean could you feel more compassion for this son of the President?   I was surprised he held himself together making that statement -- Eric  Trump.  And I tell you, the more I see of this first family, the more I  feel just honored that they're sitting there in the White House, that they  are willing to expose their family to this.</p><p>They didn't need this just like Eric Trump pointed out and yet they have  really given up their time and their security, their own personal security  and that of their own children and grandchildren just to serve our country.   And I think that is one of the reasons that America wanted to see this  president in place and I thought that Eric Trump's words couldn't have been  nor poignant and more heartfelt.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, they run their mouths but all that money that they  throw at these Democratic candidates -- look at Jon Ossoff -- that got him  well, not elected.  That got him nowhere.</p><p>Nine -- what was it nine to one California donations to -- in the state of  Georgia -- donations in that election they lost to Karen Handel.</p><p>I do want to move onto health care.  Because speaking of word -- former  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted this on the GOP's bill.    This was late Friday, quote, \"Forget death panel.  If Republicans pass this  bill, they're the death party.\"</p><p>What do you make of that?  </p><p>LOUDON:  You just really want to put Hillary down for a long winter's nap  or something.  I don't know.  She really needs to stop injecting herself  because I really think that she looks like she's making a desperate gasp  every single time she opens her mouth.  And it's been that way since the  whole campaign and that's how she lost.  And that's why she was such a  horrible candidate.</p><p>And that's why the Democrats are at all-time lows in their fundraising.   And that's why Republicans are at all-time highs in there fundraising.  And  that's why the Democrats continue to lose that they are zero for four in  these special elections -- or zero for five, however you like to look at  it.</p><p>And as long as Hillary continues to be so dramatic -- sky is falling all of  the time, right -- the more the Democrats are going to continue to lose  because they have no leadership, they have no vision and they have no  ideals other than to try to bring our president down.  The American people  don't want that.</p><p>CARTER:  I mean this isn't just, I mean, ridiculous language.  This is  dangerous language.  I mean to reshape the Republican Party as the death  party in the wake of the shooting where we have Scalise still in the  hospital.  </p><p>LOUDON:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  We're talking about saying, this isn't -- this is so far beyond  just trying to reframe a party or trying to use language in a clever way to  try and, you know, shift perceptions.  This is actually going to the heart  of the issue that we have right now which is that people -- you're not just  against something.  If you're on the other side, you're evil.</p><p>You're not just -- you know, not providing care, you are going kill people.   This is unbelievably irresponsible from leadership.  She's taking the anti- message that she had in the campaign to a whole new level here.  And I  think that at a certain point the American people have to say, enough is  enough.  We can disagree respectfully but to go this far, I think, it's too  far.</p><p>LOUDON:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  And she's got to take accountability for this.  What do you think  is going to be the way that we can go forward without this kind of --  really inflammatory language where you're on such diametrically opposed  sides?  </p><p>LOUDON:  You're so right about this.  This is the dehumanization that the  left is using.  This is precisely what led to the shooting at the  congressional baseball game.  And they need to be held accountable for it.   I believe the American people are watching this very closely.  And I  believe that until they sort of take responsibility for this death, violent  environment that they've created, the American people will continue to hold  them accountable because they see it clearly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's a former politician who is gasping for relevance but also  inciting violence in the same stroke by using that kind of language.</p><p>But Gina -- you hear it from all of the Democratic leadership about how  Republicans don't care about people's health, that they want to hurt  people, they want people to -- you hear even language about people dying  from cancer.  And this is going to be more of the same if this -- if this  healthcare bill comes -- if the Republicans in the Senate can pass it that  they've got -- they've got to counter this message because it's not going  to end.  </p><p>LOUDON:  That's right because what the Republicans -- the message that  Republicans need to seek with the American people is that real compassion  comes in giving people bootstraps, right, and telling people you can pull  yourself out of where you are.  And that you can save your money in health  savings accounts, for example, and be responsible for your own health care.</p><p>The government doesn't need to be your daddy because that's what we spent  the last eight years learning to reject.  And that is what the American  people went to the ballot box to reject over and over again.  And I believe  that ultimately the American people do -- we love personal responsibility,  right.  We love, you know, owning our own lives.</p><p>And that is what is quintessentially American and I think ultimately that's  what we will come out with, with our health care.  I think that we will  never settle for socialized medicine that the left has tried to impose on.   And I think that's why they're continually losing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we are in a situation now, Gina, where you are giving the  government and bureaucrats and lawmakers more power over your health care.   And until people wake up and realize that, that again, it could come too  late.</p><p>Dr. Gina Loudon, it's good to see you.  </p><p>LOUDON:  Good to see you -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care -- Gina.</p><p>Coming up Martin Shkreli heads to trial for fraud.  The charges against the  former pharma executive once dubbed the most hated man in America.</p><p>And today marks 20 years since Harry Potter first cast his spell on  children around the world and adults.  How fans can join the anniversary  celebration for the first book in the hit series?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two U.S. Marines seriously burned in an explosion in San Diego.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Good morning -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Good morning -- Dagen.</p><p>Yes, that's right, these marines were injured while doing maintenance on a  fighter jet at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.  This happened just last  night.  The base says that they were rushed to the UC San Diego Regional  Burn Center.  A spokesman says the service members belonged to a reserve  squadron that is based out of Fort Worth, Texas actually.</p><p>Well, an SUV crashing into a motel swimming pool.  This happened in Los  Angeles.  That pool was filled with kids.  Police say eight people were  injured when a driver of a vehicle lost control in front of the motel,  crashed through a brick wall, landed right into the pool.  This happened  last night.</p><p>Sources are saying the children in the pool were not seriously hurt but  were taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated just to be safe.  And cops  say the driver appeared to be in his 20s.  They're investigating whether he  was under the influence of drugs or possibly alcohol.</p><p>Well, Martin Shkreli goes on trial today in a Brooklyn federal courtroom  for allegedly defrauding investors.  But the former pharmaceutical CEO  doesn't seem to be worried about it.  In fact he tells the Associated press  he's excited and he can't wait.  Prosecutors say Shkreli lost millions of  dollars through bad trades and his side business that was a hedge fund,  that he eluded (ph) a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay  that hedge fund -- those investors back.</p><p>His defense team says he never intended to scam anybody and that everybody  was paid back.  Prosecutors differ on that one. </p><p>Well, it has 20 years since J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter was first  introduced to readers around the world.  The eight Potter novels have sold  more than 450 million copies over years.</p><p>And to mark the 20th anniversary, Kevin Kelly, Facebook has a new feature  for you.  I know you love this.  When you type the name of any of the four  Hogwarts houses into a poster comment it appears in that house's color and  then an animated wand appears when you click on the names which cast a big  spell.</p><p>I just kind of think you might be into it.  I don't -- I'm guessing  actually.  You like a Potter -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I actually used to go to the drive-in movie theaters back in  Arizona.  So they were great films.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Really?  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I mean I'm not disputing that they're great films but -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.  The drive-in movie theater -- I know it was right there  on the reservation.  And it was perfect.  It was packed.  I can't tell you  how many -- it was always, always packed for Harry Potter films.  You had  families, people bring out couches, watch it.  It was a great time.   Everyone was sharing popcorn.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is it wrong that I rooted for Voldemort?</p><p>KELLY:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It just seemed right at the time.</p><p>Still ahead, Loretta Lynch in the hot seat -- the former Attorney General  facing new questions over her role in the Hillary Clinton e-mail server  scandal.  What to expect from the Senate investigation?</p><p>And Amazon's vision for the future generating a lot of buzz.  The wild new  beehive for delivery drones that might be coming to a neighborhood near  you. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon moving forward with its drone delivery plans.  New images  from a patent application show how the company would tailor its fulfillment  centers.  They show a beehive shaped tower and the application for the  patent says that this would help the company make deliveries in urban  areas.</p><p>Joining us now is Mashable tech editor Pete Pachal.  This may not be what  the final version looks like but it does give you insight into Jeff Bezos'  brain, I guess. </p><p>PETE PACHAL, TECH EDITOR, MASHABLE:  Yes.  He's definitely thinking long  term on this.  Yes.  You can just imagine in the future every city has an  Amazon drone beehive at the outskirts that, you know, that's just  constantly buzzing.  </p><p>But it's interesting.  If you compare this idea with the very first  unveiling of Prime Air which is what they're apparently going to call this  drone service -- that was like a drone at the end of like a conveyor belt.   And it was basically the drone tacked on to this already human warehouse.</p><p>So basically what this does is kind of flip the script on that.  It's like  ok, let's think drone first.  You know -- and the humans are extra.  You  know, like the drone is the driving force within this warehouse.  What  would that look like?  And they came up with this which is -- ok, it's  looks a little like something from out of the matrix but, you know, I can  definitely see the line of thinking there.  </p><p>KELLY:  But can rules and regulations get to there because the drone market  is very heavily regulated and the FAA is going to have something to do with  it?  Is this even feasible or conceptual to put in reality?  </p><p>PACHAL:  I think it's feasible but absolutely, you're 100 percent correct  that the regulatory and safety issues have yet to be fully resolved.</p><p>Amazon is obviously thinking a lot about that as are others like Google.   And what ultimately needs to happen on these drones is there needs to be  like multiple redundant systems so that if one fails, another one that's  completely independent can take over.  I mean really that's the only way  you could safely have these aircraft in the air all over the place with a  human below even if it is a sparsely populated region.</p><p>So they're thinking about this.  So this is definitely longer term.  I mean  again, the first days of this is going to be drones tacked on to those  Amazon warehouses and eventually it will get this maybe, I don't know,  decades in the future.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Bezos empire is growing rapidly, of course, especially in  the wake of the Whole Foods acquisition.  This is the kind of move that I  was standing in a Starbucks and when it was first announced, I was flying  back -- I think I was at the Milwaukee airport and the people at Starbucks  are like hey, oh, my gosh, check your phone, Bezos is buying Whole Foods.   So it was that kind of reaction.</p><p>PACHAL:  Get your latte quick because, it could be Starbucks next.  Yes, it  was huge.  I mean, you know, not many people and companies can really upend  whole industries, you know, with a quick action like that.  I think I read  somewhere there was something like 50 million or -- sorry, 50 billion, 60  billion market cap difference when you take into account how much his  competitors fell and how much Whole Foods went up.  </p><p>KELLY:  But Amazon is focused on groceries?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes, very much so.  And this dovetailed nicely with the systems  they were unveiling a few months ago, Amazon Go which is that grocery store  of the future where there are no lines and there's intelligent systems  throughout the store to know what you're taking off the shelf and know  what's in your bag.  And you basically just walk out because it just  tallies up you're -- what you've taken and bills your Amazon prime account.  </p><p>BELL:  So what's next, the Bezos empire, like you said it's a huge one,  they're in the grocery, they've got their hand in a little of everything --  where does he go next?  What's the next -- what does he have his eye on?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, it's hard to predict.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're kidding.</p><p>PACHAL:  The thing is, he's learned some lessons about not getting into  places he should not.  Whenever people talking about Jeff Bezos and like  how he's brilliant and how he can move whole industries -- I always say  remember the fire phone where he came out and decided, ok, I'm going to do  this phone because I need to compete with Amazon and Google.</p><p>He felt pressured and if you read the reports on how that was conceived, he  very much was very hands on and micromanaged the design of that.  It was a  complete flop.  It did not work.  </p><p>So he is not infallible.  And he can do things wrong.  So I think he's  learned from that.  You can see his acquisitions and his actions since like  the Whole Foods -- what makes a ton sense for his empire, but you know,  you've got to have to caution that -- </p><p>KELLY:  But he pivoted and moved it fast -- the fire phone flopped but  guess what he came out with?  The echo and now everyone is following  Amazon's lead in that regard.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Exactly.  And he does have an ecosystem.  And I love also how he's  leveraging Amazon to sell the Echo.  I mean there's all these other  companies like Apple's Siri and Google Home -- they are coming out with  these speakers.  But -- we are all trained to go to Amazon.com to buy  pretty much everything we want.  And he has that portal to sort of put the  echo and those products in front of everyone.  Hey, you want this, you want  this.  You're buying some back scratchers.  Hey, you want this Echo, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm old enough to remember when he was working at a hedge  fund here in New York City before he even founded Amazon.  </p><p>PACHAL:  I met him at a dinner like about 15 years ago when Amazon was just  expanding into consumer electronics, selling on line.  And kind of -- he's  changed a lot, I would say, he was much more outgoing and gregarious at  that dinner and I see him speak publicly now and he's obviously a changed  man and he's really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not giving you any ideas.</p><p>PACHAL:  Yes -- very guarded now.  But I mean he's also -- I still see that  sort of genius and that excitement in sort of his ventures.  You looked at  Blue Origin which could, in the long term be his most lucrative venture in  shipping things to space.  There's a lot (inaudible).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Pete Pachal -- good to see you.  Thank you so much.  We covered  a lot of ground.</p><p>PACHAL:  My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.</p><p>Coming up: the investigation into Loretta Lynch -- senators launch a probe  into the former Attorney General's role in the Clinton e-mail scandal.   Judge Andrew Napolitano will take a look at the legal implication.</p><p>And Facebook making friends in Hollywood -- look out Jeff Bezos.  The  social media giant is trying to take on Netflix and Amazon Prime with its  own original content.  The huge cost the company is reportedly willing to  pay for new shows.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 26th.  Your top stories at 7:30am Eastern Time.</p><p>It's Energy Week at the White House, President Trump set to host the Prime  Minister of India in Washington this afternoon.

Former Attorney  General Alberto Gonzales weighing on the probe with our own Maria Bartiromo  on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I think that they're all legit  in the questions raised by some of these allegations and I think that it's  perfectly appropriate for the congress.  The Judiciary Committee to examine  exactly what happened here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The details on that investigation ahead.  SpaceX pushing the  final frontier, the company launching and landing not one but two rockets  over the weekend, what the move means for the space race coming up.</p><p>And Facebook taking on Tinseltown, the details as the social network hits  the walk of fame in search of scripted content, it's going to cost them.</p><p>Futures showing the market gains across the board in Europe as well.

The Senate Judiciary Committee looking for answers from Loretta Lynch  on whether or not she intervened in the Clinton email server investigation.   One of the question in the letter to Loretta Lynch reading, \"During your  time in the Justice Department, did you ever have communications with  Former DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her staff, her  associates, or any other current or former DNC officials about the Clinton  email investigation?\"  </p><p>Let's bring in Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.   Judge, can they force Loretta Lynch to testify?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Yes.  Of course  they can force Loretta Lynch to testify.  </p><p>I agree essentially with what Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told  Maria yesterday in the clip that you just ran but I would actually extend  it one step farther, there is enough evidence here just on the basis of the  little snippets given to the Senate Intelligence Committee by Former FBI  Jim Comey that Mrs. Lynch was either conflicted or working at odds with the  Justice Department and in behalf of Mrs. Clinton's campaign and the DNC  when she told them to use different terminology for the investigation.</p><p>Now the terminology really doesn't matter, the FBI was investigating Mrs.  Clinton anyway, but the terminology, let's call it a matter not an  investigation.  This result to some FBI agents teasing the director saying,  \"Oh, you're not the director of the Federal Bureau of Matters rather than  Federal Bureau of Investigations.\"  But the terminology maybe indicative of  a mindset on the part of Attorney General Lynch that she was going to do  whatever she could to prevent Mrs. Clinton from getting indicted and the  Senate Judiciary Committee is entitled to inquire into that.</p><p>So is the Justice Department.  This is not under Bob Mueller, this does not  involve with the Russians.  The DOJ itself, Jeff Sessions can assign a team  of investigators, FBI agents, and prosecutors to investigate his  predecessor as to whether or not she obstructed justice or behave in a way  that constitutes misconduct in office by preventing or doing everything she  could to slow down or impede the investigation of Mrs. Clinton.</p><p>KELLY:  Judge, wasn't it not only just what happened with Comey's testimony  but there's also assertions that she actually did tell other democratic  operatives from -- that she would prevent this matter from going too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's the reason for the question that Senator Grassley's  people wrote to Attorney General Lynch about her communications with Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida and at the time the Chair  of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>It is alleged, this document has not seen the light of day if it exists  that there is one or several emails between Debbie Wasserman Schultz and  Loretta Lynch concerning the behavior that Loretta Lynch will take to  further the DNC interest while Mrs. Lynch was the Attorney General.  That  if it happened would be misconduct in office.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's the punishment then?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well it's a felony depending upon exactly what charge -- what  they charged her with, it could be five or ten years.  In jail it's very  serious, it's the equivalent of obstruction of justice, same allegations  they're making about the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Incredible.  Let's move on to Supreme Court Justice, Anthony  Kennedy is said to be -- there have been some reports out that he is  considering retirement but Kennedy has given no indication if that is true  or not.</p><p>The 80-year-old court veteran has long been viewed as the critical swing  vote among his peers, often casting the breaking vote on contentious cases.   White House Advisor, Kellyanne Conway refusing to divulge if Kennedy had  reached out President Trump about his future, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  I will never reveal a  conversation between a sitting justice and the president or the White House  but we're paying very close attention to these last bit of decisions and I  can tell you one thing, just as the president did with Justice Neil  Gorsuch, whenever there are vacancies, whenever that happens, he will look  for somebody who has fidelity to the constitution, he doesn't make up the  laws, they go along.  And somebody who has a judicial temperament and a  record that's beyond repose as to Justice Gorsuch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Look, there's a couple of moving parts here, Justice Kennedy  did tell friends years ago during the either first or second Obama  Administration, I don't remember which that as soon as there was a  republican in the White House he would seriously think about leaving.</p><p>He's been in the court for 33, 34 years and he's 80-year-old.  Justice  Kennedy, this is intriguing, scheduled a weekend sort of get to together  with all of his former clerks, one of whom is Justice Gorsuch for the fall  of 2018, they moved that to this past weekend.  Hint, maybe he won't be on  the bench in the fall of 2018 on the other hand, he has four incoming  clerks whom he's hired who are coming in in the fall of 2017.  So we're  getting mixed signals.  He will either make an announcement from the bench  this morning at 10:00am Eastern Time when the court convenes or he will  decide, \"You know what, Neil Gorsuch is my former clerk, he's a brilliant  wonderful justice, I want to enjoy a year or two working with him on the  court before I go.\"  It got to be one or the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Could we also get some sign from the court this morning of what  they might do, some kind of guidance on the president's executive order?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think we're going to get more than a sign we're going to get  an announcement.  They're either -- they are scheduled to release  announcements on applications for this isn't a case before them because  it's not over with it, it's an application for emergency relief.</p><p>They are scheduled to issue orders at 9:30 this morning about how they're  disposing of them.  If they simply say denied, that means that the stays,  stopping the president's travel ban, stay in place until these cases are  tried.  If they do anything other than denied, they will have to have some  specificity in there.  The question is, should the travel ban stay in place  while it is tried in a federal court in Hawaii and a federal in Minneapolis  or should it not stay in place?  Well, it's being tried.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well the answer is --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It still hasn't been tried.</p><p>KELLY:  The answer is yes, right?  I mean --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well is there any way to know what they're going to say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No.  There's no way to know, it's going to come out in two  hours.  We'll find out then.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's very exciting.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Big day.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We have producers in the courtroom, we'll know immediately.   It's going to come out and we have red flags and white flags so we'll know  because they take your Blackberries and your Iphones when you're in there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I remember the red flags during the Martha Stewart verdict.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Actually, it wasn't flags, it was scarves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, yes.  I'm kidding about the scarves, I don't know the  means of communication but Fox people will know first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So 9:30 for that and then maybe 10:00 we'll hear from --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, 10:00 we're waiting on a very interesting opinion about  whether or not when the state gives money to schools to repave playgrounds  they can give it to catholic schools as well.</p><p>KELLY:  This is the Missouri case?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think it was -- yes, this is the Missouri case, yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at the showoff over there.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Why is -- he's always there, he's a smart kid.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I make -- my goal is to make you laugh and I think -- incredibly  insight from Judge Andrew Napolitano as always, such a pleasure Judge.   Thank you. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a new milestone in the final frontier, SpaceX  blasting off twice in one weekend.  What the incredible fee means for the  future of private space travel in a private space company.</p><p>And Facebook hoping users will like what they see, how much the company is  reportedly planning to spend to bring their own TV shows to the social  media network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rescuer searching for survivors from a tourist boat that  capsized on a reservoir in Columbia.  Cheryl Casone has the details on  that, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Dagen, at least nine people  have died in this accident, 28 still missing.  Recreational boats and jet  skis rushed out to the scene, they were pulling people from the boat as it  went down.</p><p>But they avoided even a deadlier tragedy by getting there as fast as they  could, this all went down yesterday.  Right now it's unclear of what caused  the boat to sink but survivors say that it appeared to be overloaded and  that nobody onboard was even wearing a life jacket.</p><p>Well SpaceX is going back-to-back, Elon Musk company pulling off two  commercial satellite launches from opposite coast within 48 hours.  Both  launches went off about a hitch provided the strongest sign yet that SpaceX  is on track to ramp up their launch tempo.</p><p>And TV shows may soon be coming to Facebook.  The Wall Street Journal  reports that the social network is looking to Hollywood to help produce  original content for its platform and this could start as early as this  summer.  The push for TV shows is the company's efforts target the tens of  billions of ad dollars that's spent on TV.  Facebook is telling Hollywood  producers they will share viewership data with them, the only difference on  this Dagen, of course, some of these would have advertisements on them  included.  You go to Netflix, they don't have that.  But on the Facebook  issue you would.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Coming up -- Lindsey was caught on  camera there real quick.  You were just reading.  You were just reading,  again, doing research.</p><p>BELL:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's okay.  Would you -- quickly, would you watch original  content on Facebook?</p><p>KELLY:  Depends on what it is.  Probably not just given their bend but they  have to do this because a lot of the videos are being repurposed and  advertisers are getting mad at them because it's not original and it's  really repurposed and taken from other sites.  So this is a response to  that so this is a response to that.  But content is key, it's going to be  expensive for them.</p><p>CARTER:  I think it's expensive.</p><p>BELL:  It could be a big game changer for them, I really think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But it also would drive up the cost of the content for  potentially Netflix and Amazon and Hulu and HBO.  The more players you have  with big wallets, the more that content is going to cost.</p><p>KELLY:  Well they need the content to be good though, that's the issue.  So  if they could -- if Facebook's willing to pay for it and it's really good  content then yes.  But if they're -- if it's not, we'll have to see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I watch the Dodo, you know what I'm talking about?  It's all the  --  </p><p>KELLY:  The Dodo?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dodo, it is animal videos.  That's all it is, it's like  short animal videos and it's awesome.</p><p>CARTER:  I'm all about the animal video.  </p><p>KELLY:  So where is that?  What platform?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's on -- you know what, pick your platform baby.</p><p>KELLY:  Oh, love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Instagram but it's largely Facebook delivered platform.</p><p>KELLY:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dodo, that's my suggestion this morning.  From bunker to  birdie, Jordan Spieth's epic shot at the Travelers Championship that earned  the young golf star a place in the history books.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The biggest celebration in golf used to be the Tiger Woods fist  pump now it's the Jordan Spieth chest bump.  Jared Max is here with that  story.  Good morning Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, this is not our  grandfather's PGA Tour.  Yesterday in Cromwell, Connecticut 23-year-old  Jordan Spieth gave us a highlight and celebration we're sure to see for  years to come.</p><p>The final round of the Travelers Championship, Jordan Spieth goes to a  playoff against Daniel Berger.  Watch this, first playoff hole, from the  bunker 60 feet away, the sand goes flying and the ball goes flying right  into the hole, a beautiful shot, watch this.  Listen to how it sounded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And right down that (inaudible) he's done it again just  as he did it with John Deere for his first win.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  And just like at John Deere number one, this is victory number ten.   A birdie for Spieth, wire-to-wire win at the Travelers.  At the 10th  carrier win, he's now over $32 million in carrier earnings.  Yesterday, a  $1.22 million purse for Spieth.</p><p>And hey, speaking of a purse, check out what the St. Louis Cardinal fan  found in her bag last night at the Cards Pirates Game.  Bottom of the  seventh in, Yadier Molina has a foul ball into the stands, where did the  ball go?  You've heard of the basket catch?  Well this was a purse  snatching grab by a fan.  \"Honey, I have a little stuck in my mouth, any  change you have a toothpick or a flossy in your -- no, but I have a  baseball.\"  Cards beat the Pirates 8-4, what a grab.  </p><p>Congratulations also to Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Tim  Tebow.  Promoted by the New York Mets Organization from low single A ball  by the Columbus Fireflies to high single A ball with the St. LouisMets in  Florida.  Tebow batting only two 22 with three homers, 69 strikeouts or for  212 a bats, general manager of the Mets Sandy Alderson said the bottom line  is the average isn't there but he's improving.</p><p>Well Sunday marked the annual old timers day at Yankees Stadium in the  Bronx, New York.  It was Brooklyn where the inaugural game for the old  timers three-on-three basketball league got underway.  And nearly 16,000  fans showed up to Barclay Center, there were four games between NBA all  timers.  Now this league created by a rapper/actor Ice Tea, a lot of  celebrities on-hand yesterday.  Now Allen Iverson for one of the teams, the  hall of famers a coach, a player, and a captain but he only played nine  minutes yesterday. </p><p>The games are funky, if the first team to 60 points and you have to win by  two in the first two games went beyond -- went the distance and then kind  of into overtime.  They also have a four point shot.  And I think this is  great.  I mean you could get almost 16,000 people to watch three-on-three  basket and this is going to become to Olympics eventually too.  Not with  the old timers but wouldn't you like to see the old timers?  </p><p>KELLY:  Which Olympics?  The 20 --  </p><p>MAX:  2020 I think this one is going to be there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you watch the NASCAR race?  It's one of the -- it's the only  race a road course -- two road courses every year and this was the first  one of the season at Sonoma.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Kevin Harvick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin Harvick.</p><p>MAX:  Who he wins for the first time in like 21 races yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like first win this season, he races for Stewart-Haas, racing  his first win in a Ford.  See, Stewart-Haas made this major move from  Chevrolet to Ford at the start of the season.</p><p>MAX:  And it was one, two, three, Ford.  Ford was win (inaudible) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is a very big deal for both Ford Motor Racing and for  Stewart-Haas and for Kevin Harvick because, again, a win guarantees you a  place in the playoff which starts up later this year.</p><p>And then there was, of course, Danica Patrick wrecked into her boyfriend,  Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. she still finished I think P17 but --  </p><p>MAX:  Kyle Busch's crew.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I kind of enjoy that.</p><p>MAX:  What's with Kyle Busch's crew?  Is he getting in trouble again for,  what, loose lug nuts?  Already in trouble.  Yes, I mean, right?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It was --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why are you giggling?  Loose lug nuts are very serious problem.  </p><p>CARTER:  It's sounds like it's code.</p><p>MAX:  Well he had two improperly attached lug nuts because it's from silver  room where the guy is like, \"Yes, it was the lug nut.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He had a bad race several weeks ago and he acted like basically  his child, he acted like a baby in the kind of after race press conference.   So it comes down for poor behavior.</p><p>MAX:  We're going to see that Jordan Spieth highlight in years to come.  We  know that Tiger Woods did this, we're going to see that chest bump for some  time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the crowd went wild.</p><p>CARTER:  I love the excitement.</p><p>MAX:  And the crowd went wild.  \"Go to the hole.  Go to the hole.\"</p><p>BELL:  (inaudible) really?</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is golf.  Golfers have -- you have to kind of keep quiet but  --  </p><p>MAX:  Imagine Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player colliding with their caddies?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you just say Jack Nicholson?</p><p>MAX:  No, Jack Nicklaus.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You said Nicholson.</p><p>MAX:  You can't handle the truth.  </p><p>KELLY:  He came to (inaudible) </p><p>MAX:  Here's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well maybe I just heard Nicholson.  We should do -- hey, let's  go to the videotape.</p><p>MAX:  Let's go to the video and see one hole.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Jared.  Good to see you.  Jared Max.
