That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p>I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated. In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p>I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be  worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech.  Big Tech  monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Social media a perfect storm:</p><p>Can it survive?</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>It's time to break up</p><p>the internet giants</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>Your Turn</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p>Guest columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSST-mon-1856897883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-GVN1-JC3H-014M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255266</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News-Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News-Star (Monroe, Louisiana)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become.</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence.</p><p>Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse.politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy.

That seems to be the question many are asking today. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous \u2013 like incitement to riot \u2013 or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>In fact if I were Facebook, et al., I'd be particularly worried by something I noticed at the conference: Both left- and right-leaning speakers don't like them and want them brought under control.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech. When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p>Columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Glenn Harlan ReynoldsColumnistEric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMAPP-uscp75k2qexqtt01dcaqq895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMAPP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W71-62G1-DXVP-V0XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Commercial Appeal, Inc.

That seems to be the question many are asking. Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p>I saw this firsthand  recently when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs, scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become. (And they're quite consciously designed to be addictive.)</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>Thus today's social media world tends to give us the worst possible outcome: lots of angry, ill-informed speech, coupled with censorship of things that the platform owners don't like or are pressured into killing. Add to that a tremendous loss of privacy as platforms monetize people's personal data, and it's easy to see why the tech giants aren't as popular as they once were.</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy. Big Tech should be worried.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The Social Media Upheaval,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWJNL-wil-1856927495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7W-GVN1-JC3H-01DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255272</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 2, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When it comes to voicing a contrary opinion on the most sensitive political and cultural topics, however, many of our tongues are tied and our fingers shy away from the keyboard. Better not to say anything, we reason, than to deal with the blow-back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer to this speech-chilling political correctness is not a new law but personal courage, free-speech attorney-turned-writer David French of the National Review Institute argued this past week in a speech in Atlanta.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a position that is different from the classic defense of free speech in this country,\u201d French said.</p><p> Rather than admitting none of us knows everything and thus some humility is in order, too many</p><p> Americans won\u2019t accept they may need to change their minds</p><p> from time to time. Or that they would benefit from explaining their own opinion and not shouting down their opponents.</p><p> Much of the problem stems from what\u2019s been called \u201cthe big sort\u201d \u2013 the physical movement of people toward places where their neighbors will be more like-minded.</p><p> \u201cAmericans are less likely to live near and work with people who disagree with them than at any time since we\u2019ve been measuring that,\u201d French said.</p><p> But because people tend to become more extreme in their views when they talk only with those who agree with them, we\u2019ve lost not only our willingness to engage with others but also the belief we even need to do so.</p><p> How bad has it gotten? \u201cPeople are more likely to prefer their son or daughter marry a person of a different faith than a different political party,\u201d French said, quipping that for many on the right, \u201ceternal damnation is preferable to a Democrat.\u201d</p><p> Although these attitudes concern politics, count French as someone who does not believe there\u2019s a political solution. Rather, a cultural solution is needed. And that\u2019s where the personal courage comes in.</p><p> \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated into silence,\u201d he said, because that silence becomes self-reinforcing and makes it harder to speak up the next time.</p><p> But the answer is not to fight fire with fire.</p><p> \u201cThe opposite of political correctness is not acting like a jerk,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s speaking the truth with grace and humility and fearlessness. There is such a thing as being fearlessly reasonable.\u201d</p><p> Along with that is a legal corollary to the Golden Rule: \u201cDefend the rights of others that you would like to exercise yourself.\u201d</p><p> And an answer to the \u201csnowflake\u201d mentality on many college campuses: \u201cDo your best to be un-offendable. Be a walking safe space for speech.\u201d</p><p> French takes as much abuse on social media (specifically Twitter) as anyone I observe. But while he acknowledges those platforms \u201cput human nature on blast,\u201d and not in a good way, he said they\u2019re not the root cause of these problems.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s as old as the high school cafeteria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s peer pressure.\u201d</p><p> As in that context, the answer to political correctness is to stand up to the peer pressure rather than conform to it to stay with the \u201cin\u201d crowd.</p><p> Contrary to some pleas, however, he isn\u2019t for treating big tech companies such as Facebook and Google as public utilities or using antitrust power to break them up.</p><p> \u201cIf you have one \u2018woke\u2019 Google and you break into nine pieces, what are you going to have?\u201d he posited. \u201cNine \u2018woke\u2019 Googles.\u201d</p><p> The answer here is a mix of persuading the leaders of these behemoths not to stifle speech they don\u2019t like and encouraging entrepreneurs who want to compete with them. The worst approach would be to weaken that strong legal environment for free speech and to let government regulators decide what\u2019s OK to say.</p><p> \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know about politics,\u201d he warned those who have the upper hand today, \u201cit\u2019s that no party maintains control for long.\u201d</p><p> (Kyle Wingfield is president and CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.georgiapolicy.org\">www.georgiapolicy.org</url>.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-173BACAE298EE74B</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28974FED71FC6A NWBKGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W72-NVW1-JBCN-4279-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Community Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Perhaps the most famous of all is the claim of the renowned economist Irving Fisher that \"stock prices have reached a permanently high plateau\" just before the 1929 crash. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent boom in stock prices worldwide has taken markets into nosebleed territory. That means equities have, in lots of cases, reached valuation levels that, in the past, have typically suggested one thing: sooner or later, we will see a big fall. </p><p>On cue, we see numerous explanations advanced as to why things might be different this time. One idea is based on the observation that firms don't invest so much these days in plant, machinery or buildings. Old-fashioned concepts of capital fail to encompass the fact that much economic activity today is \"weightless\": businesses are all about idea generation that leads to an accumulation of intangible capital. Hence, the old rules about equity valuation don't apply.</p><p>The big tech companies today, for instance, have valuations many times the total worth of the physical stuff they own. Most of the worth of Google, Facebook and Apple is tied up in the value of computer code and the knowledge carried around in the heads of their employees. How do we measure that? Nobody really has a clue. The stock market has an answer: it's worth more. More than yesterday, at least.</p><p>A related idea focuses on the slightly arcane accounting topic of depreciation. Historically, accountants take what a firm invests and devalues it through time: depreciation reduces the worth of a company as equipment wears out. </p><h>Intangible capital </h><p>What could be different this time is that depreciation no longer works like that for many knowledge-intensive firms, those with large amounts of intangible capital. Perhaps that knowledge retains its value or even increases through time - a kind of negative depreciation that boosts rather than detracts from profits. Modern accounting practices are nowhere near up to speed measuring this kind of thing. Maybe the stock market is ahead of the accountants.  </p><p>One thing that is certainly different is the level of profitability of many firms around the world. Equity markets were, as usual, the first to notice that the world economy is booming. And profits have broadly followed suit. </p><p>At the end of 2016, when most forecasters were pretty gloomy about prospects everywhere US profits, for instance, started to take off. The most recent numbers suggest that US corporations are growing their bottom lines at a 15-20 per cent clip. </p><p>Analysts have fallen over themselves to catch up and now expect profits at the end of this year to be up 25-30 per cent compared with the end of 2017. </p><p>That kind of profits growth ties the Davos crowd up in knots. While personally enriched by higher equity prices, they also know that the corollary is stagnant wages. Much virtue signalling has been the result but little has emerged about what could be done about this. </p><h>'Robin Hood' levy </h><p>UK shadow chancellor John McDonnell - a self-described Marxist - turned up this week at the Swiss ski resort to point out that the rising tide is far from lifting all boats and that he would be putting taxes up as a result. One tax he promised is a \"Robin Hood\" levy on financial transactions. Winston Churchill, no socialist, once opined that he wished he could make \"finance less proud\". I suspect McDonnell will have as much success with his project as did Churchill.  </p><p>If profits continue to grow, taxed or otherwise, at anything like the current rate currently (let alone at the rates forecast by analysts), it will be further evidence that something is really different this time. Historically, company earnings ebb and flow with the business cycle but tend, over time, to track economic growth. Nowadays it seems that corporates have discovered financial alchemy: earnings that grow way in excess of GDP.</p><p>One day something will come along to derail the markets. The list of usual suspects can be rounded up <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Casablanca</emphasis>-style: Trump; Brexit; North Korea; and the lack of any impetus to tighten up on financial regulation. </p><p>The profits renaissance coincided with the election of Trump. Markets worried for a while about his promised trade war but then cheerfully assumed it was all hot air. </p><p>The recent weaponisation of the US dollar could be the start of that trade war in an unexpected form. The Trump administration's successful devaluation of the dollar is playing with fire. If it continues, it has the capacity to ignite the next crisis. That's not to forecast one, but trouble is certainly brewing in the currency markets. </p><p>Excess profits are at the heart of populism. They can be brought down by recession, competition, taxation or pitchforks. It will be interesting to see which mechanism prevails.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3371922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RHJ-5VV1-JC8Y-83HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CECC</classCode><className>STOCK MARKET CRASHES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000482</classCode><className>DEVALUATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CECC</classCode><className>STOCK MARKET CRASHES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000482</classCode><className>DEVALUATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N541211GM</classCode><className>ACCOUNTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It also cautioned against making changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.'[I]nstead of seeking to hold digital platforms liable for content posted by their users, regulators and advocates should instead focus on holding companies accountable for how content is amplified and targeted,' RDR argued in its report. </p><p>'It's not just the content, but tech companies' surveillance-based business models that are distorting the public sphere and threatening democracy.'In a recent speech, however, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen asked if Big Tech should get full statutory immunity[7] for 'removing lawful speech and given carte blanche as a censor if the content that is not 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, or harassing' under [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act].'Rosen briefly summarized Section 230 as applied to a social media site as follows: 'Under Section 230, the social media site is not liable for what the user says, although the user themselves may still be liable. Section 230 also immunizes a website from some liability for 'in good faith' removing illicit user-generated content that is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.'' The RDR report recommended federal legislators consider requiring online platforms do the following, according to Axios[8]: '[P]ublish their rules for what content and targeted advertising they allow; issue reports on the content and ads they take down for breaking the rules; and explain the algorithms that determine what ends up on someone's screen.' ''This kind of transparency is not the end goal,'' said Nathalie Marchal, one of the authors, reported Axios. ''This kind of transparency is a necessary first step toward accountability.''U.S. Attorney General William Barr took a different tack during his introductory statement to the recent Department of Justice Section 230 Workshop.'No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,' said Barr on Feb. 19[9]. 'They have become titans of U.S. industry.' This boom has left consumers with less options, said the attorney general.'The lack of feasible alternatives is relevant in the Section 230 discussion -- both for those citizens who want safer online spaces and for those whose speech has been banned or restricted by these platforms,' he said[10]. Barr also said that due to the rise of algorithms, content moderation, and recommendations, the lines between 'passively hosting third-party speech and actively curating or promoting speech' were blurred.Indeed, Rosen pointed out the Good Samaritan provision of Section 230 in his recent speech[11], noting that 'platforms have the ability to remove content that they have a 'good faith' belief is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.''But he also made clear one distinction: that Big Tech lacks oversight and has been given 'a blank check, ignoring the 'good faith' requirement and relying on the broad term 'otherwise objectionable' as carte blanche to selectively remove anything from websites for other reasons and still claim immunity.'MRC TechWatch Senior Analyst Corinne Weaver and MRC TechWatch Contributing Writer Alexander Hall contributed to this report.

It also cautioned against making changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.'[I]nstead of seeking to hold digital platforms liable for content posted by their users, regulators and advocates should instead focus on holding companies accountable for how content is amplified and targeted,' RDR argued in its report. </p><p>'It's not just the content, but tech companies' surveillance-based business models that are distorting the public sphere and threatening democracy.'In a recent speech, however, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen asked if Big Tech should get full statutory immunity[7] for 'removing lawful speech and given carte blanche as a censor if the content that is not 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, or harassing' under [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act].'Rosen briefly summarized Section 230 as applied to a social media site as follows: 'Under Section 230, the social media site is not liable for what the user says, although the user themselves may still be liable. Section 230 also immunizes a website from some liability for 'in good faith' removing illicit user-generated content that is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.'' The RDR report recommended federal legislators consider requiring online platforms do the following, according to Axios[8]: '[P]ublish their rules for what content and targeted advertising they allow; issue reports on the content and ads they take down for breaking the rules; and explain the algorithms that determine what ends up on someone's screen.' '#8216;This kind of transparency is not the end goal,'' said Nathalie Marchal, one of the authors, reported Axios. '#8216;This kind of transparency is a necessary first step toward accountability.''U.S. Attorney General William Barr took a different tack during his introductory statement to the recent Department of Justice Section 230 Workshop.'No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,' said Barr on Feb. 19[9]. 'They have become titans of U.S. industry.' This boom has left consumers with less options, said the attorney general.'The lack of feasible alternatives is relevant in the Section 230 discussion -- both for those citizens who want safer online spaces and for those whose speech has been banned or restricted by these platforms,' he said[10]. Barr also said that due to the rise of algorithms, content moderation, and recommendations, the lines between 'passively hosting third-party speech and actively curating or promoting speech' were blurred.Indeed, Rosen pointed out the Good Samaritan provision of Section 230 in his recent speech[11], noting that 'platforms have the ability to remove content that they have a 'good faith' belief is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.''But he also made clear one distinction: that Big Tech lacks oversight and has been given 'a blank check, ignoring the 'good faith' requirement and relying on the broad term 'otherwise objectionable' as carte blanche to selectively remove anything from websites for other reasons and still claim immunity.'MRC TechWatch Senior Analyst Corinne Weaver and MRC TechWatch Contributing Writer Alexander Hall contributed to this report.

But investors are suddenly worried about increased regulations in the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica user data scandal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of these big five techs -- as well as the Nasdaq and broader market -- have all fallen. But Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet have been hit particularly hard. Each of them has plunged more than 10% in the past week and a half.</p><p>Is it an overreaction? </p><p>Analysts expect most Big Tech companies to post strong results this quarter and for the rest of this year. Experts say that the Big Tech stocks should eventually bounce back once investors remember how strong their earnings, sales and balance sheets are. Most of these companies are loaded with cash.</p><p>Yet there are legitimate concerns about whether politics will trump fundamentals. </p><p>If there is a crackdown on how Facebook, Google and Twitter (another insanely volatile stock lately) run their businesses, advertisers could flee as a result. And Trump supposedly is considering a change in tax laws or tougher antitrust laws against Amazon, which could hurt its business.</p><p>Washington probably won't let up. Mark Zuckerberg is coming to testify before Congress next month, and stricter internet privacy policies could come after that. That could make tech stocks risky bets for awhile.</p><p>\"The fundamentals are still positive and there is global growth. This is a good buying opportunity for the longer-term investor,\" said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments. \"But this regulatory overhang will be with the FAANG stocks for the next few months.\"</p><p>Wall Street is also worried about how much top tech companies weigh on the broader market. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook accounted for more than 25% of the weighting in the S&amp;P 500 at the end of February. </p><p>The last time tech was such a big component of the overall index was during the final stages of the tech stock mania on Wall Street nearly twenty years ago. Schulze thinks it's unfair to compare 2018 to 1999 though.</p><p>\"This is not the dot com bubble of the late 1990s where there was hot money trading themes and ideas,\" he said. \"Major businesses in tech now have already been developed. There are real earnings and cash flow.\"</p><p>That may be true. But a company can have solid fundamentals and still be too expensive.</p><p>\"These are obviously really good companies with strong business models but valuations weren't even being discussed. It was more of a momentum move,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management .</p><p>\"So much money was being put into tech. This was more overdue than overdone,\" Kuby said. </p><p>Kuby isn't shunning tech necessarily though. His firm owns shares of Alphabet because he thinks it's a relatively good value compared to Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. </p><p>He also owns chip companies AMD and Qualcomm, which he thinks have been unfairly punished in the recent tech selloff. </p><p>Qualcomm in particular has been hit hard because of the drama associated with rival Broadcom's hostile attempt to buy it. The Trump administration blocked the takeover, citing national security issues since Broadcom is based in Singapore.</p><p>Kuby is more bullish on stable companies that have fallen out of favor but could offer more solid returns if the market volatility continues and the broader economy loses steam as well. He likes Kraft Heinz and drug store giants CVS and Walgreens. </p><p>But even if the Nasdaq continues to slide, tech may not bring down the overall market. Several non-techs in the Dow, most notably Boeing and Nike, are still enjoying solid gains this year. </p><p>Older techs have thrived as well. Cisco, Intel and Microsoft are among the top Dow performers in 2018.</p><p>But one thing seems certain. It looks like volatility is here to stay and that is largely due to the fast and furious pace of headlines about the top techs. Traders are making quick bets to try and profit from the rapid moves -- up and down -- in these stocks.</p><p>\"This is a big opportunity for day traders to profit off the movement for tech stocks on the long and short side. There has been a huge uptick in trading lately -- especially for tech stocks,\" said John Bartleman, president of brokerage firm TradeStation.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But investors are suddenly worried about increased regulations in the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica user data scandal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of these big five techs -- as well as the Nasdaq and broader market -- have all fallen. But Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet have been hit particularly hard. Each of them has plunged more than 10% in the past week and a half.</p><p>Is it an overreaction?</p><p>Analysts expect most Big Tech companies to post strong results this quarter and for the rest of this year. Experts say that the Big Tech stocks should eventually bounce back once investors remember how strong their earnings, sales and balance sheets are. Most of these companies are loaded with cash.</p><p>Yet there are legitimate concerns about whether politics will trump fundamentals.</p><p>If there is a crackdown on how Facebook, Google and Twitter (another insanely volatile stock lately) run their businesses, advertisers could flee as a result. And Trump supposedly is considering a change in tax laws or tougher antitrust laws against Amazon, which could hurt its business.</p><p/><p>Washington probably won't let up. Mark Zuckerberg is coming to testify before Congress next month, and stricter internet privacy policies could come after that. That could make tech stocks risky bets for awhile.</p><p>\"The fundamentals are still positive and there is global growth. This is a good buying opportunity for the longer-term investor,\" said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments. \"But this regulatory overhang will be with the FAANG stocks for the next few months.\"</p><p>Wall Street is also worried about how much top tech companies weigh on the broader market. Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook accounted for more than 25% of the weighting in the S&amp;P 500 at the end of February.</p><p>The last time tech was such a big component of the overall index was during the final stages of the tech stock mania on Wall Street nearly twenty years ago. Schulze thinks it's unfair to compare 2018 to 1999 though.</p><p>\"This is not the dot com bubble of the late 1990s where there was hot money trading themes and ideas,\" he said. \"Major businesses in tech now have already been developed. There are real earnings and cash flow.\"</p><p/><p>That may be true. But a company can have solid fundamentals and still be too expensive.</p><p>\"These are obviously really good companies with strong business models but valuations weren't even being discussed. It was more of a momentum move,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management.</p><p>\"So much money was being put into tech. This was more overdue than overdone,\" Kuby said.</p><p>Kuby isn't shunning tech necessarily though. His firm owns shares of Alphabet because he thinks it's a relatively good value compared to Facebook, Amazon and Netflix.</p><p>He also owns chip companies AMD and Qualcomm, which he thinks have been unfairly punished in the recent tech selloff.</p><p>Qualcomm in particular has been hit hard because of the drama associated with rival Broadcom's hostile attempt to buy it. The Trump administration blocked the takeover, citing national security issues since Broadcom is based in Singapore.</p><p>Kuby is more bullish on stable companies that have fallen out of favor but could offer more solid returns if the market volatility continues and the broader economy loses steam as well. He likes Kraft Heinz and drug store giants CVS and Walgreens.</p><p>But even if the Nasdaq continues to slide, tech may not bring down the overall market. Several non-techs in the Dow, most notably Boeing and Nike, are still enjoying solid gains this year.</p><p>Older techs have thrived as well. Cisco, Intel and Microsoft are among the top Dow performers in 2018.</p><p>But one thing seems certain. It looks like volatility is here to stay and that is largely due to the fast and furious pace of headlines about the top techs. Traders are making quick bets to try and profit from the rapid moves -- up and down -- in these stocks.</p><p>\"This is a big opportunity for day traders to profit off the movement for tech stocks on the long and short side. There has been a huge uptick in trading lately -- especially for tech stocks,\" said John Bartleman, president of brokerage firm TradeStation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180328tech-stocks1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S04-FK81-DY60-K06K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><timeReceived>2:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Kogan used a Facebook app to harvest profile data from not only those who installed the app but their unwitting Facebook friends, too (something no longer possible after Facebook changed its rules in 2014). Some</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\">reports</url></p><p>have suggested that his colleagues thought that what he was doing was unethical; Kogan had an application to use the data for academic purposes rejected in 2015 over concerns about consent.</p><p>As Kogan tells it, he was naive - but not greedy or ethically lax. He says he did not personally gain financially from his Cambridge Analytica deal, but simply wanted more funding to help gather a juicy research database from the world's biggest social network. He had \"no inkling\" anyone would be upset.</p><p>\"All this seems unbelievable and silly now, but from that vantage point it seemed sensible,\" he says. \"I'm a sceptical scientist [but] not a sceptical person.\"</p><p>Neither his manager nor colleagues raised ethical objections to the tie-up, Kogan insists (a Cambridge spokesman said he could not comment as this would constitute personal information). \"The university is very encouraging of its faculty members to go and do entrepreneurial activity,\" partly as a way to hit impact targets in the research excellence framework, he adds.</p><p>Yet Kogan's \"entrepreneurial activity\" culminated in denunciation of the university on the biggest stage possible. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, called before the US Congress after the scandal blew up in April (pictured below), asked \"whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us\".</p><p>Earlier this month, the UK's data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, revealed that it is investigating whether Kogan has committed a criminal offence. It announced that it is to audit the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, where Kogan worked, for compliance with the Data Protection Act. The ICO is also to carry out, with Universities UK, a broader review of academics' use of personal data, in both their research and commercial capacities. And the office has fined Facebook the maximum possible \u00a3500,000 over its part in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In response to Zuckerberg's question, Cambridge</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/notices/news/statement-from-the-university-of-cambridge-about-dr-aleksandr-kogan\">pointed out</url></p><p>that it had worked for years on publicly available research that used Facebook data, including studies co-authored by Facebook employees. Nor is it by any means the only university to establish partnerships with the world's biggest tech firms: earlier this year, for example, France's \u00c9cole Polytechnique announced a new chair in artificial intelligence - funded by Google.</p><p>But the Cambridge Analytica scandal is just one instance of the \"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/01/20/the-techlash-against-amazon-facebook-and-google-and-what-they-can-do\">techlash</url></p><p>\" that many observers consider to be under way against the likes of Google, Facebook, Uber and Amazon. Silicon Valley's finest stand accused of a litany of failings, including providing a platform for Russian interference in foreign elections, monopolistic behaviour, workforce exploitation - and simply making us feel miserable through the relentless interpersonal comparisons facilitated by social media. \"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/theres-blood-in-the-water-in-silicon-valley?utm_term=.iq9EP9nZ8%23.cpGq6eR40\">There's Blood In The Water In Silicon Valley</url></p><p>\" ran one headline on Buzzfeed late last year.</p><p>So should reputation-conscious universities reassess how they work with Big Tech?</p><p>James Williams has worked on both sides of the fence. A former Google advertising strategist, he is now a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford's Oxford Internet Institute. His new book,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stand Out of Our Light</emphasis></p><p>, warns that Silicon Valley's tools of distraction risk undermining our personal and collective will and freedom.</p><p>Williams thinks that researchers and universities that are funded by tech firms, or dependent on their data, are yet to apply the same \"sensitivity\" over conflicts of interest that is normal in, say, pharmaceutical research. \"There is a sexiness to tech companies that's obscured these questions of the power dynamics,\" he says.</p><p>One of the earliest examples of the relationship turning sour came in 2014, with the publication of a</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788\">study</url></p><p>, authored by researchers from Facebook and Cornell University, that involved manipulating the moods of more than 600,000 Facebook users by exposing them to positive or negative emotions. The study, \"Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks\", published in PNAS, constituted a huge experiment on subjects whose consent was not sought, and triggered a major</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jul/01/facebook-cornell-study-emotional-contagion-ethics-breach\">backlash</url></p><p>against Facebook, the university and the journal.</p><p>Kogan, who collaborated with the social network until 2015, says that \"Facebook has data that can answer any question I'm interested in\". But he recalls that the social network became \"increasingly conservative\" about working on academic papers in the wake of the reaction to the PNAS study. \"That paper gave [them] so much negative attention that they clamped down hard on anything being published,\" he says.</p><p>Now, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is introducing further restrictions. Previously, academics could gather anonymous data about user behaviour, but Facebook is \"shutting [that] completely down\", according to Anja Bechmann, an associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, who studies social media and artificial intelligence and is one of dozens of academics to sign a</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://policyreview.info/articles/news/facebook-shuts-gate-after-horse-has-bolted-and-hurts-real-research-process/786\">letter</url></p><p>earlier this year warning that the changes will stymie academic research.</p><p>\"If we want data, we have to work with [Facebook] directly\", Bechmann says. The fear is that \"only the lucky few\" will be permitted to do so: namely, the most prominent scholars from the most famous universities - and primarily those based in the US. Facebook will in effect be able to \"choose the assigned research and research question and team\", she warns.</p><p>This is particularly unfortunate since, as social life has moved online, social media offers a much richer dataset than things such as traditional censuses for social science research, says Bechmann - who has compiled a lengthy list of publications that she says could not have existed without access to social media \"application programming interfaces\" (APIs), which third parties use to glean data from these sites.</p><p>\"It's not good for democracy or our understanding of society that [the public] don't have access to research on [social media] data,\" she says.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to questions from THE.</p><p>The issue of access to data goes wider than social media companies, however. For instance, the race is on in Silicon Valley to create safe, reliable self-driving cars - to which end, companies like Google and Uber have amassed mountains of street-level images and scans from roving test cars in order to teach self-learning artificial intelligence how to deal with every conceivable situation on the road.</p><p>This data - a potential geographer's treasure trove - \"is being held on to very carefully\" by the companies that collect it, says Andrew Moore, dean of Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, despite a recommendation from the Obama administration that it should be made publicly available.</p><p>But in other data-heavy areas, researchers don't need a relationship with a tech company, Moore points out - medical data, say, comes from teaching hospitals. And nine in 10 Carnegie Mellon academics are \"quite satisfied\" with the access they have to big data, he says: \"We get approached very frequently by companies who want us to help them with large amounts of data, as opposed to us going out begging for data and the companies saying no.\"</p><p>But Carnegie Mellon has suffered its own tech-related headaches. In 2015, Uber left Moore's department \"scrambling to recover\" after tempting 40 academics and technicians away with huge salary bumps to form a lab in Pittsburg, The Wall Street Journal</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-uber-a-friend-or-foe-of-carnegie-mellon-in-robotics-1433084582\">reported</url></p><p>. There was a \"tough period of three weeks when we were trying to figure out how we are going to move forward with our research\", Moore said at the time. Defections have continued to occur: earlier this year, for example, the department lost Manuela Veloso, head of machine learning technology, to financial services company JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Stemming this tide of researchers to the tech world has become a big issue for universities, particularly in hyped, lucrative areas like artificial intelligence. It was a key concern of a recent national</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/how-can-universities-compete-tech-giants-ai-talent\">AI\u00a0report</url></p><p>released in France, which recommended - highly optimistically, as one of the authors admitted - doubling the salaries of graduate students in this area to stop them leaving.</p><p>Moore, who himself worked at Google for eight years, describes his job as \"like managing a sports team. You're going to be recruiting many folks, but you don't expect them to stick around forever\". His main strategy for recruitment and retention is to appeal to researchers' idealism. It remains easier, typically, to change society for the better in an academic rather than a corporate position, he says. For instance, computer science researchers at Carnegie Mellon have created an</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/january/detecting-sex-traffickers.html\">online tool</url></p><p>that scans online adverts to detect and identify sex traffickers in the US, facilitating \"almost daily arrests\". That is \"incredibly rewarding\" for the academics behind it, Moore says.</p><p>And while corporate researchers may not have to write government grant proposals, nor do they have access to unlimited resources. \"The sadness is that you see them getting really excited about getting hold of a single intern for three months in the summer - whereas professors get to work with five to 10 graduate students,\" Moore notes.</p><p>Still, in many cases, working for a big tech company can be the best way to get a new tool into the public domain, he admits. \"It's not just the data, but the access to the channels to take an idea and get it released to millions of users. That is very exciting.\"</p><p>Then there is the money question. Last November, The Guardian</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/01/cant-compete-universities-losing-best-ai-scientists\">reported</url></p><p>on fears among AI researchers that \"the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of academia has been bought\" by Silicon Valley. In one case, for instance, Apple convinced a PhD student at Imperial College London to drop their studies for a six-figure salary.</p><p>Nor is that cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me confined to technological fields. Tech firms have also taken to hiring university economists. According to Susan Athey, professor of the economics of technology at Stanford University, this is not only because they want to better understand the complexities of online markets, but also because they feel a need to counter the looming threat of anti-monopoly regulation. \"In-house economists can directly inform regulators and also help outside economic experts learn about the institutional facts, access data and become informed\", Athey has</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/01/27/why-do-technology-companies-hire-economists/\">written</url></p><p>. \"Every week, I am contacted to help fill a position, or I hear about a new hire by firms like Airbnb, Netflix, [music streaming service] Pandora or Uber.\"</p><p>But it remains computer scientists that tech firms most crave. According to Moore, researchers with experience of building autonomous systems - such as robots that can work underground - number in the \"few hundreds\" globally, and are consequently like \"gold dust\" to companies. Moving to a tech company nets such people a compensation package three to five times what they could earn at a university.</p><p>The result is that in a faculty of around 200, Moore loses 10-15 people a year to industry, with only around five coming the other way. This has required him to hire about 50 new academics in the past three years. His point to his recruits is that they should see the revolving door as a plus: \"You can do these round trips,\" he tells them.</p><p>But is a revolving door really a healthy state of affairs?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/opinion/academia-tech-algorithms.html\">Writing</url></p><p>in The New York Times last year, the data scientist Cathy O'Neil warned that one consequence is that \"professors working in computer science and robotics departments - or law schools - often find themselves in situations in which positing any sceptical message about technology could present a professional conflict of interest\". For this reason, academia is \"asleep at the wheel\" when it comes to warning lawmakers about tech's downsides, she added.</p><p>Her article attracted strong rebuttals on social media, particularly from academics in the humanities and social sciences, who pointed to their often robust criticism of tech firms. But Moore admits that the revolving door does indeed create \"somewhat of a conflict of interest\".</p><p>\"I don't think I would ever come out and make statements against a specific company - unless, of course, I knew it was doing something really bad,\" he admits. \"But if a company frustrated me in a particular month, or something like that, it does not make good business sense to moan about it publicly because usually it's part of a bigger relationship.\"</p><p>One option for academics who want to work for tech firms but also want to keep a foot in the academic world, are joint appointments. These have become increasingly common. Amazon's chief economist, Patrick Bajari, is also professor of economics at the University of Washington, for instance. And in 2014, seven academics from Oxford's computer science and engineering departments were recruited to joint positions by DeepMind, a London-based AI company bought by Google in that same year and best known for creating a program capable of beating humans at the board game Go. Three of the academics - including Royal Society fellow Andrew Zisserman, a computer vision expert - remained professors at Oxford. As part of the deal, Google also gave a \"significant seven-figure sum\" to their departments.</p><p>Times Higher Education contacted the three professors for an interview, but a spokeswoman for DeepMind instead provided a statement from Murray Shanahan (pictured left), professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, who is also a researcher at the firm. \"The major incentive for me [in accepting a joint position] was the chance to pursue my research full time without the drain of other academic duties, with access to fabulous resources and in the company of the best like-minded people on the planet,\" Shanahan says.</p><p>That motivation could be compared to that which attracted many academics to the fabled Bell Labs in the US, the corporate laboratory whose researchers won eight Nobel Prizes between 1937 and 2014. But are DeepMind researchers entirely free to choose what they research? The company's spokeswoman says that the company does not \"influence who researchers with dual affiliations collaborate with outside of DeepMind\". But she did not answer questions about whether there are any restrictions on what academics with joint affiliations can publish.</p><p>For his part, Shanahan admits that before he joined DeepMind, he \"considered...the potential loss of freedom and independence I might experience from being part of a big corporation.  Would I still be free to say and do what I liked (for example, to speak to the press) to the extent that I was as a full-time academic?\" But after a year of working for the company, it is a case of \"so far, so good\".</p><p>Moreover, despite being so potentially lucrative for big tech companies, machine learning and artificial intelligence have remained very open fields. Researchers were</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/machine-learning-scientists-protest-nature-moves-field\">up in arms</url></p><p>earlier this year, for instance, when Nature Publishing Group proposed a closed-access journal to serve the discipline. \"The general advantages of being open about research in this area outweigh the potential or perceived advantages of being secretive,\" says Zoubin Ghahramani, a professor of information engineering at Cambridge and chief scientist at Uber (the increasing demands of the latter role requiring him to relocate from Cambridge to San Francisco in August).</p><p>\"Of course, Uber is a company, and so we have to be careful with respect to any commercially sensitive information,\" he says. \"So obviously we wouldn't want to publish our business practices, which other companies might be very interested in, and we have to be careful about other things like IP and so on. But the norm...is in favour of openness.\"</p><p>In the development of self-driving cars, \"very little even in this field is about having a particular secret sauce for something\", he argues. \"It's not like one research paper is going to make a huge difference\" as to whether one company wins the race to build a reliable vehicle.</p><p>But some remain troubled by the potential ethical compromises to which joint appointments could expose academics. This is particularly the case in Germany, where such positions remain hotly contested. The country is keen not to be left behind when it comes to artificial intelligence, and has created a \"Cyber Valley\" near Stuttgart that brings together university researchers and companies. And Martin Stratmann, president of the Max Planck Society, Germany's vast basic research network, explains that it has hired heavily from the US to bring in directors for the Institute for Intelligent Systems, founded in 2011, that constitutes the \"nucleus\" of the project.</p><p>But he is dead set against allowing his academics to work for more than one master. \"In the Max Planck Society...we do not have joint appointments,\" he says. \"We want to define our own rules. We have our own ethics rules. We have our own ethics councils - so we decide where to go.\"</p><p>But others dispute that the ethical strains potentially imposed by joint positions with tech firms are uniquely acute. Uber is currently facing questions over an incident earlier this year in which one of its prototype self-driving cars - carrying a human observer - hit and killed a woman crossing the road in Arizona. So what would Cambridge's Ghahramani do if he felt the company was rushing out a solution before it was safe?</p><p>\"If something didn't match my ethical standards, I would speak out,\" he insists. \"I think this is the role of whistleblowers in any kind of situation.\"</p><p>DeepMind's Shanahan also denies that \"having a joint appointment puts me in a different position to any employee of any company or organisation\". Moreover, he does not expect to be confronted by any particularly serious ethical conflicts in his current role.</p><p>\"One of the reasons I'm comfortable working at DeepMind is that there is a strong ethical ethos to the company,\" he says. \"So I don't anticipate having to face such a moral dilemma.\" l</p><p>Campus, Inc: should universities venture into building businesses?</p><p>When the London tech start-up Magic Pony was sold for a reported $150 million (\u00a3102 million) to Twitter in June 2016, just 18 months after it was created, City investors sat up.</p><p>Admittedly, it wasn't quite the jaw-dropping levels of profit enjoyed by Instagram founder Kevin Systrom, who sold up to Facebook for $1 billion in 2012 after a year of business, but it was further evidence that the UK capital was a growing rival to Silicon Valley for machine learning (Magic Pony uses neural networks to enhance images), following the sale of predictive text company SwiftKey to Microsoft for \u00a3174 million months earlier and DeepMind to Google for \u00a3400 million in 2014.</p><p>While Magic Pony's founders, Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang, were graduates of Imperial College London, they did not fit the familiar \"university pals strike it rich\" narrative of Google or Facebook. They met at Entrepreneur First, a business incubator based in south London that seeks to bring together the brightest minds to see if they can come up with businesses that will fly.</p><p>\"It's a pretty unique model,\" believes Joe White, the company's chief financial officer, who joined in 2016 having sold Moonfruit, the website building company he co-founded just after graduating from the University of Cambridge, for $40 million in 2014.</p><p>\"We're sometimes conflated with traditional incubators as our output is similar. The difference is that we bring people together pre-team, pre-idea,\" White explains. The 100 recruits in each cohort are offered a \u00a32,000-a-month stipend for their first three months, as they set up their companies and develop investment pitches. The 20 or so businesses that look the most promising are then given \u00a380,000 and a further three months of support - including mentoring from successful entrepreneurs and introductions to potential investors and customers - in return for an 8 per cent stake.</p><p>Recruits are typically in their mid- to late twenties, and are often PhD students or postdocs. \"They have to have an edge,\" explains White, and \"a deep specialist knowledge\" is an obvious example of one. A recent team, for instance, paired a graduate of a PhD in black holes with someone from the finance world to create an AI financial adviser.</p><p>That company has already attracted \u00a31.6 million in venture capital investment. And with 10 London and three Singapore cohorts now complete, Entrepreneur First has developed companies with a total combined value of \u00a31.5 billion, which have raised more than \u00a3300 million from venture capitalists, White says.</p><p>Yet the company's heavy reliance on university talent raises the question of whether this is the type of thing UK universities and business schools should be doing themselves. Could such a blurring of the university and tech worlds be one way for them to maintain a connection with their most promising early career researchers in computer science, while also tapping into the vast amounts of money to be made in the tech world?</p><p>White demurs. \"Universities, like many industries, get good at doing a certain thing. They are very good at educating and producing world-class research, [but] the venture capital world is at odds with this environment, so having these things operating beside each other is very difficult.\"</p><p>For him, universities should confine their involvement with the tech world to investing some of their endowments in it. He cites Stanford University's lucrative investment in Sequoia Capital, early investors in PayPal, Google and WhatsApp - although he concedes that few UK universities have remotely comparable amounts of capital to play with.</p><p>White also cautions against universities' preference for what he calls the \"intellectual property bear hug\", whereby they \"grab hold of anything that looks promising\", taking large ownership stakes in the spin-off company and thereby \"stifling\" its further growth. In a recent example, a nascent tech company struggled to win seed funding because the PhD student who ran it had given up a 50 per cent share to his institution. The investment was secured only after the university reduced its share to 10 per cent.</p><p>\"[The PhD student] was a researcher, not an entrepreneur, so didn't understand the deal at the time,\" White says. \"But it meant his idea wasn't going to get off the ground - investors won't back something if so much has been given away.

David Matthews reports</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aleksandr Kogan knows all too well how a tie-up between academia and the tech world can go very, very wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He is the University of Cambridge neuroscientist who earlier this year achieved international infamy for passing on Facebook profile data from tens of millions of users to the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political consultancy accused of using this information to target potential Donald Trump voters in the 2016 US presidential election (something the firm has denied).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now living in New York and working on a new online survey tool, Kogan (pictured right) acknowledges that the bad publicity has in effect ended his academic career. \"I completely missed how people were going to react,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For some, this might sound like just deserts. Kogan used a Facebook app to harvest profile data from not only those who installed the app but their unwitting Facebook friends, too (something no longer possible after Facebook changed its rules in 2014). Some</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\">reports</url></p><p>have suggested that his colleagues thought that what he was doing was unethical; Kogan had an application to use the data for academic purposes rejected in 2015 over concerns about consent.</p><p>As Kogan tells it, he was naive - but not greedy or ethically lax. He says he did not personally gain financially from his Cambridge Analytica deal, but simply wanted more funding to help gather a juicy research database from the world's biggest social network. He had \"no inkling\" anyone would be upset.</p><p>\"All this seems unbelievable and silly now, but from that vantage point it seemed sensible,\" he says. \"I'm a sceptical scientist [but] not a sceptical person.\"</p><p>Neither his manager nor colleagues raised ethical objections to the tie-up, Kogan insists (a Cambridge spokesman said he could not comment as this would constitute personal information). \"The university is very encouraging of its faculty members to go and do entrepreneurial activity,\" partly as a way to hit impact targets in the research excellence framework, he adds.</p><p>Yet Kogan's \"entrepreneurial activity\" culminated in denunciation of the university on the biggest stage possible. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, called before the US Congress after the scandal blew up in April (pictured below), asked \"whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us\".</p><p>Earlier this month, the UK's data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, revealed that it is investigating whether Kogan has committed a criminal offence. It announced that it is to audit the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, where Kogan worked, for compliance with the Data Protection Act. The ICO is also to carry out, with Universities UK, a broader review of academics' use of personal data, in both their research and commercial capacities. And the office has fined Facebook the maximum possible \u00a3500,000 over its part in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In response to Zuckerberg's question, Cambridge</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/notices/news/statement-from-the-university-of-cambridge-about-dr-aleksandr-kogan\">pointed out</url></p><p>that it had worked for years on publicly available research that used Facebook data, including studies co-authored by Facebook employees. Nor is it by any means the only university to establish partnerships with the world's biggest tech firms: earlier this year, for example, France's \u00c9cole Polytechnique announced a new chair in artificial intelligence - funded by Google.</p><p>But the Cambridge Analytica scandal is just one instance of the \"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/01/20/the-techlash-against-amazon-facebook-and-google-and-what-they-can-do\">techlash</url></p><p>\" that many observers consider to be under way against the likes of Google, Facebook, Uber and Amazon. Silicon Valley's finest stand accused of a litany of failings, including providing a platform for Russian interference in foreign elections, monopolistic behaviour, workforce exploitation - and simply making us feel miserable through the relentless interpersonal comparisons facilitated by social media. \"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/theres-blood-in-the-water-in-silicon-valley?utm_term=.iq9EP9nZ8%23.cpGq6eR40\">There's Blood In The Water In Silicon Valley</url></p><p>\" ran one headline on Buzzfeed late last year.</p><p>So should reputation-conscious universities reassess how they work with Big Tech?</p><p>James Williams has worked on both sides of the fence. A former Google advertising strategist, he is now a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford's Oxford Internet Institute. His new book,</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stand Out of Our Light</emphasis></p><p>, warns that Silicon Valley's tools of distraction risk undermining our personal and collective will and freedom.</p><p>Williams thinks that researchers and universities that are funded by tech firms, or dependent on their data, are yet to apply the same \"sensitivity\" over conflicts of interest that is normal in, say, pharmaceutical research. \"There is a sexiness to tech companies that's obscured these questions of the power dynamics,\" he says.</p><p>One of the earliest examples of the relationship turning sour came in 2014, with the publication of a</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788\">study</url></p><p>, authored by researchers from Facebook and Cornell University, that involved manipulating the moods of more than 600,000 Facebook users by exposing them to positive or negative emotions. The study, \"Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks\", published in PNAS, constituted a huge experiment on subjects whose consent was not sought, and triggered a major</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jul/01/facebook-cornell-study-emotional-contagion-ethics-breach\">backlash</url></p><p>against Facebook, the university and the journal.</p><p>Kogan, who collaborated with the social network until 2015, says that \"Facebook has data that can answer any question I'm interested in\". But he recalls that the social network became \"increasingly conservative\" about working on academic papers in the wake of the reaction to the PNAS study. \"That paper gave [them] so much negative attention that they clamped down hard on anything being published,\" he says.</p><p>Now, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is introducing further restrictions. Previously, academics could gather anonymous data about user behaviour, but Facebook is \"shutting [that] completely down\", according to Anja Bechmann, an associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, who studies social media and artificial intelligence and is one of dozens of academics to sign a</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://policyreview.info/articles/news/facebook-shuts-gate-after-horse-has-bolted-and-hurts-real-research-process/786\">letter</url></p><p>earlier this year warning that the changes will stymie academic research.</p><p>\"If we want data, we have to work with [Facebook] directly\", Bechmann says. The fear is that \"only the lucky few\" will be permitted to do so: namely, the most prominent scholars from the most famous universities - and primarily those based in the US. Facebook will in effect be able to \"choose the assigned research and research question and team\", she warns.</p><p>This is particularly unfortunate since, as social life has moved online, social media offers a much richer dataset than things such as traditional censuses for social science research, says Bechmann - who has compiled a lengthy list of publications that she says could not have existed without access to social media \"application programming interfaces\" (APIs), which third parties use to glean data from these sites.</p><p>\"It's not good for democracy or our understanding of society that [the public] don't have access to research on [social media] data,\" she says.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to questions from THE.</p><p>The issue of access to data goes wider than social media companies, however. For instance, the race is on in Silicon Valley to create safe, reliable self-driving cars - to which end, companies like Google and Uber have amassed mountains of street-level images and scans from roving test cars in order to teach self-learning artificial intelligence how to deal with every conceivable situation on the road.</p><p>This data - a potential geographer's treasure trove - \"is being held on to very carefully\" by the companies that collect it, says Andrew Moore, dean of Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, despite a recommendation from the Obama administration that it should be made publicly available.</p><p>But in other data-heavy areas, researchers don't need a relationship with a tech company, Moore points out - medical data, say, comes from teaching hospitals. And nine in 10 Carnegie Mellon academics are \"quite satisfied\" with the access they have to big data, he says: \"We get approached very frequently by companies who want us to help them with large amounts of data, as opposed to us going out begging for data and the companies saying no.\"</p><p>But Carnegie Mellon has suffered its own tech-related headaches. In 2015, Uber left Moore's department \"scrambling to recover\" after tempting 40 academics and technicians away with huge salary bumps to form a lab in Pittsburg, The Wall Street Journal</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-uber-a-friend-or-foe-of-carnegie-mellon-in-robotics-1433084582\">reported</url></p><p>. There was a \"tough period of three weeks when we were trying to figure out how we are going to move forward with our research\", Moore said at the time. Defections have continued to occur: earlier this year, for example, the department lost Manuela Veloso, head of machine learning technology, to financial services company JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Stemming this tide of researchers to the tech world has become a big issue for universities, particularly in hyped, lucrative areas like artificial intelligence. It was a key concern of a recent national</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/how-can-universities-compete-tech-giants-ai-talent\">AI\u00a0report</url></p><p>released in France, which recommended - highly optimistically, as one of the authors admitted - doubling the salaries of graduate students in this area to stop them leaving.</p><p>Moore, who himself worked at Google for eight years, describes his job as \"like managing a sports team. You're going to be recruiting many folks, but you don't expect them to stick around forever\". His main strategy for recruitment and retention is to appeal to researchers' idealism. It remains easier, typically, to change society for the better in an academic rather than a corporate position, he says. For instance, computer science researchers at Carnegie Mellon have created an</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/january/detecting-sex-traffickers.html\">online tool</url></p><p>that scans online adverts to detect and identify sex traffickers in the US, facilitating \"almost daily arrests\". That is \"incredibly rewarding\" for the academics behind it, Moore says.</p><p>And while corporate researchers may not have to write government grant proposals, nor do they have access to unlimited resources. \"The sadness is that you see them getting really excited about getting hold of a single intern for three months in the summer - whereas professors get to work with five to 10 graduate students,\" Moore notes.</p><p>Still, in many cases, working for a big tech company can be the best way to get a new tool into the public domain, he admits. \"It's not just the data, but the access to the channels to take an idea and get it released to millions of users. That is very exciting.\"</p><p>Then there is the money question. Last November, The Guardian</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/01/cant-compete-universities-losing-best-ai-scientists\">reported</url></p><p>on fears among AI researchers that \"the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of academia has been bought\" by Silicon Valley. In one case, for instance, Apple convinced a PhD student at Imperial College London to drop their studies for a six-figure salary.</p><p>Nor is that cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me confined to technological fields. Tech firms have also taken to hiring university economists. According to Susan Athey, professor of the economics of technology at Stanford University, this is not only because they want to better understand the complexities of online markets, but also because they feel a need to counter the looming threat of anti-monopoly regulation. \"In-house economists can directly inform regulators and also help outside economic experts learn about the institutional facts, access data and become informed\", Athey has</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/01/27/why-do-technology-companies-hire-economists/\">written</url></p><p>. \"Every week, I am contacted to help fill a position, or I hear about a new hire by firms like Airbnb, Netflix, [music streaming service] Pandora or Uber.\"</p><p>But it remains computer scientists that tech firms most crave. According to Moore, researchers with experience of building autonomous systems - such as robots that can work underground - number in the \"few hundreds\" globally, and are consequently like \"gold dust\" to companies. Moving to a tech company nets such people a compensation package three to five times what they could earn at a university.</p><p>The result is that in a faculty of around 200, Moore loses 10-15 people a year to industry, with only around five coming the other way. This has required him to hire about 50 new academics in the past three years. His point to his recruits is that they should see the revolving door as a plus: \"You can do these round trips,\" he tells them.</p><p>But is a revolving door really a healthy state of affairs?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/opinion/academia-tech-algorithms.html\">Writing</url></p><p>in The New York Times last year, the data scientist Cathy O'Neil warned that one consequence is that \"professors working in computer science and robotics departments - or law schools - often find themselves in situations in which positing any sceptical message about technology could present a professional conflict of interest\". For this reason, academia is \"asleep at the wheel\" when it comes to warning lawmakers about tech's downsides, she added.</p><p>Her article attracted strong rebuttals on social media, particularly from academics in the humanities and social sciences, who pointed to their often robust criticism of tech firms. But Moore admits that the revolving door does indeed create \"somewhat of a conflict of interest\".</p><p>\"I don't think I would ever come out and make statements against a specific company - unless, of course, I knew it was doing something really bad,\" he admits. \"But if a company frustrated me in a particular month, or something like that, it does not make good business sense to moan about it publicly because usually it's part of a bigger relationship.\"</p><p>One option for academics who want to work for tech firms but also want to keep a foot in the academic world, are joint appointments. These have become increasingly common. Amazon's chief economist, Patrick Bajari, is also professor of economics at the University of Washington, for instance. And in 2014, seven academics from Oxford's computer science and engineering departments were recruited to joint positions by DeepMind, a London-based AI company bought by Google in that same year and best known for creating a program capable of beating humans at the board game Go. Three of the academics - including Royal Society fellow Andrew Zisserman, a computer vision expert - remained professors at Oxford. As part of the deal, Google also gave a \"significant seven-figure sum\" to their departments.</p><p>Times Higher Education contacted the three professors for an interview, but a spokeswoman for DeepMind instead provided a statement from Murray Shanahan (pictured left), professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, who is also a researcher at the firm. \"The major incentive for me [in accepting a joint position] was the chance to pursue my research full time without the drain of other academic duties, with access to fabulous resources and in the company of the best like-minded people on the planet,\" Shanahan says.</p><p>That motivation could be compared to that which attracted many academics to the fabled Bell Labs in the US, the corporate laboratory whose researchers won eight Nobel Prizes between 1937 and 2014. But are DeepMind researchers entirely free to choose what they research? The company's spokeswoman says that the company does not \"influence who researchers with dual affiliations collaborate with outside of DeepMind\". But she did not answer questions about whether there are any restrictions on what academics with joint affiliations can publish.</p><p>For his part, Shanahan admits that before he joined DeepMind, he \"considered...the potential loss of freedom and independence I might experience from being part of a big corporation.  Would I still be free to say and do what I liked (for example, to speak to the press) to the extent that I was as a full-time academic?\" But after a year of working for the company, it is a case of \"so far, so good\".</p><p>Moreover, despite being so potentially lucrative for big tech companies, machine learning and artificial intelligence have remained very open fields. Researchers were</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/machine-learning-scientists-protest-nature-moves-field\">up in arms</url></p><p>earlier this year, for instance, when Nature Publishing Group proposed a closed-access journal to serve the discipline. \"The general advantages of being open about research in this area outweigh the potential or perceived advantages of being secretive,\" says Zoubin Ghahramani, a professor of information engineering at Cambridge and chief scientist at Uber (the increasing demands of the latter role requiring him to relocate from Cambridge to San Francisco in August).</p><p>\"Of course, Uber is a company, and so we have to be careful with respect to any commercially sensitive information,\" he says. \"So obviously we wouldn't want to publish our business practices, which other companies might be very interested in, and we have to be careful about other things like IP and so on. But the norm...is in favour of openness.\"</p><p>In the development of self-driving cars, \"very little even in this field is about having a particular secret sauce for something\", he argues. \"It's not like one research paper is going to make a huge difference\" as to whether one company wins the race to build a reliable vehicle.</p><p>But some remain troubled by the potential ethical compromises to which joint appointments could expose academics. This is particularly the case in Germany, where such positions remain hotly contested. The country is keen not to be left behind when it comes to artificial intelligence, and has created a \"Cyber Valley\" near Stuttgart that brings together university researchers and companies. And Martin Stratmann, president of the Max Planck Society, Germany's vast basic research network, explains that it has hired heavily from the US to bring in directors for the Institute for Intelligent Systems, founded in 2011, that constitutes the \"nucleus\" of the project.</p><p>But he is dead set against allowing his academics to work for more than one master. \"In the Max Planck Society...we do not have joint appointments,\" he says. \"We want to define our own rules. We have our own ethics rules. We have our own ethics councils - so we decide where to go.\"</p><p>But others dispute that the ethical strains potentially imposed by joint positions with tech firms are uniquely acute. Uber is currently facing questions over an incident earlier this year in which one of its prototype self-driving cars - carrying a human observer - hit and killed a woman crossing the road in Arizona. So what would Cambridge's Ghahramani do if he felt the company was rushing out a solution before it was safe?</p><p>\"If something didn't match my ethical standards, I would speak out,\" he insists. \"I think this is the role of whistleblowers in any kind of situation.\"</p><p>DeepMind's Shanahan also denies that \"having a joint appointment puts me in a different position to any employee of any company or organisation\". Moreover, he does not expect to be confronted by any particularly serious ethical conflicts in his current role.</p><p>\"One of the reasons I'm comfortable working at DeepMind is that there is a strong ethical ethos to the company,\" he says. \"So I don't anticipate having to face such a moral dilemma.\" l</p><p>Campus, Inc: should universities venture into building businesses?</p><p>When the London tech start-up Magic Pony was sold for a reported $150 million (\u00a3102 million) to Twitter in June 2016, just 18 months after it was created, City investors sat up.</p><p>Admittedly, it wasn't quite the jaw-dropping levels of profit enjoyed by Instagram founder Kevin Systrom, who sold up to Facebook for $1 billion in 2012 after a year of business, but it was further evidence that the UK capital was a growing rival to Silicon Valley for machine learning (Magic Pony uses neural networks to enhance images), following the sale of predictive text company SwiftKey to Microsoft for \u00a3174 million months earlier and DeepMind to Google for \u00a3400 million in 2014.</p><p>While Magic Pony's founders, Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang, were graduates of Imperial College London, they did not fit the familiar \"university pals strike it rich\" narrative of Google or Facebook. They met at Entrepreneur First, a business incubator based in south London that seeks to bring together the brightest minds to see if they can come up with businesses that will fly.</p><p>\"It's a pretty unique model,\" believes Joe White, the company's chief financial officer, who joined in 2016 having sold Moonfruit, the website building company he co-founded just after graduating from the University of Cambridge, for $40 million in 2014.</p><p>\"We're sometimes conflated with traditional incubators as our output is similar. The difference is that we bring people together pre-team, pre-idea,\" White explains. The 100 recruits in each cohort are offered a \u00a32,000-a-month stipend for their first three months, as they set up their companies and develop investment pitches. The 20 or so businesses that look the most promising are then given \u00a380,000 and a further three months of support - including mentoring from successful entrepreneurs and introductions to potential investors and customers - in return for an 8 per cent stake.</p><p>Recruits are typically in their mid- to late twenties, and are often PhD students or postdocs. \"They have to have an edge,\" explains White, and \"a deep specialist knowledge\" is an obvious example of one. A recent team, for instance, paired a graduate of a PhD in black holes with someone from the finance world to create an AI financial adviser.</p><p>That company has already attracted \u00a31.6 million in venture capital investment. And with 10 London and three Singapore cohorts now complete, Entrepreneur First has developed companies with a total combined value of \u00a31.5 billion, which have raised more than \u00a3300 million from venture capitalists, White says.</p><p>Yet the company's heavy reliance on university talent raises the question of whether this is the type of thing UK universities and business schools should be doing themselves. Could such a blurring of the university and tech worlds be one way for them to maintain a connection with their most promising early career researchers in computer science, while also tapping into the vast amounts of money to be made in the tech world?</p><p>White demurs. \"Universities, like many industries, get good at doing a certain thing. They are very good at educating and producing world-class research, [but] the venture capital world is at odds with this environment, so having these things operating beside each other is very difficult.\"</p><p>For him, universities should confine their involvement with the tech world to investing some of their endowments in it. He cites Stanford University's lucrative investment in Sequoia Capital, early investors in PayPal, Google and WhatsApp - although he concedes that few UK universities have remotely comparable amounts of capital to play with.</p><p>White also cautions against universities' preference for what he calls the \"intellectual property bear hug\", whereby they \"grab hold of anything that looks promising\", taking large ownership stakes in the spin-off company and thereby \"stifling\" its further growth. In a recent example, a nascent tech company struggled to win seed funding because the PhD student who ran it had given up a 50 per cent share to his institution. The investment was secured only after the university reduced its share to 10 per cent.</p><p>\"[The PhD student] was a researcher, not an entrepreneur, so didn't understand the deal at the time,\" White says. \"But it meant his idea wasn't going to get off the ground - investors won't back something if so much has been given away. [For universities], it's better to have 10 per cent of something that becomes massive, than 50 per cent of not very much at all.\"</p><p>Jack Grove</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIHEDS-5VLQ7S36</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIHEDS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVM-XK71-DYX7-205D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235861</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TSL Education Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times Higher Education Supplement</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33701\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 2366</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coronavirus outbreak has now killed 1,115 people and infected more than 45,170 globally. But the daily increase in cases in China appears to be leveling off, suggesting that the outbreak could be reaching its peak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That trend is allowing global stocks to edge higher. The Shanghai Composite has gained 1.8% this week, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 0.9%. </p><p>\"The number of daily confirmed cases has shown tentative signs of moderating,\" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients Wednesday. \"The global spread has so far been kept relatively under control too, with nearly all confirmed cases in China.\"</p><p>The bank's expectation is that the outbreak \"passes its peak by spring.\" That said, there remain significant risks, especially as 160 million employees in China return to work.</p><p>SoftBank's disappearing profit</p><p>SoftBank made its name through bold bets. Now some of its biggest wagers are dragging the company down, just as it faces new pressure to perform.</p><p>The Japanese tech conglomerate said Wednesday that its profits have been almost entirely wiped out as it continues to feel the pain from big losses in its massive tech fund.</p><p>The numbers: SoftBank reported operating income of 2.59 billion yen ($23.6 million) for the three months ending in December, a plunge of 99% compared to the same period a year earlier, my CNN Business colleague Sherisse Pham reports.</p><p>SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son's closely watched $100 billion Vision Fund was the biggest driver of those losses. The Vision Fund and a related entity reported an operating loss of 225 billion yen ($2 billion) for the quarter. It blamed WeWork and Uber for the hit.</p><p>That poor performance is making it harder for Son and SoftBank to raise money for their next mega tech fund, dubbed Vision Fund 2.</p><p>SoftBank said last year that it expected to raise $108 billion from companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Foxconn and Standard Chartered. But Son said Wednesday that Uber's weak share price and WeWork's failed IPO, which required a bailout from SoftBank, \"have caused concern amongst potential investors.\"</p><p>\"At the moment, I think that our next fund size should be a little bit smaller, because we have caused concerns and anxiety to a lot of people,\" he said.</p><p>Over to New York: Activist investor Elliott Management revealed last week that it had built a substantial stake in SoftBank and wants the company to make changes to improve its performance. These results will bolster Elliott's case.</p><p>Son knows the company needs to do better. He said Wednesday that he believes that SoftBank shares trade at a discount of more than 50% and should be priced at 12,097 yen ($110).</p><p>Some good news: Shares closed up 12% in Tokyo before the earnings after a US judge approved the $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which SoftBank acquired nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal called Sprint \"a major distraction\" that had \"brought little in terms of results.\" In other words: Good riddance.</p><p>Silicon Valley's deals are under the microscope</p><p>US regulators already scrutinized big tech deals like Facebook's purchase of Instagram and Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods. Now the Federal Trade Commission is casting a wider net.</p><p>The agency said Tuesday that it had sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft on all acquisitions they had completed in the past 10 years.</p><p>Details, details: The FTC is looking for information on any deals that didn't need to be reported to antitrust agencies because the dollar value wasn't high enough, my CNN Business colleague Brian Fung reports.</p><p>One example: In the past decade, Facebook cemented its position as the leader in social networking through a mix of major acquisitions --- like its $22 billion purchase of WhatsApp --- and smaller deals for startups like tbh, an app for teens that was subsequently shut down. Facebook did not disclose financial terms for the tbh deal at the time.</p><p>Such deals may have flown under the radar while giving big companies access to valuable data, systems, talent and customers.</p><p>Why it's important: Big Tech's regulatory issues are building. The FTC requests mark a major expansion on the antitrust front following years of practically unchecked growth. The companies also face growing pressure globally over their data practices and handling of harmful online content.</p><p>\"This initiative will enable the Commission to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition,\" FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement.</p><p>Investors react: Facebook's stock fell 2.8% on Tuesday, while Microsoft shares shed 2.3%. Apple was off 0.6%. Shares of Amazon and Google parent Alphabet finished higher.</p><p>Up next</p><p>Heineken, CVS and Molson Coors report results before US markets open.

View original post here[2]. President Trump has made no secret of the fact that he believes tech behemoths like Amazon are anti-competitive, job-killing monstrosities that should be broken up or at least see their influence curbed by regulators. And now, after stocking the FTC with critics of big tech,[3] it appears the committee might be taking the first steps toward breaking up the big tech firms - or at least ensuring that they can't get any bigger.  With the committee still prepping what will reportedly be a \"record breaking fine\" over Facebook's failure to uphold a guarantee[4] to safeguard user data, Bureau of Competition Director Bruce Hoffman and FTC Chairman Joe Simons announced the formation of a new task force that will scrutinize mergers in the tech space - and even review consummated deals. </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition announced the creation of a task force dedicated to monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.  To create the Technology Task Force, the Bureau of Competition will draw upon existing staff and expertise to enhance the Bureau's focus on technology-related sectors of the economy, including markets in which online platforms compete. The creation of this task force is modeled on the FTC's successfulMerger Litigation Task Force, launched in 2002 by then-Bureau of Competition Director Joe Simons. The 2002 task force reinvigorated the Commission's hospital merger review program, and also sharpened the agency's focus on merger enforcement in retail industries, particularly regarding matters involving food, beverages, and supermarkets.  Given the ever-expanding role of technology in the lives of Americans, the committee said it would make sense to ensure any future tie-ups \"ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.\" \"The role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day,\" said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. \"As I've noted in the past, it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition. Our ongoing Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century are a crucial step to deepen our understanding of these markets and potential competitive issues. The Technology Task Force is the next step in that effort.\"  But - and this is key - the commission won't focus solely on proposed deals. Completed mergers might also come under the microscope, something that brings to mind the commission's investigation into Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram. Indeed, Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet are responsible for much of the M...ctivity in Silicon Valley. \"Technology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust enforcement,\" said Bureau Director Bruce Hoffman. \"By centralizing our expertise and attention, the new task force will be able to focus on these markets exclusively - ensuring they are operating pursuant to the antitrust laws, and taking action where they are not.\"  In addition to examining industry practices and conducting law enforcement investigations, the Technology Task Force will, among other things, coordinate and consult with staff throughout the FTC on technology-related matters, including prospective merger reviews in the technology sector and reviews of consummated technology mergers.  The task force will consist of 17 lawyers who willwork to \"identify and investigate potential anticompetitive conduct\". If nothing else, the formation of the task force has certainly put big tech on notice.

The likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have seemed to grow bigger, richer and more powerful every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a flurry of activity this week seems to suggest American regulators and politicians are preparing to take their concerns seriously.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the weekend, reports have emerged suggesting the US Department of Justice is preparing a probe into Google, regulators have spent time divvying up jurisdiction over Silicon Valley's tech giants, and now a congressional committee has launched its own investigation into competition in the digital markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Trade Commission is said to be taking on responsibility for Facebook and Amazon, while the DoJ looks at Apple and Google. The House judicial committee's probe is a bipartisan look at digital markets, with the investigation examining the conduct of tech firms and whether existing regulation is sufficient.</p><p>\"The fact they haven't opened an investigation up to this point in time is shocking,\" said Maurice Stucke, a former justice department lawyer who is now a law professor at the University of Tennessee.</p><p>\"It has been building to a fever pitch of over the last six to 12 months,\" said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University. \"There's general unease these companies have too much power, and it really crosses the political aisle.\"</p><p>The market is certainly spooked. Billions of dollars were wiped from the value of the major tech firms on Monday, with shares in all four companies falling and the tech-heavy Nasdaq entering correction territory.</p><p>The activity marks a sea change in the regulation of Silicon Valley, which until now had been firmly the domain of the EU. The European Competition Commission has been hardest on Google, which has been hit with three fines totalling more than $9bn (\u00a37bn) since 2017, but has also targeted Apple, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Scrutiny of tech firms in the EU has intensified since the bloc introduced strict new privacy rules a year ago, giving data regulators for the first time real teeth and the power to fine companies as much as 4pc of annual sales for the most serious violations.</p><p>Now, the US wants to do something similar in a clear shift from the regulatory situation in 2013, when the Federal Trade Commission closed an investigation without any sanctions or charges. So what has changed? Some analysts are suspicious there is a political motive. Google, a great American success story, is on the face of it not an obvious target for the current administration. The argument against the company, that it fixes search results for its own benefit, is supported by those who want tighter controls on business, but conservatives should, in theory, \"hate\" the idea, says Prof Chris Sagers, of the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.</p><p>\"To antitrust conservatives, that argument, that theory of bad behaviour, basically implies that once you're a monopolist you have a duty to help your own competitors,\" he says.</p><p>\"My basic reaction is either this is being misreported and blown into something that it's not, or it's the government serving some agenda that is unclear, or just trying to get press attention.\" Google, alongside Facebook and Twitter, two other platforms that deal in search and news content, has come under fire from conservatives who perceive it to be demoting their views in favour of liberals. There's a growing feeling that Silicon Valley, based as it is in liberal California and adjacent to super-liberal San Francisco, is an unfriendly place for conservatives.</p><p>President Trump has repeatedly tweeted about this, and the White House has launched an email form asking Americans for their experiences of being kicked off a social media platform.</p><p>Maureen Ohlhausen, former acting chairman and commissioner of the FTC, cautioned that recent revelations that the FTC and DoJ have established which agency can investigate which company does not mean investigations are coming. \"I would be hesitant about this idea that multiple cases are imminent, it doesn't signal enforcement is imminent,\" she says.</p><p>Some of that pressure is coming from the heightened profiles of politicians such as Elizabeth Warren, a long-time antitrust campaigner who is now running for the Democratic nomination for president, who has advocated for the break-up of big tech.</p><p>She repeated that call on Monday, tweeting about her plan. \"Google has too much power, and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else. It's time to fight back,\" she said.</p><p>How likely is that break-up? It's a \"very high bar\", says Ohlhausen. \"The remedy has to be tied to the underlying violation - how do you restore competition?\" Trying to undo Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, a remedy recently suggested by Chris Hughes, a former executive at the social network, would be more troublesome, says Ohlhausen.</p><p>\"I think (the speculation) is becoming more real, but antitrust is not a 24-hour event,\" added Blair Levin, a fellow with the Brookings Institution who served as chief of staff to a federal communications commission chairman.</p><p>The tech companies are unlikely to take any threats to their empires lightly. Responding to Hughes' call, Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs and communications, said breaking up the company would not solve the problem. \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability,\" he said last month. \"But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break-up of a successful American company.\"</p><p>Sagers thinks they will \"come out swinging\", citing the 2013 case in which Google made \"limited\" concessions and had the case dropped.</p><p>Earlier this year the justice department failed in its efforts to undo the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, after a panel of judges handed down a decision that upheld AT&amp;T's arguments and said the government's case was \"unpersuasive\". \"It will make Google more confident that the DoJ suffered a very bruising loss in the courts in the AT&amp;T case,\" he said.</p><p>Yesterday, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said its minority share of global smartphone sales meant it shouldn't attract competition scrutiny.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly,\" he told CBS. \"Our share is much more modest.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, antitrust campaigners say they are \"cautiously optimistic\". \"We look forward to seeing this move translate into meaningful action by the agencies charged with enforcing US law,\" said Open Markets Institute executive director Barry Lynn.</p><p>'The fact they haven't opened an investigation up to this point in time is shocking'</p><p>'I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly'  ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-149878473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8G-1KW1-DYTY-C2VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>RUTGERS UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I had already tagged a Trending Topics article, from EContent's July/ August issue, that talks about how it is affecting content marketing. Then, I came across two related articles in the August/September edition of Database Trends and Applications (DBTA). Sharing a bit from all three pieces seemed like the, uh, intelligent thing to do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've Only Just Begun ...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Joe McKendrick's DBTA article, \"The Artificial Intelligence Journey Has Only Begun,\" he states, \"We're still very much in the early days of artificial intelligence (AI).\" Still, that has not kept companies from investing large sums of money in AI initiatives \"at astounding rates.\" A recent report from the McKinley Global Institute, which McKendrick references throughout, indicates that adopting AI into an organization's systems, applications, and data is happening at a steady pace.</p><p>The report suggests that AI is still in its pioneering stages, both in and out of the tech realm. Only 20% of firms are deploying AI as a core part of their organizational structure. The 3,000-plus C-level executives who took part in the survey are unsure about the business case or how AI will affect ROI. Regulatory concerns are also contributing to a hesitancy to go full-throttle with AI.</p><p>Technology challenges are impacting the spread of AI as well. While big tech and academia are more actively and aggressively \"pushing advances in the performance of the underlying technology,\" it is more complicated for engineering solutions, which need data and talent.</p><p>The survey found that AI early adopters share several characteristics. As digital frontrunners, most are already investing in the cloud and Big Data. Having the resources, both employee-wise and financially, to do so means these firms tend to be larger companies that aren't necessarily limited to only one type of technology. Instead, these organizations are employing multiple AI tools for a variety of use cases concurrently. Finally, the companies with the biggest investments in AI tend to have nearly twice the C-level support as those companies that are not jumping into the AI space.</p><p>What's Shakin'?</p><p>McKendrick wrote a second, complementary article in the same issue of DBTA-. \"This Is the Year IoT and Cognitive Computing Begin to Shake Up the Database Market.\" In it, via interviews with a number of executives within the database industry, he identifies \"three trends that may forever disrupt the data world as we know it: the Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing--as exemplified by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and cloud computing.\" The article explores not just what kinds of value proposition these data management approaches offer, but also how soon results will be tangible. I'm going to stick to what McKendrick has to say about cognitive computing--the combination of AI and machine learning.</p><p>If--and this apparently is a big if--enterprises can figure out how to turn what's been hyped into real dividends, AI and machine learning will bring true value to the data community. One executive believes companies first \"need to zero in on the benefits machine learning can deliver\" so that it can be accurately measured and is not seen as something offering only limited ROI.</p><p>Another executive says AI is where Big Data was about 5 years ago. While companies agree that there is huge potential, what isn't as clear is how to put AI and machine learning to use. However, the concept of how AI and machine learning can save time and money is much easier to wrap one's head around than Big Data initially was.</p><p>Enterprises wishing to establish broader cloud adaption and overall digital transformation can add AI and machine learning to their toolkit, but only after the transition to the cloud has been made. Once an organization is future-ready, it \"can continue layering in emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, and more,\" one executive says. Another estimates that it might take as long as 2-5 years for the foundation to be laid and for AI and machine learning to become mainstream.</p><p>Unlike machine learning, which can use historical data--what a customer has purchased in the past--to predict what may happen in the next minutes or hours, AI enables current data to be used within seconds. Marketers are especially interested in targeted advertising and messaging through \"datasets to precisely identify customers with the right amount of disposable income and accurate blend of online behaviors to indicate they are looking for investment vehicles,\" an interviewee states. Whether organizations have \"enough trustworthy data and validated machine learning algorithms to correctly apply models or AI capabilities\" for sub-second decision making remains to be seen, he adds.</p><p>AI Content-Ment?</p><p>This brings us to the EContent Trending Topics piece \"Content Marketers and the Impact of AI,\" by Lin Pophal, which echoes many of the previously mentioned sentiments. In Pophal's article, one senior web content strategist says, \"We expect the most impactful changes in the ways organizations use content ... to come precisely from such collaboration between human talent and AI.\"</p><p>Pophal shares four areas of impact for AI in content marketing as outlined by a chief scientist: reducing production costs; microtargeting marketing segments with messages that will most likely appeal to the segments based on, for example, gender, a sporting preference, or the soundtrack being used in a clip; automating the understanding of content so the main ideas can be disseminated correctly and rapidly; and tracking outcomes to measure the impact of content marketing activities, which is a function that's taking on an increasing level of importance.</p><p>Lest anyone fear that AI will remove the need for human input, a founder and CEO of a marketing firm says the content developed by machines will still require human oversight and editing. That's largely because AI cannot create the humanity aspect of stories: Only real people can add in the soul and humor they need. Phew.</p><p>The Artificial Dilemma</p><p>Aside from hurting my brain when I try to understand how AI works, I continue to stumble over the \"artificial\" part of the phrase. The word has both good and bad connotations. Artificial limbs can help people become mobile or regain mobility. Artificial organs can save lives. But no food product boasts about having artificial ingredients. And artificial flavoring in the absence of real sugar literally leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So especially in a world in which fake news is always lurking, maybe it would be wise to come up with something to replace the word ahead of \"intelligence\" so it doesn't sound like it is describing someone who lied on his or her resume and really didn't graduate magna cum laude from Harvard or Oxford. Got any bright ideas?</p><p>Lauree Padgett is Information Today, Inc.'s editorial services manager.

Although preempted by federal criminal and copyright law, Section 230 let web platforms mostly police themselves.Previous attempts to modify Section 230 were met with dire warnings that companies such as Facebook would overzealously self-censor rather than risk multimillion-dollar judgments. And when FOSTA/SESTA passed, the prediction quickly proved true.On March 21, hours after Senate passage, Reddit deleted four forums for discussion of sex work, including r/Escorts, r/MaleEscorts, r/Hookers, and r/SugarDaddy, even though much of the content reportedly had nothing to do with illegal conduct. On March 23, Craigslist deleted its personal ad sections, which were among the Internet\u2019s earliest online dating and hookup tools, though sometimes used by people who advertised erotic massages for a price.Now, once Section 230 has been amended, those working against revenge porn, cyberbullying, fake news, and online terrorism are working to replicate the new law for their area.BackgroundThe Internet is young enough that the author of Section 230 still works as a senator.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote the law after a court ruled against 1990s chatroom provider Prodigy, which had been sued for defamation by an investment firm run by the fraudster who inspired Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character in \u201cWolf of Wall Street.\" Comments accused the firm of deceptive business practices. Federal criminal law always trumped Section 230, meaning creating a new crime offered a way to reduce its scope. FOSTA/SESTA took both approaches, creating a new crime of \u201cpromotion or facilitation of prostitution and reckless disregard of sex trafficking,\u201d punishable by up to 25 years in prison, while also amending Section 230 to say there\u2019s no liability exception in cases involving sex trafficking, child porn, or \u201cpromotion or facilitation of prostitution.\u201dWyden urged his colleagues not to change the law, arguing others would want their own carve-outs. Although Facebook endorsed the bill, Wyden alleged it was because removing protection \u201cwill pull up the ladder in the tech world, leaving the established giants alone at the top.\u201d\u201cI fear this bill will set off a chain reaction that leads Congress to cut away more categories of behavior from Section 230, and dismantle the legal framework that\u2019s given the United States the position it holds as a tech-economy superpower,\u201d Wyden warned. Only Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joined Wyden in voting \"no.\"Experts and interested parties say that amending Section 230 once will make it easier to do so again.\u201cIt is a huge psychological deal,\u201d said Alan Rozenshtein, a visiting law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe move from zero to one is so much harder than from one to two, two to three. It\u2019s so much harder to break that precedent, that Section 230 is this untouchable Magna Carta-like document for the Internet.\"\u201cWhen we look back 10 years from now, we will look at this period as an important turning point,\u201d Rozenshtein said. \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing is that Silicon Valley\u2019s legal and regulatory exceptionalism that they\u2019ve enjoyed for the past 20 years \u2014 that they\u2019re really smart and can self-regulate \u2014 that is over.\u201dWidely discussed carve-outs of Section 230 could include cyberbullying, election-related and fake-news activity, and terrorism. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s going to be a terrorism version of this,\u201d Rozenshtein said.But there\u2019s also a question of whether the law needs to be totally repealed and replaced with language addressing the knowledge and intent of platform operators.What's Next?Robert Tolchin, a New York lawyer suing Facebook on behalf of terror victims, argues Section 230 was interpreted too broadly by courts. He believes immunity shouldn\u2019t apply overseas, or negate the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows people to sue companies aiding terrorism.Tolchin represents U.S. citizens victimized by terrorism in Israel and France, and said it doesn\u2019t make sense to have immunity for companies such as Facebook that arguably provide services to criminals when other companies face liability. \u201cWould you ask the same question if a company was selling bullets to Hamas?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you give someone complete immunity, that gives them the power to do whatever they feel like or be as careless as you like, and that is what\u2019s going on with Facebook and Twitter now.\"Tolchin lost a federal ruling in May 2017 in a pair of cases he filed on behalf of U.S. and Israeli citizens victimized by Hamas. The judge found Section 230 \u201cprevents courts from entertaining civil actions that seek to impose liability on defendants like Facebook for allowing third parties to post offensive or harmful content or failing to remove such content once posted.\"Tolchin is appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which he hopes will break with other circuits by finding that the Anti-Terrorism Act holds primacy. Tolchin also represents family members of Nohemi Gonzalez who sued Google. Gonzales, a 26-year-old student, was killed in 2015 by Islamic State terrorists at a Paris restaurant. Gonzalez\u2019s relatives argued Google was liable because its YouTube platform was used by the terrorists. But Google moved to dismiss the case, citing Section 230, and won an October ruling in California.Tolchin said he's not sure Internet companies should have immunity for third-party content at all, but at the same time expressed concern about FOSTA/SESTA squeezing sex workers into less-safe situations. He believes terrorism victims deserve a path to sue, but that there may be even more political appetite to address election-related activity of foreign countries. Joshua Arisohn, an attorney who sued Twitter on behalf of families of two Americans murdered by a Jordanian policeman in 2015 \u2014 claiming the social platform didn\u2019t do enough to remove Islamic State content \u2014 argues carve-outs may not be enough. \u201cIt's probably time for full repeal at this point. When 230 was enacted, these were fledgling companies. Now, they are some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world,\u201d said Arisohn, who lost a 3-0 ruling before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in January.  \u201cAt the very least, there should be a carve-out for when these companies have knowledge of the misdeeds. If one of their millions of users does something improper and Twitter doesn't know about it, there's a reasonable argument that Twitter shouldn't be liable. But once Twitter knows about the illegal conduct, it should be required to take meaningful steps to stop it,\" he said.Arisohn said Section 230 has had a serious, negative impact on victims of terrorism.\u201cVictims of terrorism can't obtain justice by suing the terrorists themselves. These groups are overseas, and it's hard to reach their assets,\" he said. \u201cIf you provide material support to a terrorist organization, under the Anti-Terrorism Act, you can be held responsible for the attacks that group carries out. Unfortunately, courts read the [Communications Decency Act] as blocking these kinds of lawsuits when the entities providing material support to terrorists were social media companies.\"Mary Anne Franks, a University of Miami law professor who helped write pending federal revenge porn legislation, said it\u2019s time for a fundamental rethink of Section 230.\u201cThe fact that Section 230, long believed to be sacred, has now been amended does indicate that the era of the untouchable online intermediary may be over. That is not an era to be mourned, but FOSTA's approach is far from ideal. Sex trafficking is only one of the many ills facilitated by online intermediaries, including revenge porn, disinformation, doxxing, sextortion, data mining, and election tampering,\u201d she said.\u201cWhat is needed is reform that holds online intermediaries that knowingly facilitate, promote, or benefit from illegal activity to the same standards of accountability as offline intermediaries,\u201d Franks said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real justification for this kind of piecemeal approach. It doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problem ... it creates uncertainty in the law as we wait to see what the next exception is going to be, and it turns the debate about the merits of Section 230 into a debate about the merits of sex trafficking and prostitution laws.\u201dFranks said she believes \u201cthe tech industry and civil liberties groups\u2019 radically expansive interpretation of 230 contributed to the overcorrection of FOSTA.\u201dAfter talk of federal revenge porn legislation evoked concern about modifying Section 230, the bill Franks helped draft with Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., sidesteps the issue by creating a new proposed federal crime for non-consensual distribution of sensitive images. Franks further designed a civil liability exemption for platforms unless they \"intentionally solicit, or knowingly and predominantly distribute, content\u201d that the service knows is a violation of the law.\u201cWe didn\u2019t amend Section 230 because there was no need to. The Section 230 obstacle disappears on its own when revenge porn is criminalized under federal law,\u201d Franks said.Goodbye, regulation-free Internet?The anti-sex trafficking push that blew the first hole into Section 230 immunity arrived the same month Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress to promise greater efforts to safeguard user data and to censor anonymous content that may originate in Russia.\u201cThe everything-goes free speech zone of the early Internet may no longer be compatible with a society that wants to be protected from speech and conduct it doesn\u2019t like,\u201d said Rozenshtein, the University of Minnesota law professor.Rozenshtein said he doesn\u2019t believe a cleanup on mainstream sites such as Facebook and Twitter would force an evolution of the Internet by sending users in search of new, sophisticated platforms for expression. Although criminals will seek out new platforms, \u201cThis will change the behavior of normal people, and those people are locked into the normal platforms,\u201d he said.\u201cThe 'con' is censorship,\" Rozenshtein said. \"What is terrorism? Is it terrorism to say that Israel should not have a right to exist? Some might view it as aiding and abetting Hamas, a terrorist organization. Some may view it as perfectly legitimate political speech.... Now, at least [web platforms] can maintain a neutral stance.\"On the horizon are even deeper changes to how the Internet works. Not only are there proposals to expand liability for allegedly harmful posts, but also proposals to allow individuals to force web platforms to remove content about themselves that they dislike.The U.S. debate over a so-called \u201cright to be forgotten\" began recently with state legislation in California.\u201cEurope is a laboratory for us,\u201d Rozenshtein said. \u201cWe\u2019re so scared of government regulation and so in love with Silicon Valley that we\u2019re treating this with the utmost care and sensitivity. ... In Europe, it\u2019s not their companies.\"Democratic Assemblyman Marc Levine, sponsor of the California right to be forgotten bill, said \"regulations for big tech are at an early stage.\"\u201cBig tech has created Michel Foucault's panopticon, and we are all in a surveillance state,\u201d he said, referring to a circular prison allowing full view of the inmates. \u201cFoucault was concerned about how it affected discipline, but now, people are suddenly concerned about photos and the content they and others have generated ... when we want to talk about how we are being surveilled, it's not necessarily by the state, but by the wealthiest corporate interests in the history of the world.\u201d</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2030250180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S60-4F11-DY0W-4008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2095\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

But a new report reveals that the widening reach of technology\u00a0isn't the panacea to the world's problems that a lot of us would\u00a0like to believe. A report issued by the World Bank\u00a0found that while tech has spread rapidly around the world, the associated benefits have lagged behind[3]. These so-called 'digital dividends' come in the form of 'boosted growth, expanded opportunities, and improved service delivery'; nonetheless, the positive impact of technology has 'fallen short and is unevenly distributed.' As Somini Sengupta reports for The New York Times, the report reveals that the far-reaching changes catalyzed by technology haven't expanded economic opportunities[4] or improved access to basic public services in the way that many people expected. Instead, 'the report warned darkly, Internet innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment.' The report finds that those who are already economically well-off and well-educated have been able to take advantage of the advent of the Internet economy. But many in poorer regions and less-affluent households are still without Internet access, with 60% of the world's population remaining offline. And that's despite industry efforts[5] \u2014 like Google's Project Loon or Facebook's Internet.org \u2014 to expand Internet access worldwide. The report also challenges the tech industry's tendency 'to see itself as the solver of the world's greatest problems,' as Sengupta aptly puts it, with\u00a0the finding\u00a0that 'the poorest households are more likely to have access to mobile phones than to toilets or clean water.'As the\u00a0report explains, the organization has found that 'the full benefits of the information and communications transformation will not be realized unless countries continue to improve their business climate, invest in people's education and health, and promote good governance.' It adds, 'In countries where these fundamentals are weak, digital technologies have not boosted productivity or reduced inequality. Countries that complement technology investments with broader economic reforms reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, more jobs, and better services.' The organization concluded that the way that a country takes advantage of information technology depends on what kind of society it is. In some countries, women are discouraged from going online, and in the countries in South Asia, women are far less likely than men to own a mobile phone. People who are illiterate \u2014 still 20% of the world's population \u2014 can't take advantage of the Internet and the opportunities afforded by it at all. And in the developing world, there are far fewer opportunities to make a career in the tech industry, which employs just 1% of the workforce in poor countries, as compared to 3% to 5% of the workforce in wealthy countries. The bank has called on countries to make the Internet 'universal, affordable, open and safe.'\u00a0Sengupta notes that the bank's survey found that while more than half of the countries in the world have privacy laws, only 51 of those are in the developing world. Simply expanding Internet access isn't enough to enable citizens to take advantage of its benefits, and the bank also recommends that countries strengthen\u00a0regulations that ensure competition among companies, help workers strengthen their skills for the new Internet economy, and hold government institutions accountable.The report should serve as a wake-up call, both for governments and for the tech companies that are perpetually and perhaps overzealously optimistic about the positive impacts that the spread of technology can have on the world. They'll need to weigh the effects of their efforts to widen Internet access, which is a complicated effort to undertake in a responsible way \u2014 as illustrated particularly well\u00a0by the ability of\u00a0companies like Facebook to attract criticism for the implementation of their Internet access projects. (Internet.org critics have their doubts about the service's implications for net neutrality, and its potential to enable Facebook to effectively subsume the Internet for consumers who can't afford a data plan.) As we approach\u00a0the cusp of massive changes brought by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics, which both promise\u00a0to fundamentally alter many jobs and even entire countries' economies, it's interesting to imagine what stands on the other side of the precipice \u2014 and the moment seems to afford\u00a0a final chance to consider our priorities.More from Gear ...yle Cheat Sheet:Smartphone Getting Old?

The problem: They don't have a foreign policy.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The phrases \"progressive politics\" and \"national security\" rarely appear together. When \"national security\" shows up in the pages of leftist political publications at all, it's usually as an object of criticism. Yet, were the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party to take over Washington-Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for one, seems to be burnishing her foreign policy credentials-the burden of national security would be on their shoulders. Which is why it's important to acknowledge that ideological friction between progressivism and national security is not inevitable and these phrases need not be contradictions in terms. In recent months, even voices on the left have started to decry the absence of \"the left wing's foreign policy agenda\" and acknowledge that progressives are historically far more comfortable advocating for social and economic justice at home than they are litigating what that should mean for U.S. conduct abroad. </p><p>But the argument that the left is totally silent on foreign policy simply isn't true. Georgetown University's Daniel Nexon recently proposed that \"corporate power, concentrated wealth, environmental dangers, corruption\" are threats that should galvanize a leftist foreign policy today. And as Princeton University scholar and longtime co-editor of the leftist Dissent magazine Michael Walzer has observed, the left's common pursuit of social justice, economic equality and cultural pluralism at home extends to the global stage, in principle. </p><p>People on the left routinely oppose unilateral wars of choice, like Iraq in 2003, Syria in 2013, and the North Korean near-miss in 2017. A principled humanitarian argument for military intervention could've been made in the Syria case, and yet it was the left that most vocally agitated against any kind of involvement there because they saw it as an elective war. They advocate multilateral solutions to transnational problems like climate change and anti-corruption. Indeed, they believe environmental degradation and international corruption are major foreign policy concerns, a mild contrast with mainstream Democrats and a wild contrast with the Trump administration. And they support protecting human rights in countries with long-disenfranchised or oppressed populations. As the Bush and Clinton administrations chose to make China an economic partner in the 1990s, it was the left that marched in the street, supported sanctions on China and passed around \"Free Tibet\" stickers. Theirs is a moralistic, values-oriented foreign policy whether at home or abroad. </p><p>The problem, then, isn't that the left lacks any foreign policy positions. Rather, it's that those positions are sometimes in tension with one another and tell us little about progressive thinking when it comes to a security agenda even when they aren't in tension. </p><p>Different from Neoliberalism How? </p><p>One of the problems with the left's principled foreign policy positions is that they resemble something the left has spent a lifetime rallying against: neoliberalism. For the left, the term \"neoliberalism\" has often had a pejorative association with capitalist empire; a ruling class controlling the global means of production while the rest of us take out loans for our avocado toast. Yet neoliberal foreign policy-especially as understood in the field of international relations-reflects a commitment to democracy promotion, human rights, economic interdependence, multilateralism over unilateralism, the primacy of upholding international commitments and the legitimacy of international institutions like the United Nations. In other words, a neoliberal foreign policy looks strikingly similar to what the left repeatedly advocates. It should thus be unsurprising that some neoliberals are of the political left.</p><p>There is one major difference: Neoliberals and the left have usually parted ways when it comes to prioritizing what I would characterize as process versus outcomes in foreign policy. Neoliberalism's logic is one of process in the sense that certain types of conduct abroad over time produce a certain type of world. The earliest conviction of neoliberalism was the necessity of ensuring the free flow of commodities and capital across borders. That first principle eventually necessitated both the acknowledgment of some degree of protections for individual rights (ironically, human beings are capital too) and the legitimacy of international law-specifically the need to respect and enforce international contracts. Credible contracting, in turn, has meant sustaining the principle of international commitments. Some contracts, such as treaties promising to protect select U.S. allies, require the possibility of using force abroad in the name of enforcing American promises. The belief is that such commitments, when credible, actually prevent the aggression that might force the United States to make good on them. Thus, the sales pitch for neoliberal foreign policy is that its mutually reinforcing package of ideas-free markets, interdependence, democracy, human rights and institutions-encourages international cooperation, discourages conflict and promotes a shared sense of justice among nations, especially in the form of a rising economic tide that lifts all boats (global aggregate economic development). This was the logic behind postwar institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and, eventually, the World Trade Organization.</p><p>For certain segments of the left, however, transborder capitalism-which is only one part of the neoliberal bargain but the part on which the left has transfixed for decades-has produced unacceptable social and political outcomes in the form of stunted economic development, eroded sovereign control over national economies, displaced low-skilled workers and even spawned political corruption. These undesirable occurrences derive from the neoliberal tendency to treat an interconnected world economy as sacrosanct and the uneven distribution of wealth across the world as trivial or a necessary evil. The left likes that interdependence potentially inhibits conflict, that human rights have gone legitimately mainstream and that democracy has spread-all outcomes that have occurred thanks in part to (not despite) neoliberalism's 20th century prominence. But at least some leftists loathe the idea that capitalism might have played a necessary role in producing these outcomes. </p><p>The left isn't wrong to see a certain unfairness in the Reagan-Thatcher economic vision as applied to the Global South, or in the way the World Bank and IMF forced developing nations to relinquish economic sovereignty. There is both a logic and a moral imperative to treating extreme global inequality as a problem to be addressed through foreign policy. But emphasizing outcomes has led the left to adopt positions that don't emanate from a clear theory of how means and ends are supposed to relate. How do you get to the just outcomes you prize? A focus on the content of ends leaves unanswered the question of means. This is where a coherent international agenda would be invaluable.</p><p>The world too easily throws progressive preferences into obvious conflict. Are you, for instance, willing to undo the strategic benefits of economic interdependence (such as the absence of great-power wars) if it more fairly redistributes the benefits of the global economy? Facing ethnic cleansing campaigns or genocides, what will staunch a rising civilian body count except for the threat or use of military force? It's not that other parts of the political spectrum have questions like these figured out and the left doesn't. It's just that the left hasn't grappled with these questions from a position of power and constrained resources, and there's a strand of pacifism on the left that would not actually acknowledge the utility of force, even in instances where it would spare the mass slaughter of the innocent. A positive foreign policy agenda requires a statement of positive action-not just what you oppose, but what you stand for and intend to do.</p><p>No Theory of SecurityThere's a second problem with progressive foreign policy preferences to the extent we can draw them out: None of it amounts to a statement about the hard choices involved in national security affairs. Put another way, the most identifiable tropes of leftist foreign policy tell us little about the kinds of foreign policy decisions the United States needs to make in order to secure itself in a tumultuous world. </p><p>It's easy to say that trillions of dollars spent on defense should be diverted to health care and education, or that we should avoid ending up in another Vietnam quagmire. But if given the congressional power of the purse or the policy levers of the executive, what will the left decide on national security, even in broad strokes? The list of issues is long, but there are a few clusters of decisions on defense and geopolitics that would reveal much about whether the trajectory of the left ultimately skews toward the radical or the pragmatic. </p><p>On national defense:Militaries can't be built on-demand to meet the threats of the day. They have to be built in expectation of future challenges. What should the size and shape of the U.S. military be? What roles and missions does it need to be prepared to handle? What geopolitical risks is the left willing to accept by shrinking the military? What are the criteria for shrinkage? And how, if at all, should U.S. forces be globally distributed? Even if an empowered left believes the use of force should only take place within multilateral coalitions officially sanctioned by the United Nations, that has implications for force structure. A defense budget still has to be submitted to reflect that kind of mission set. </p><p>On nuclear disarmament:Nuclear abolition has been a longtime passion project of the left. But would they seek rapid and unilateral nuclear disarmament whatever the existential vulnerabilities it might pose to the United States? An empowered left would doubtless pursue an arms control agenda with other nuclear powers, but 1) that's a more modest pursuit than the utopianism of full disarmament, and 2) with rivals like Russia and rogues like North Korea, mutual threat reduction measures will only take you so far. President Barack Obama's position embodied progressive leaning pragmatism-promoting a vision of a world without nukes and seeking out arms control negotiations where possible, but in practice acknowledging that some level of nuclear weapons both maintain deterrence between nuclear rivals and helps prevent allies like South Korea and Japan from going nuclear themselves. Could the left get on board with that? </p><p>On international order:Russia and China both seek spheres of influence that would override the formal sovereignty of their neighbors. If they had their way, and to some extent they currently do, they'd exercise exclusionary control over the foreign and economies policies of the smaller states along their geographic peripheries. This was the dominant mode of international diplomacy in the age of empires during the 19th century-great powers treating smaller powers like commodities to be swapped and hoarded. The current international system, built around institutions like the United Nations and an alphabet soup of treaties and regimes, formally recognizes the sovereign equality of states. In practice, of course, even the United States has frequently violated that principle of sovereign equality. But permitting Russia and China to do the same now would perpetuate one of the travesties of injustice that the left has railed against going back as far as Mark Twain-national self-determination for the powerful only.</p><p>So when assertive great powers erode the independence of smaller states-whether through predatory economics or hybrid warfare-will the left prioritize cooperation among the great powers for the sake of stability at the expense of smaller states' preferences? Will the left enter defense cooperation arrangements that attempt to balance and inhibit assertions of influence by other great powers? Or will they staunchly defend the principle of sovereign equality among states, which at a certain point starts to resemble (ironically) neoconservatism? Senator Bernie Sanders used his only foreign policy speech in 2017 to simultaneously take issue with international financial institutions while still endorsing the liberal international order more broadly. Seeing the strategic bets of neoliberalism as something worth reforming rather than junking entirely, as President Donald Trump seems to have decided, implies not just pragmatism, but that Sanders sees some merit in the bets of the past.</p><p>On authoritarianism and democracy:It's one thing to say America won't help overthrow democratically elected governments-as in did in Chile in 1973, for instance-or that it will no longer impose democracy on others through the barrel of a gun. But what kind of relationships will a progressive government cultivate with the growing number of dictatorships around the world? There are already laws in place preventing foreign military assistance to individuals known or suspected of human rights abuses, but what about foreign military sales to illiberal governments like Pakistan and Egypt? Or development assistance to countries at risk of being coopted by China, like the Philippines (still technically a U.S. ally) or the many vulnerable Pacific Island nations? For the sake of the China market, will the left make the same implicit deal as past presidential administrations-circumscribing a relationship with democratic Taiwan in various ways so that the United States can maintain a functional and profitable relationship with authoritarian China? </p><p>Perhaps most important in the digital age, how will the left choose to regulate Silicon Valley's Big Tech collaborations with dictatorships abroad that would use the technology of American companies to systematically oppress their own populations? Right now China is courting Facebook and Google even as reports emerge that it runs an oppressive surveillance state against its minority Uighur population and is developing a technology-based social credit system (yes, like the one in Black Mirror). The most prominent voices on the left speak out against large multinationals as a general proposition, but have said little about the specific issue of American technology going to work for neo-Orwellianism in China. </p><p>Progressive views on foreign policy don't leave many hints about how the left would answer important questions on national security like those posed above. This is a shame because America's longstanding consensus in favor of liberal internationalism has been fractured, and nothing has replaced it. What's more, there's much within a liberal internationalist agenda that the left would probably like to salvage if it invested the intellectual effort in construction as much as it has criticism.</p><p>There's an opportunity to articulate a moral foreign policy that nevertheless rejects neoconservatism; that promotes a fidelity to international order without robbing developing-world economies; that takes international commitments seriously without being the world's police; that probes for opportunities to collaborate with great power competitors without turning a blind eye to their aggression against smaller states; and that balances the harm it sees in the wanton use of American power abroad with a recognition of the positive role it plays. </p><p>The left is more than capable of a principled national security agenda that actually does make America safer. But it requires eschewing old antagonisms and taking national security seriously, reckoning the left's moral convictions and the outcomes they seek with the world as it is. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-219743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7H-SRB1-F118-94XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2634\"/><timeReceived>9:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

But she didn't offer many details about how she plans to break up Amazon, even though Amazon fits the traditional definition of antitrust better than Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And she's not the only one. 2020 candidate Bernie Sanders constantly slams Amazon for treating warehouse workers poorly -- a well-documented travesty -- which bodes ill for Amazon should one of them win the presidency. Furthermore, Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate are seemingly united in their crusade to take down Big Tech companies.</p><p>Amazon seems to understand this, which could be why Amazon reportedly reversed course on its controversial requirement for its third-party sellers (i.e., small businesses and entrepreneurs) to offer the lowest price for their products on Amazon.com. Prior to the policy change, anyone who sold their products on Amazon could not offer them for a lower price on a competing website.</p><p>This turn of events could be a classic example of the threat of regulation prompting companies into self-regulation.</p><p>But Amazon still engages in other anticompetitive practices, like copying third-party sellers' products and turning around and selling them for a cheaper price under the \"Amazon\" brand. Not only that, but some economists worry that Amazon's infiltration of the D.C. metro area with its HQ2 could persuade regulators to turn a blind eye to Amazon's monopolistic tendencies.</p><p>Reversing one bad policy may not be enough to save Amazon from antitrust litigation or a regulatory crack-down.</p><p>In December 2018, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to the Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, Mark Delrahim outlining economic and antitrust concerns over Amazon's relationship with its third-party sellers.</p><p>\"Recent economic research has demonstrated that price parity provisions -- also known as most favored nation clauses -- can harm consumers, especially when enforced by large tech platforms with significant market power,\" he wrote. \"Given Amazon's leading position in the U.S. e-commerce market, it may now possess the degree of market power at which its price parity provisions could raise serious competition concerns.\"</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission's Rohit Chopra, known for his anti-Big Tech stance, tweeted earlier this week that \"in some countries,\" Amazon's practices are \"restricted or banned.\"</p><p>According to a 2018 Yale study, for example, Europe pursued antitrust enforcement over similar anticompetitive practices from online hotel booking websites like Booking.com and Expedia.</p><p>But law enforcement still hasn't pursued antitrust litigation against Amazon for undercutting its own sellers with Amazon-branded knock-offs.</p><p>Siri Terjesen, Director of American University's Center for Innovation, told InsideSources that she knows many entrepreneurs and small business owners undercut by Amazon.</p><p>\"I advise some guys in northern Virginia who sell on Amazon, and Amazon had all their selling data and decided they were going to create a similar product, and so they did,\" Terjesen said. \"And my friends then had to still use Amazon but ended paying all these warehousing fees while Amazon sold out [the Amazon-brand knockoff products] and then offered theirs.\"</p><p>In other words, Amazon creates its own knockoff of a popular product sold on its platform, then prioritizes the knockoff instead of the original, causing third-party sellers to lose money and business.</p><p>\"Unfortunately we might see these monopolies emerge in technology where firms try to create artificial non-markets, and that's obviously bad for firms and bad for consumers,\" she said. \"I do have concerns when Amazon becomes more than just a platform but is basically limiting others access to the platform. I've heard stories from many entrepreneurs across America who have used this marketplace.\"</p><p>Terjesen said Warren is right about some of her critiques of Big Tech, but Terjesen isn't convinced antitrust is the right solution to the problem.</p><p>\"I think the only constant in all of this is, Amazon is evolving and growing and vertically and horizontally into all of the other businesses,\" she said. \"So you have to look at each of these businesses on its own merits. We also need to think about the fact that technology regulation doesn't always reach its desired aim. I'm certainly reluctant to create more of a government bureaucracy to regulate tech because there's no way the government an respond as quickly to where the platforms are going.\"</p><p>At the same time, she added, Amazon's big move into the D.C. area means more lobbying dollars and more influence over tech and business regulation. That's a major concern given Amazon's anticompetitive inclinations.</p><p>\"All of the cost of trying to attract HQ2 is a major cost to the system,\" she said. \"I have some major concerns [D.C. is] underwriting Amazon business. The owner of Amazon also owns The Washington Post which a lot of people still read and then you have a marketplace of ideas also being attached to the marketplace for items.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

An August 2 article by Michael Hiltzik in the Los Angeles Times entitled \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-20150802-column.html\">Tech industry's persistent claim of worker shortage may be phony</url> \"   covers some of the issues related to the use of the H-1B visa program.</p><p><br/><br/>The H-1B is a non-immigrant <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_visa target=_blank\">visa program in the U.S.</url> under the <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965 target=_blank\">Immigration and Nationality Act</url> that allows U.S. employers to employ <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_worker target=_blank\">foreign workers</url> temporarily in specialty occupations. Regulations define a \"specialty occupation\" as requiring theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in a field of human endeavor including but not limited to engineering, and requiring the attainment of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent as a minimum.<br/><br/>More from The Power Plant<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://powerelectronics.com/blog/semiconductor-companies-are-divided-getting-new-hires\">Semiconductor Companies Are Divided on Getting New Hires</url><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://powerelectronics.com/blog/engineers-inventing-ourselves-out-work\">Engineers Inventing Ourselves Out of Work?</url><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://powerelectronics.com/blog/does-technology-aid-workforce\">Does Technology Aid the Workforce?</url><br/><br/>H-1B work-authorization is strictly limited to employment by the sponsoring employer.The normal duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. In special cases, the maximum duration of the H-1B visa can be 10 years.<br/><br/>Previously, the law limited the total number of foreign nationals to 65,000 who may be issued a visa or otherwise provided H-1B status each <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year#United_States target=_blank\">fiscal year</url> (FY). However, if these reserved visas are not used, then they are made available in the next fiscal year to applicants from other countries. Due to these unlimited exemptions and roll-overs, the number of H-1B visas issued each year is significantly more than the 65,000 cap, with 117,828 having been issued in FY2010, 129,552 in FY2011, and 135,991 in FY2012.<br/><br/>Hiltzik says visa issuance is now capped at 85,000 per year, including foreign holders of U.S. advanced degrees. However, a bill sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) would raise the limit to as many as 195,000.<br/><br/>An example of a \"phony plea\" described by Hiltzik was a statement from a lobbyist for Qualcomm that \"companies like hers face a dire shortage of university graduates in engineering. The urgent remedy she advocated was to raise the cap on visas for foreign-born engineers.\" However, the lobbyist didn't mention that Qualcomm must have more engineers than it needed because a few weeks later the company announced that it would cut its work force 15%, or nearly 5,000 people. Two-thirds of the company's work force are engineers, so some will certainly be cut.<br/><br/>Hiltzik points out that \"the mismatch between Qualcomm's plea to import more high-tech workers and its efforts to downsize its existing payroll hints at the phoniness of the high-tech sector''s persistent claim of a 'shortage' of U.S. graduates in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\"<br/><br/>It depends on who you want to believe as to whether there really is a shortage of engineers. <url normalizedValue=\"http://brook.gs/1sUHV7o\">Jonathan Rothwell of the Brookings Institution</url> said the high-tech industry contends that U.S. universities simply aren't producing enough graduates to meet demand, leading to a \"skills gap\" that must be filled from overseas if the U.S. is to maintain its global technical dominance. Low unemployment rates among computer workers imply that demand has outpaced supply. He says, \"Companies struggle to fill job vacancies for skilled programmers and other STEM fields.\"<br/><br/>Another study suggested that the STEM shortage is a myth, says <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1G2QmEp\">Hal Salzman, an expert on technology education</url> at Rutgers. \"The supply of graduates is substantially larger than the demand for them in industry.\" Qualcomm is not the only high-tech company to be aggressively downsizing. The computer industry, led by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1G2QmEp\">cut nearly 60,000 jobs last year,</url> according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. The electronics industry pared an additional 20,000 positions.<br/><br/>The chairman of MIT's physics department lamented that an entire generation \"had been told that this was a great national emergency, that we needed scientists,\" at the time. \"Now they are out on the street and naturally they feel cheated.\" California aerospace workers in the 1980s and high-tech engineers after the dot-com collapse in 2000 felt the same dizzying sensation.<br/><br/>Hiltzik says that nailing down the demand and employment in STEM fields is difficult because there's no single accepted definition for a STEM job. Estimates of the number of STEM jobs <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-3/c3h.htm\">range from 5 million to 19 million,</url> according to the National Science Foundation, depending on what's included. Many are technical jobs that don't require even a bachelor's degree.<br/><br/>Michael Teitelbaum, a demographer at Harvard Law School and author of the 2014 book \"Falling Behind? Boom, Bust, and the Global Race for Scientific Talent,\" challenges claims of a STEM shortage in the U.S. Teitelbaum and others observe that the tech industry's lobbying to hire more foreign engineers is at cross purposes with its call to encourage more U.S. students to acquire STEM degrees. After all, why should students labor for four or six years to enter industries in which they can be suddenly replaced in an outsourcing campaign?<br/><br/>Hiltzik notes that \"raising the visa limit exploits a loophole in immigration law to save money-workers on these temporary visas are typically paid less than U.S. employees doing the same work, and more complaisant with American bosses because they'll be deported if they lose their jobs. Companies such as Google and Qualcomm do benefit from H-1B visas, but on a lower scale than the outsourcing firms. In 2013, Qualcomm secured visa approvals for <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1F6vYfZ\">909 new workers,</url> according to government figures compiled by Computerworld. Infosys got 6,300.\"<br/><br/>It's unlikely that such hard numbers will silence the drumbeat for more high-tech immigration, Teitelbaum says, as long as big tech companies have the attention of Congress. \"The lobbying opposition is weak,\" he said. \"There's no interest group that's as well organized and financed to say otherwise.\"<br/><br/>The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires that the hiring of a foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers comparably employed. To comply with the statute, regulations require that the wages offered to a foreign worker must be the prevailing wage rate for the occupational classification in the area of employment. However, if you replace a worker who has 20 years of experience with a new employee, how do you determine equal pay? The worker who has worked in a company for 20 years would certainly have been paid more than a new employee. Obviously, there are ways to manipulate the \"prevailing\" wage to benefit the company.<br/><br/>Using H-1B workers could be just another way to replace older, more expensive workers with lower wage earners. With wages making up the highest percentage of a company's operating expenses, this serves to improve profits. Still, the company can lose its technical expertise by cutting experienced employees.<br/><br/>Another question that arises is whether foreign workers have better engineering backgrounds than their foreign counterparts. That's a hard question to answer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POWET-218932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POWET2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GR4-61X1-DY2V-D0R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261833</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Power Electronics Technology</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 19, 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And we agree that legislation clarifying the duties of those who collect and use personal information is important, as is delineating enforcement responsibilities among agencies and jurisdictions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're concerned, however, by the tendency of some to shoehorn pet theories into the debate - notably the passionate but incomplete argument that it's time to jettison decades of antitrust policy that limits the government to intervening only when market concentration has, or could, cause higher prices for consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vague alternative, proposed by critics on the left and right, is a return to a failed framework that boils down to, at best, a general belief that \"big is bad\" and, at worst, to politically-based payback for companies on the wrong side of an election.</p><p>             Writing recently in the New York Times, law professor Tim Wu urged antitrust enforcers to launch sweeping lawsuits against Facebook and other \"Big Tech\" platforms that would likely last a decade or more. Anything less, Wu says, amounts to giving \"these companies a pass when it comes to antitrust enforcement, allowing them to dominate their markets and buy up their competitors.\"</p><p>The goal of Wu's approach is not to actually win so much as it is to distract the companies' leaders. The litigation is not a means but the end in itself. Paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson, Wu advocates spilling the corporate equivalent of the \"blood of patriots,\" attacking relentlessly regardless of whether there's actually, you know, a sustainable case.</p><p>That logic is oddly aligned with the views of some, including President Trump and his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who believe they are justified in threatening companies they view as politically hostile on the fuzzy grounds that there is a \"very antitrust situation.\"           </p><p>Wu's best example of how this abuse of legal process works was the U.S. government's 13-year crusade in the 1970s to break up IBM. At the time, IBM was the undisputed leader of the computer business.</p><p>Though the government was never able to prove the company had, as accused, \"undertaken exclusionary and predatory conduct with the aim and effect of eliminating competition,\" Wu believes the cost and uncertainty for the company of the extended legal fight saved the U.S. economy, giving personal computers an opening to proliferate and unseat IBM's mainframe computer \"monopoly.\"</p><p>Never mind that IBM was the most successful seller of PCs and, through its relationship with Lenovo, still is. The company was certainly hurt by the ultimately abandoned case, as were, in later examples, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm and others.</p><p>But do antitrust jihads really help consumers more than it hurts them? Probably not. While well-founded prosecutions, such as those leading to the 1982 breakup of AT&amp;T, did open critical markets, that success may not be duplicated elsewhere. In fact, Philip Verveer, a Visiting Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and the government's lead counsel in the AT&amp;T case, recently concluded that unleashing antitrust against today's platform companies would amount to little more than \"an act of faith that a successful prosecution would bring about benefits.\"</p><p>There's no need to gamble. The more effective regulator of digital markets has always been the happy confluence of engineering and business innovations in hardware, software and communications driving exponential improvements in speed, quality, size, energy usage and, of course, cost.</p><p>As computing continues to improve, markets become unsettled, innovation flourishes, and new leaders emerge. It's not the arbitrary release of the \"blood of patriots\" that best corrects market imbalances. It's the normal cycles of capitalism sped up by disruptive innovation, or what economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 famously called \"creative destruction.\"</p><p>If the tech sector was immune to that process, as some allege, we would expect stagnant productivity and wage growth, with profits protected and funneled to shareholders.</p><p>But that view doesn't square with recent findings from Michael Mandel, chief economist at the Progressive Policy Institute. According to Mandel, who has been measuring the digital economy for decades, the technology sector broadly \"accounted for almost half of non-health private sector growth between 2007 and 2017.\" Technology prices, at the same time, \"fell by 15%, compared to a 21 percent increase in the rest of the non-health private sector.\"</p><p>Annual pay for tech workers (including hourly workers at e-commerce fulfillment centers) rose at more than twice the rate of other industries. Job growth in tech was four times faster.</p><p>Lower prices, higher pay and growing productivity: That doesn't suggest a problem, or at least not one requiring radical restructuring of the companies driving the gains.</p><p>Consider the alternative approach taken in Europe, which has ramped up an aggressive attack of U.S. technology companies, applying the kind of expansive view of competition law urged by Wu and others. European businesses are still largely no-shows in the digital revolution, the result not of monopolies but of the micromanagement of employment, investment and infrastructure by regulators. Rather than freeing up local innovators to benefit European consumers, the European Union seems content simply to fine successful U.S. businesses.</p><p>The European approach highlights another problem with calls for U.S. antitrust enforcers to punish platform companies just for their size. Looking ahead to the technology drivers of the near future, such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, any hopes for the United States to lead internationally depend on heavy investment today in research and development. Many of the highest-risk bets are being placed by, you guessed it, today's \"monopoly\" companies.</p><p>So what should U.S. regulators do? The starting point is vigilance in applying tried-and-true tools to new harms. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, has already brought over 150 enforcement actions against tech companies in the last decade for violations of consumer protection laws, reaching settlements that in many cases include decades of ongoing oversight and reporting.</p><p>The trade agency is gearing up a broad review of Facebook to see whether the company's many embarrassing failures of the past few years amount to violations of a 2011 consent decree or, indeed, new violations. And the commissioners recently told Congress that they want additional resources and authority to better enforce existing law, joining a bipartisan call for targeted legislation, particularly on consumer data collection and use.</p><p>Tech's loudest critics argue that the gears of government are turning too slowly. But that's actually another reason why calls to simply throw out measured approaches to regulating competition are dangerous, despite their populist appeal. Even assuming new standards could be developed that wouldn't stall the innovation engine driving the U.S. economy, rewriting federal competition law, realistically, would take Congress and the courts decades to hammer out.</p><p>Fortunately, the next wave of disruptive technology is always coming. It won't fix everything.

Though the guests know they must bolt before it is too late, 'The music and wines are so seductive that we do not want to leave, but we do ask, 'What time is it? What time is it?' Only none of the clocks have any hands.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s, the mania was for the 'nifty 50' American companies like Disney, which had been the 'go-go' stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.</p><p>Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands - and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of a irrational euphoria are growing.</p><p>One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.</p><p>Seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new peaks - the Dow hit 22,000 this week - the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion dollar company.</p><p>No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.</p><p>The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies who were building the nuts and bolts of the internet - including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel - and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations - from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning - are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the 'electricity of the 21st century.'</p><p>Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil's not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.</p><p>It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select tech companies - mainly the internet giants - are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for tech companies today is 18.</p><p>However, the scale of today's tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into just the technology sector every year for the last three years - the highest flows since the peak in 2000 - and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.</p><p>These new private funding channels are creating 'unicorns,' companies that haven't gone public yet are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.</p><p>We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.</p><p>The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries from publishing to automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing less to increase productivity than to waste time and brainpower has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as 'electronic heroin.' A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.</p><p>The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the 'nifty 50' stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.</p><p>Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.</p><p>Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 - or earlier.</p><p>The clocks have no hands, and the Black Horsemen may appear at any time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY0608201700012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P69-BH51-F00C-61NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1198\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 6, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzZCNTg2QjlBNDE4NDkxQTlFQ0Y5OURCQkY4QTNCOUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzYxNEIxMEU2OTEzNERBQ0I2NTRDQzczNzgyNjI5OTk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Online Transactions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkNFQUM0RTIzMDQzNEU3MEExOTdFRDEzRjBDOEI1OEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVEMzEzOENBNTZGNDQ1RThEODQzODc2ODY3NDhDNDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D17C</classCode><className>BRIC COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7UJ</classCode><className>ECONOMIC BUBBLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

As for teens between 10 and 15, only the truly impoverished don't have a mobile phone of some kind.As I discuss below, the primary dynamic of the past decade has been the integration of web-based services into mobile telephony. By any measure, that cycle is now complete.I recently explored technology's ties to financialization and deflationary trends in prices and profits:Two Intertwined Dynamics Are Transforming the Economy: Technology and Financialization[2]Technology Is Not Just Disruptive, It's Disastrously Deflationary[3]The basic idea here is that the tech bubble has been inflated by a unique set of circumstances:-- financialization, one manifestation of which is unprofitable Unicorn companies going public at lofty valuations (see chart)-- the establishment of quasi-monopolies that have become immensely profitable.These conditions are changing.1. Many tech giants (Microsoft and Apple) are moving to monthly services, in effect becoming profitable utilities. </p><p>These may be profitable but they are no longer fast-growing in terms of revenues or profit margins.2. Calls for regulation of lightly regulated data-based corporations (Facebook and Google) are rising.3. The weakness of Lyft and Uber stocks after their IPOs suggest a weakening appetite for betting on growth at any cost as a business model.4. The profitable build-out of the past decade has been integrating web services with mobile telephony and data-mining social media and search. These have now been built out, so the tech cycle has reached stagnation in the S-Curve--a reality visible in Google's recent earnings disappointment.There are two other trends that don't attract quite the media attention that soaring profits do:1. Previous tech cycles / bubbles were founded on technologies that had the potential to greatly boost productivity. This cycle ( integrating web services with mobile telephony) is more about consumer convenience and distribution of services such as AirBNB and Uber than productivity.To the degree that entertainment and the addictive distractions of social media are now at everyone's fingertips, and people are checking their phones hundreds of times a day, productivity has suffered rather than increased.2. The services that are now distributed to mobile telephony are tremendously deflationary to revenues and profits. To note just one example of many, with a smart phone in hand, there's no longer any need to buy a camera or portable music player.More pernicious is the deflationary impact on revenues and wages. The number of Uber drivers who earn the equivalent of what taxi drivers once earned (no great sum in most cases) is small.In effect, Uber monetized an under-utilized asset--individuals' privately owned autos-- and stripped out the labor overhead that accompanies employment(and makes it expensive to employers).These moves transfer income to the owner of the distribution network (Uber, AirBNB, etc.) while offering a slice of income to the owner of the asset being monetized (the privately owned auto or flat).Whatever income security exists in this distribution of income goes to the owner of the distribution network (Uber, AirBNB etc.) rather than the owner of the asset that's being monetized.The labor component of the service is poorly paid and stripped of income security and other standard benefits: Uber drivers don't qualify for unemployment, disability, healthcare etc. unless they pay those very costly labor overhead expenses out of their own pocket.This model is under pressure on multiple fronts. Municipalities are starting to push back against the monetization of housing that's zoned for residential use only, and against the low wages and zero benefits paid to \"gig economy\" workers.In other words, it isn't just absurd IPO valuations that are suggesting this tech bubble is about to burst--the fundamentals of the business models and the deflationary impact of technology are about to reduce the cash flows and profits of tech companies.As for the fantasy that AI and machine learning will generate trillions in profits:as I explained inIs the World Becoming Wealthier or Poorer?[4](March 27, 2019) there is nothing intrinsically profitable about machine learning, robotics or AI. Rather, each is extraordinarily deflationary to profits as each is readily commoditized.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,[3] There are two other trends that don't attract quite the media attention that soaring profits do. Is the decade-long tech bubble finally popping?Tech bulls are overlooking the fundamental reality that the drivers of Big tech's phenomenal growth--financialization and expansion into mobile telephony-- are both losing momentum. </p><p>A third dynamic--Big Tech monetizing privately owned assets such as vehicles and homes-- has also reached saturation and is now facing regulatory barriers. Let's start with market saturation:of the 5.3 billion adults on earth over 15 years of age, 5 billion now have a mobile phone and 4 billion have a smartphone:The end of mobile[4](Benedict Evans). As for teens between 10 and 15, only the truly impoverished don't have a mobile phone of some kind. As I discuss below, the primary dynamic of the past decade has been the integration of web-based services into mobile telephony. By any measure, that cycle is now complete. Technology Is Not Just Disruptive, It's Disastrously Deflationary[5] The basic idea here is that the tech bubble has been inflated by a unique set of circumstances: -- financialization, one manifestation of which is unprofitable Unicorn companies going public at lofty valuations (see chart)  -- the establishment of quasi-monopolies that have become immensely profitable.  These conditions are changing. 1. Many tech giants (Microsoft and Apple) are moving to monthly services, in effect becoming profitable utilities. These may be profitable but they are no longer fast-growing in terms of revenues or profit margins.  2. Calls for regulation of lightly regulated data-based corporations (Facebook and Google) are rising.  3. The weakness of Lyft and Uber stocks after their IPOs suggest a weakening appetite for betting on growth at any cost as a business model.  4. The profitable build-out of the past decade has been integrating web services with mobile telephony and data-mining social media and search. These have now been built out, so the tech cycle has reached stagnation in the S-Curve--a reality visible in Google's recent earnings disappointment.  There are two other trends that don't attract quite the media attention that soaring profits do: 1. Previous tech cycles / bubbles were founded on technologies that had the potential to greatly boost productivity. This cycle ( integrating web services with mobile telephony) is more about consumer convenience and distribution of services such as AirBNB and Uber than productivity.  To the degree that entertainment and the addictive distractions of social media are now at everyone's fingertips, and people are checking their phones hundreds of times a day, productivity has suffered rather than increased.  2. The services that are now distributed to mobile telephony are tremendously deflationary to revenues and profits. To note just one example of many, with a smart phone in hand, there's no longer any need to buy a camera or portable music player.  More pernicious is the deflationary impact on revenues and wages. The number of Uber drivers who earn the equivalent of what taxi drivers once earned (no great sum in most cases) is small.  In effect, Uber monetized an under-utilized asset--individuals' privately owned autos-- and stripped out the labor overhead that accompanies employment(and makes it expensive to employers). These moves transfer income to the owner of the distribution network (Uber, AirBNB, etc.) while offering a slice of income to the owner of the asset being monetized (the privately owned auto or flat). Whatever income security exists in this distribution of income goes to the owner of the distribution network (Uber, AirBNB etc.) rather than the owner of the asset that's being monetized. The labor component of the service is poorly paid and stripped of income security and other standard benefits: Uber drivers don't qualify for unemployment, disability, healthcare etc. unless they pay those very costly labor overhead expenses out of their own pocket. This model is under pressure on multiple fronts.Municipalities are starting to push back against the monetization of housing that's zoned for residential use only, and against the low wages and zero benefits paid to \"gig economy\" workers. In other words, it isn't just absurd IPO valuations that are suggesting this tech bubble is about to burst--the fundamentals of the business models and the deflationary impact of technology are about to reduce the cash flows and profits of tech companies. As for the fantasy that AI and machine learning will generate trillions in profits:as I explained inIs the World Becoming Wealthier or Poorer?[6](March 27, 2019) there is nothing intrinsically profitable about machine learning, robotics or AI.   Rather, each is extraordinarily deflationary to profits as each is readily commoditized. * * * [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/gLYG9R7PldI/tech-bubble-bursting\">http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/gLYG9R7PldI/tech-bubble-bursting</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/gLYG9R7PldI/tech-bubble-bursting\">http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/gLYG9R7PldI/tech-bubble-bursting</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.com/2019/06/is-tech-bubble-bursting.html\">http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.com/2019/06/is-tech-bubble-bursting.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile\">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay19/tech-deflationary5-19.html\">https://www.oftwominds.com/blogmay19/tech-deflationary5-19.html</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oftwominds.com/blogmar19/world-wealth3-19.html\">https://www.oftwominds.com/blogmar19/world-wealth3-19.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PHIL1021261559830259912251761300067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIL-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8S-JTX1-JCMN-Y1B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><timeReceived>2:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Phil's Stock World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The Trump Administration is a \"difficult negotiating partner because it is divided on China goals.\" The Chinese were incorrectly led to believe that the U.S. trade hard-liners \"would be pacified by a few headline deals.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the Chinese currency since May has plummeted 8 percent against the dollar. The U.S. Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act was just enacted. Since 2016, Chinese investment in the United States has plummeted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's Chinese President Xi Jinping who, Scissors argues, \"has cultivated the image of another Mao rather than another Deng.\" Translation: A strong-man autocrat who is not a believer in liberalized markets.</p><p>Is Scissors correct that the U.S.-China relationship is about to permanently shrink? And if so, how will this change affect the global order, including currency relationships, relative levels of economic performance, and national security concerns?</p><p>Twenty distinguished global strategists consider the question.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, The White House</p><p>Is the U.S.-China trade relationship \"going to shrink,\" as the American Enterprise Institute's Derek Scissors argues? The answer depends on China's willingness to embrace the market-oriented reforms that it promised to undertake when it joined the World Trade Organization and fully commit more broadly to the principles--and practice--of free, fair, and reciprocal trade.</p><p>There can be no half measures here as the stakes are simply too high for America's future. President Donald J. Trump has made it clear he will no longer tolerate China's unfair trade practices, first and foremost its attempts to acquire America's technological crown jewels.</p><p>President Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy identified China for the first time as a strategic competitor, and the list of U.S. grievances in the technology space have been extensively documented in the landmark March 22, 2018, Section 301 investigation report published by the United States Trade Representative. Based on this and other public and government information, China's tactics to gain control of U.S. technology include forced transfer, state-directed and state-funded investment in cutting-edge U.S. tech companies, and the cyber-enabled and direct theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, and confidential business information.</p><p>In June 2018, the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy that I direct published a report entitled, \"How China's Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.\" This report assessed that China uses more than fifty unfair acts, policies, and practices that range from high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers to transshipment to evade United States antidumping duties. The bulk of these acts, policies, and practices are outside the norms of free and fair trade and disrupt not just the United States, but also the global economy.</p><p>The picture that emerges from the USTR's and the OTMP's analyses is that of a Chinese model that, by construction, derives much of its economic growth at the expense of other nations. The key question, of course, is to what extent China will be willing to give up its unfair trade practices in any \"deal\" in exchange for continued access to U.S. markets. In OTMP's assessment, a core problem is that even if China ceases engaging in many of the ways that it extracts jobs, technology, and wealth from the United States, there are still many more tools of economic aggression our businesses, workers, farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs would have to contend with.</p><p>This need not be a stalemate, the pessimism of Scissors notwithstanding, if China take serious steps to address its unfair trade practices. However, the Chinese side continues to deny that it engages in practices such as cyber intrusions and forced technology transfer--despite abundant evidence to the contrary.</p><p>At the end of the day, the question is this: Will China be willing to join the ranks of nations that embrace fair and reciprocal trade and live up to the commitments it made to the United States and the rest of the world when it joined the WTO? Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is finally calling China to task, and other countries should do the same. Do not be fooled by China's claims that it is the biggest defender of the multilateral trading system.</p><p>The American public and business community fully understand the challenge facing America's long-term competitiveness. After decades of taking advantage of the United States, there is now widespread public understanding that America is being cheated. There is also broad bipartisan support, as well as increasing cooperation amongst U.S. allies such as Japan and Europe, for standing up to China's behavior, particularly on issues related to technological transfer and state-owned enterprise behavior.</p><p>President Trump will do what must be done to defend this country. China must address these fundamental market barriers if it wants to continue to expand its economic relationship with us.</p><p>GARY CLYDE HUFBAUER</p><p>Nonresident Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute tor International Economics</p><p>Derek Scissors, part-time advisor to the Trump Administration, is known for prolonged animosity to China. His prediction that the U.S.-China relationship will permanently shrink is partly wish-fulfillment and partly forecast that Trump will be re-elected in 2020. Scissors may prove right, and if so that will prove two things: that the White House can turn a major country from adversary into enemy with truculent tariffs and Cold War rhetoric, and that Trump has more staying power than his many scandals might suggest. Given this prospect, the real question is whether America will gain or lose from shrinking economic ties to China.</p><p>My bet is that the United States will suffer as much as China. Two-way trade, while orders of magnitude larger than my tribe of Treasury mavens foresaw in the 1970s, still falls well short of its potential magnitude given the economic size of the United States and China. Expanding trade delivers huge supply-side benefits to both parties, through the workings of comparative advantage, economies of scale, the narrowing of mark-up margins, and faster adoption of best practices by laggard firms. Weak U.S. productivity growth, well under 1 percent a year, suggests that the United States needs these tonics more than China. If Alibaba is foreclosed from the U.S. market, who will compete with Amazon?</p><p>Two-way direct investment is surprisingly modest and the recently enacted FIRRMA bill, alongside Chinese investment restrictions, will ensure it stays that way. Research by Theodore H. Moran and Lindsay Oldenski shows that Chinese firms operating in the United States pay better wages and conduct more investment and research and development than average American counterparts. As China rapidly evolves from technology imitator to technology innovator, the United States will forego spillover benefits that could flow from the local presence of top-flight Chinese firms. Only a supreme nationalist could believe that U.S. firms will remain best-in-class in every dimension of technology over the next two decades. Yes, in many, but not in all.</p><p>Skilled immigration could be another casualty of the Scissors vision. U.S. college applications show the wealth of Chinese talent. If economic ties shrink, student visas may well be tightened, just like H1 -B visas, depriving the United States of highly promising scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Only Peter Navarro's acolytes will celebrate shrinking U.S.-China economic ties--if that's what the future holds. Other Americans should lament the multiple losses that could have become our economic gains.</p><p>JASON FURMAN</p><p>Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy, Harvard University's Kennedy School, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, and former Chairman, President's Council of Economic Advisers</p><p>The United States is clearly better off with an economic relationship with China than it would be without. Whatever problems the relationship has, losing access to an export market with 1.4 billion people would be a big loss for our economy and losing access to key intermediate inputs and final goods imports would be even worse. China is also better off with an economic relationship with the United States than it would be without, for much the same reason.</p><p>The mutual benefits from the economic relationship mean that there should be some bargaining equilibrium that is better for both countries than defecting. There is a strong case to be made that there is a bargaining equilibrium that would leave both countries better off than they are today. The United States wants China to hew more closely to international rules and norms on equal treatment of foreign investment, an end to forced technology transfer, stronger intellectual property rules, a reduction state subsidies, and the like. These may be exactly the steps China needs to take for its own domestic economic reasons.</p><p>Foreign companies are getting increasingly sick of uncertainty in China and are instead investing elsewhere--and when they invest in China they only bring and transfer the inferior technology. As China depends more on the accumulations of ideas instead of just raw capital, intellectual property rules will become increasingly important. Subsidies are increasing debt, especially for provincial governments, and distorting the economy toward the less efficient state-owned sector. In all of these cases, the U.S. demands may well be in China's economic interests--just as China's reformers used the cover of the World Trade Organization accession in 2000 to push for domestic reforms they would have wanted regardless.</p><p>Even if China has its own domestic reasons to agree to U.S. demands, however, it does not mean that it will definitely follow through. It may not realize the benefits of further reforms, they could be blocked by powerful interests, or just the appearance of giving in to a bullying United States could be too much.</p><p>The other possibility is that the U.S. demands are genuinely zero-sum and, as many Chinese policymakers believe, would only help the U.S. economy by forestalling China's continued rapid economic development. Even if this is true, there still should be a bargaining equilibrium that divides these wins and losses in a way that is superior to the even larger losses both countries would sustain from an extended economic war. But it would be much trickier to find this equilibrium.</p><p>In either case, it is important for both sides to come to a better understanding of their leverage. For China, that will require understanding that the problems it faces are not simply going to pass after President Trump's time in office is done but instead are widely shared in U.S. economic, business, and political circles--and by other countries as well.</p><p>For the United States, it will require understanding that its already finite leverage will only become more limited over time as the U.S. economy will represent a steadily smaller share of the global economy due to the substantially faster growth rates in economies that are still catching up, most notably China but other emerging markets as well.</p><p>I hope that a solution exists that would be better than the status quo ex ante for both. I am sure that a solution exists that would be better for both than the status quo ex post a major economic war. In either case, however, the challenge will be coming to an agreement around that solution.</p><p>JIM O'NEILL</p><p>Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, United Kingdom, and former Chairman, Asset Management, Goldman Sachs International</p><p>The very fact that this question is being asked suggests to me that there is something deeply troubling going on in the United States. In terms of the most simple answer, if the United States deliberately chooses to curtail its economic, trade, and investment relationship with China, then of course, it is quite likely that it will succeed.</p><p>But why would it do that? What is the likely benefit to the United States? Is the ego of senior policymakers and others so fragile that the very notion of another country having a larger U.S.-dollar nominal GDP than itself is seen as a threat? China (as well as India) has around four times more people than the United States, so unless China were to be in permanent weakness, it is quite likely a country of that size might become the largest economy in the world. But what is more concerning is some sort of presumption amongst some close to current U.S. policy that both this approach will help the United States, and along with it, the United States controls the global trade agenda. Both are highly questionable.</p><p>While China today is still only around 70 percent the size of the United States, in terms of relative change so far this decade, of all the increase in nominal global GDP, China is responsible for just over 49 percent of it. The United States is responsible for about one-third of it. Moreover, and what seems to be frequently lost by so many in the United States--except the boss of Apple--is that the Chinese consumer is increasingly driving most of their growth. On the same simple calculations, Chinese consumers have driven around one-fourth of the world's nominal GDP change this decade so far. Smart desirable international companies see this in their business, Apple being a particularly good example. Indeed more broadly, this is why China is now the third most important single export nation for the United States. For at least a decade, China has been more of a marginal driver of global trade than the United States. By the end of 2016, China--if you add total imports and exports--had already become Germany's number-one trade partner. Germany exports more to China than to its neighbor, Italy. For at least ten years, China has been Japan's number-one export market, despite their history. And I would imagine, in coming years, more and more countries around the world will end up with China as their number-one export market.</p><p>Another angle for the United States to think about is the difference between American and Chinese consumers. It is currently fashionable to believe that the United States is once again driving the world economy. The U.S. economy is cyclically very strong, but much of this is primarily because of the one-off consequences of a big fiscal stimulus, especially benefiting U.S. companies.</p><p>Beyond this, the United States is stuck with an economy where the consumer is more than 70 percent of its own GDP. This problem is what got the United States into the mess it endured during 2007-2008 when its highly leveraged housing market finally turned around. For much of the preceding twenty years, the world was driven by the U.S. consumer, and international economic policy meetings would justifiably worry about an alternative source, with Germany and Japan usually regarded as possible, desired candidates. Due to their own aging, and lack of policy flexibility, we all know they never materialized to be that force. What is so odd about the timing of this Trump-led aggressive stance on China is that it comes when there is such clear evidence that the Chinese consumer is performing that role. As anyone who travels anywhere can tell, anecdotes of the aspiring Chinese consumer are everywhere, including among sellers of any modern telephone or other technology devices. If the United States had policymaking advisors that thought about their own twenty-year future, I reckon they would pretty quickly focus on the fact that to sustain anything close to 3 percent real GDP growth, maybe anything more than 2.5 percent, they will need investment spending and exports to be more important. And quite simply, without an important consumer elsewhere, it is tough to see this.</p><p>Maybe the bigger gripe is China's \"Made in 2025\" strategy. But while the United States could cite World Trade Organization rules as to why China shouldn't strategically subsidize domestic growth industries, it is a bit difficult for the United States to do this while so openly doubting most of the fashioned rules of international trade of the past thirty or more years, including the WTO. And in any case, as it relates to U.S. opportunities, Chinese success in achieving its long-term ambitions, including ranking the growth of its own consumer as the major priority in the past two five-year plans, should get more attention.</p><p>So I am not sure about Derek Scissors' predictions. They can become true if U.S. policymakers want them to, but surely the real issue that leading U.S. think tanks should be focusing on is why on earth would the United States have such pessimistic ambition and goals?</p><p>JOSEPH E. GAGN0N</p><p>Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics</p><p>It was inevitable that the rapid economic development of a country as large as China would cause major disruptions to the rest of the world. Whenever economic change creates winners and losers, it is the losers who grab the headlines. In the United States, China's rise has contributed to job losses, widening income inequality, and divisive politics, as many areas of the country feel left behind.</p><p>Going forward, China will not return to the large trade surpluses of ten years ago, nor should the rest of the world allow it to do so. They were the unintended result of an excessive focus on nominal exchange rate stability that led to massive currency manipulation. Issues related to intellectual property, including cyber theft, pirating, and forced technological transfer dominate the agenda. For its own sake, China should improve its behavior, and an agreement in this area ought to be possible.</p><p>State-owned enterprises pose a tougher problem. President Xi has made it clear that he wants to enhance the role of SOEs. My colleague Nick Lardy has shown that SOEs in China are getting favorable access to capital despite falling profitability. Private companies inside and outside of China face unfair competition from SOEs that do not have to face a market test for survival. The world needs to decide how to deal with this threat to the trading system. The Trans-Pacific Partnership made a start but much more needs to be done, including within the broader World Trade Organization.</p><p>The world has a right to set the terms on which China engages in trade. But it is folly to think that the United States, even with allies, can prevent China's rise. The only thing that can stop China becoming the world's largest economy is China's own government. Any attempt by the United States to impede China's rise will only generate ill will. Moreover, it would not be worthy of the example set by past decades of enlightened U.S. policy that encouraged economic development around the globe. We all benefit from a stable and prosperous world.</p><p>Besides confronting China, the United States needs to decide whether it wants to remain open and engaged with the world. The alternative path of tariffs and protection would ossify the U.S. economy and allow the rest of the world to eventually surpass it. Far better for the United States to compete in the world economy, keeping its firms at the forefront of efficiency. But we need to go beyond half-hearted trade adjustment assistance and institute broad training and jobs programs, along with partial wage insurance, to smooth the path back to productivity for workers who suffer from economic disruptions of any type.</p><p>Finally, the United States should recognize that it has the tools to correct its longstanding trade deficit without resort to harmful tariffs that have little effect on trade balances anyway. Two actions are needed: First, reverse the massive and ill-advised fiscal stimulus that is sucking in more imports. Second, adopt a balanced dollar policy that guides the exchange rate to a level consistent with balanced trade. Such a policy could be supported by stabilizing intervention in foreign exchange markets aimed at reducing imbalances. Or it could be supported by a modest tax on capital inflows.</p><p>YUEN YUEN ANG</p><p>Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Michigan, and author, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap (Cornell University Press, 2016)</p><p>The idea that the United States and China are two fundamentally incompatible powers is not a fact, but a belief. To be precise, it is a dangerously self-perpetuating belief. This point is so important that it deserves to be repeated three times: Beliefs make reality. Beliefs make reality. Beliefs make reality.</p><p>As American policymakers now believe that China is a \"revisionist power\" and fundamental threat, they respond by containing China, as we now see in the ongoing trade war. Such antagonistic actions confirm long-held beliefs among Chinese citizens that America is bent on undermining their country, leading to inflamed nationalist sentiments that inadvertently strengthen autocratic rule, further deepening fear among Americans. In other words, what we see unfolding is a self-reinforcing cycle of escalating tensions that began with a perception of incompatible interests.</p><p>How did America arrive at such a perception in the first place? Is it possible for the United States and China to escape the so-called Thucydides Trap? If there is any hope for de-escalating current tensions, understanding the causes of misperceptions and correcting them is the first place to start.</p><p>Both the United States and China share responsibility for the current stand-off. On the American side, antagonism toward China arises from a convergence of international and domestic insecurity. On the global stage, America is unnerved by the decline of its status as the preeminent superpower; at home, it faces rising discontent from working-class Americans who failed to benefit from globalization and capitalism. In his campaign to \"Make America Great Again,\" President Trump tapped into both sources of insecurity. China becomes a natural object of blame.</p><p>On the Chinese side, President Xi's \"authoritarian revival\" alarmed Western observers, who are now convinced that China not only will not liberalize as the economy grows but is becoming more autocratic than before. The abolition of term limits, crackdown on political freedoms, and revival of Maoist ideology have led the West to see China today as the antithesis of democracy. The clash is not only over interests but values.</p><p>This clash of values is exacerbated by an image of Chinese global ambition. China's grandiose Belt and Road Initiative and rapid outward investment in just the past few years, bolstered by an inflated sense of confidence in China's rise among some Chinese elites and capped with authoritarian revival at home, add up to a sharp image of China in the West as both autocratic and aggressive. Seen through this lens, every action in China, from industrial policy to promoting technology, appears threatening.</p><p>In fact, American and Chinese interests are far from incompatible. The two economies are inextricably interdependent. Politically, there is common ground in values, too. As I've argued in my essay in Foreign Affairs, the political foundation of China's economic dynamism since market opening is not simply autocracy, but \"autocracy with democratic characteristics.\" China needs to understand, communicate, and most importantly, maintain the \"democratic characteristics\" in its political system, as they are crucial not only for the country's economic future, but for convincing America that China is not its arch nemesis.</p><p>RICHARD N. COOPER</p><p>Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics, Harvard University</p><p>If President Trump follows through with his threats to increase tariffs on all or most goods from China, if China retaliates, and if he uses his new authority to restrict Chinese direct investment in the United States, there will certainly be a shrinkage of direct economic engagement between China and the United States. But will it be permanent? And will there be a shrinkage of indirect economic linkages, via third countries? And will national security relations \"shrink,\" whatever that might mean? The answer to these three questions is most likely negative, unless the American public becomes much more isolationist than it is at present.</p><p>The higher tariffs will set back both China and the United States, but both will continue to grow over time, although China at lower rates than in the past, mainly for demographic and other reasons attenuating the reasons for high past growth. Europe and Japan (and Russia) are in relative decline, also for mainly demographic reasons, so China and the United States (and possibly India) will dominate national economies two decades from now. Their economic engagement will grow over that period of time, although less robustly than in the past two decades.</p><p>Capital is mobile enough internationally such that after a period of adjustment, both Chinese firms and U.S. firms will move to third countries, where labor is still cheap and education is rising, so indirect engagement (collaboration as well as competition) will occur in other parts of the world. The bilateral U.S.-China trade deficit may well fall, as Trump wishes, but it will shift to other low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh and Mexico, determined as it is by a deficiency of U.S. national saving--including the growing federal budget deficit, about which Trump does not seem concerned-relative to investment in the United States.</p><p>China has to make many changes, including introducing full convertibility and a fair and impartial system for dispute settlement, before other countries will be willing to embrace the Chinese yuan as an international currency; the U.S. dollar will remain the dominant international currency for the next two decades. But its position will be eroded as others perceive U.S. abuse of this position in imposing sanctions on other countries, led by Russia, Iran, and now Europeans who are really ticked off by Trump's repudiation of the joint agreement on Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>In future, the two countries will be the two dominant military powers on their current trajectories. They will have to engage, albeit warily, to preserve peace in the world. What transpires in the next few years will depend heavily on whether they can collaborate in denuclearizing North Korea, a stated objective of both, and on whether as part of a successful deal American forces will be gradually withdrawn from South Korea. But even then they will have to be engaged elsewhere in the world, possibly collaboratively (as in peacekeeping) but even to avoid accidental conflict.</p><p>RICHARD JERRAM</p><p>Chief Economist, Bank of Singapore</p><p>The U.S. relationship with the world is set to permanently shrink--has already shrunk--and that with China is particularly exposed. President Trump's transactional approach--tolerated by Congress--has undermined faith in America's commitment to the postwar order and this will not be easily repaired. Whether the focus on China is due to perceived economic injustice, efforts to contain a rising superpower, or some more base prejudice is questionable, but the effect is the same. The bilateral relationship will bear the brunt as the United States turns inwards.</p><p>At the same time, China's relationship with the world will grow, reflecting its rising economic power and more confident leadership. This will be accelerated by America's withdrawal. Where this leaves Europe is unclear--too preoccupied by internal strains to fill the gap left by the United States, but wary of rising Chinese influence.</p><p>It seems unlikely that we will return to the \"containment\" policy of the Cold War era, simply because the United States no longer seems to be interested in providing leadership. This is evident across Asia. When the United States walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it confirmed earlier suspicions of fading commitment. We can also see it in Africa, where growing Chinese involvement, under the guise of its Belt and Road scheme, is being met with U.S. indifference.</p><p>However, there are echoes of the Cold War in growing resistance to Chinese acquisition of Western technology--in Europe as well as the United States--in recognition of the deeper rivalry that is emerging. The West belatedly seems to have woken up to the fact that China has no intention of becoming a liberal democracy as its economy develops. This could even unwind the \"peace dividend\" of the 1990s, when U.S. defense spending halved as a share of the economy, which is something the federal budget can ill afford after the huge fiscal giveaway at the start of the year.</p><p>There are no plausible substitutes, but we will increasingly need to question the role of the U.S. dollar as America disengages from the world. The search for alternatives will intensify and its dominance will naturally fade, even though this will be a very long-term project.</p><p>C. FRED BERGSTEN</p><p>Senior Fellow and Director Emeritus, Peterson Institute for International Economics</p><p>The rate of growth of U.S.-China trade and financial interaction will undoubtedly decline, as indeed it already has. The rapid burst of trade expansion as China boomed and integrated with the world economy was unsustainable and has already slowed considerably. Both countries have become increasingly cautious about further increases in their dependence on each other, for security as well as economic reasons. The cutback in the growth of investment flows, particularly of direct investment, has been even sharper as those concerns have accelerated in both the United States and China.</p><p>There may even be a reduction in the absolute level of economic interaction for some period. The current and proposed U.S. tariffs and Chinese countermeasures, if fully implemented, would clearly produce such a result. Trump wants to cut imports from China to reduce the bilateral imbalance. China, which is moving away from reliance on the market more broadly, wants to cut its dependence on the U.S. economy. These short-term shifts may lead to re-orientation of corporate investment strategies and supply chains that will have a lasting and reinforcing impact in a similar direction.</p><p>It is not clear that such developments would result in a reduction in the economic relationship between the United States and China, however. The management of the posited conflict will itself require extensive interaction between the authorities of the two countries, drawing on the extensive network of consultations and working groups that has built up over the past several years, if damaging trade and investment wars are to be averted.</p><p>Moreover, both countries will maintain a keen interest in the effective functioning of the global economy and will recognize that their cooperation is essential for it to prevail, whether on exchange rates or WTO reform. They will presumably want to avoid the further erosion of their relationship that could accelerate the onset of a new Cold War. The escalation of bilateral trade and investment conflict could thus paradoxically lead to an intensification of systemic cooperation between them.</p><p>The most constructive response to the current U.S.-China impasse would in fact be a renewed effort by the two countries, perhaps in broader regional and multilateral contexts, to seriously address the structural issues that lie at the heart of their confrontation. China could join the effort already initiated by the European Union, Japan, and the United States to reform the World Trade Organization, including to cover subsidies provided to state-owned enterprises and rejection of forced technology transfers.</p><p>China could join, and the United States could rejoin, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (now comprising the eleven other founding members) to work out new rules for intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment. The United States and China could pursue a bilateral trade or investment agreement first and then attempt to broaden its main features to their closest trading partners.</p><p>Whatever the technique, the goal would be to expand rather than narrow the relationship between the two economic superpowers--on which the world economy as a whole now relies so heavily--even if the actual level of economic interaction declines.</p><p>MOHAMED A. EL-ERIAN</p><p>Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz; Contributing Editor, Financial Times, Columnist, Bloomberg Opinion, and Chair, President Obama's Global Development Council</p><p>Is the U.S.-China economic relationship about to permanently shrink? Not necessarily, but it will change significantly.</p><p>For years, the strategy of successive U.S. administrations had been to entice China to be a more responsible stakeholder in the international economy and the global trading system. To this end, it used many more carrots than sticks. All this changed with the election of President Donald Trump. His \"America First\" mantra has translated into a bigger emphasis on tariffs, overwhelming what had been a traditionally much more cooperative approach.</p><p>While sudden, this change has been long in the making.</p><p>Amplified by China's impressive rise to join the very small club of systemically important global economic and trading powerhouses, there has been a steady buildup in the list of genuine grievances about China's proper adherence to the letter and spirit of the international rule-based system. This includes concerns pertaining to such issues as the theft of intellectual property, the proliferation of non-transparent bilateral payments agreements, and the terms accompanying the sizeable loans extended by Beijing to a growing set of developing countries.</p><p>Where we go from here is increasingly bimodal, and notably different from the status ante. What is certain is that, with a better trade tone developing between the United States and its western allies and a higher likelihood of a more coordinated approach towards China, the Chinese government and companies should brace themselves for greater pressure.</p><p>If readily accepted by the United States, timely trade concessions from China--particularly on intellectual property and joint ventures requirements--would lead to a still-free but fairer trade system. They could enhance the countries' role as twin engines of the global economy, open the way for beneficial international spillovers, reduce the risk of future financial instability, and provide a bigger window for the beautiful normalization of monetary policy in advanced countries. And they could even improve prospects for the much-needed reform of multilateral institutions and lower the risks associated with twin technology poles.</p><p>A continued tariff tit-for-tat, along with the expansion of threats and counter-threats, would increase the risk of a damaging global trade war and even its possible extension to finance given that China is a major holder of U.S. Treasuries. This would further fragment the international economic system, increase the risk of systemic financial instability, and, in the case of China, threaten the derailment of an internal economic consensus that is essential for avoiding the middle-income development trap.</p><p>How this increasingly bimodal distribution of possible outcomes develops depends in large part on the negotiating skills, agility, and open-mindedness of trade negotiators and high-level political interactions. It is in the interest of both countries, and of the global economy as a whole, to work together to address the imperfections of--and modernize--the global trading and institutional system.</p><p>JEFFREY R. SHAFER</p><p>Former Undersecretary for International Affairs, U.S. Treasury</p><p>A stronger trade and investment relationship between the United States and China, built on fair market-oriented rules, would deliver tremendous benefits to both countries and the wider world. Gains from trade would be realized. Competition would bring out the best in both countries' business communities. Cross-border investment would rationalize supply chains and optimize the development and use of new technology. And agreement to strengthen and abide by rules regarding development credits would provide real benefits to recipients.</p><p>Benefits would transcend the economic. Close economic and financial engagement would restrain both countries from actions that threatened peace and security. The two most powerful countries for a long time to come will be less confrontational and take fewer risks if the benefits from a strong economic relationship are at risk.</p><p>The U.S.-China relationship is at risk today. Attention has focused on the Trump Administration's trade and investment actions. If it were just Trump's policies, the Chinese side and those in the United States who support a strong economic relationship could hang on until a change in leadership. But other, more fundamental, developments are threatening the relationship.</p><p>Three constituencies in the United States have turned against building closer relations with China. Most important is the U.S. business community, which long supported increasing trade and investment with China. Frustration with market access, stolen or extorted intellectual property, investment restrictions, the China 2020 policy of protection, and the lack of follow-through on the reform pledge made at the third plenum of 2013 to allow the market to play a decisive role has depleted this support. Workers and the communities affected by declining industrial employment have become more active opponents of engagement with China. This opposition has become a powerful political force even though China trade is a less important factor in job loss than productivity, and the period of greatest dislocation is a decade behind us. And those in the United States who hoped for and saw for some time a rising trend of personal freedom in China associated with its taking its place in the global system have been disappointed by recent suppression of even mild dissenters.</p><p>Chinese unhappiness with the U.S. economic relationship has also grown. The United States has for some time engaged in hypocrisy--advocating for markets while putting up bars to investment and trade that go beyond any reasonable national security justification. The hypocrisy has intensified, and we now have a campaign of tariffs, undermining the decisive role of markets in the economy.</p><p>Both countries are now engaging in limiting visas for those who would engage in valuable exchanges.</p><p>Turning the tide will not be easy, but it is critically important. It must start with intense engagement of business people and thought leaders to generate public support for engagement. Some reengagement should be possible even before strong pro-engagement constituencies are rebuilt once a U.S. administration is in place that is willing at least to test the waters. For example, negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty would create a basis for addressing issues on both sides and making progress with the support of business in the two countries.</p><p>China and the United States will be economic rivals. It is critical for this rivalry to be played out in markets, not in government interventions. Only then will the benefits of engagement be realized.</p><p>JENNIFER LIND</p><p>Associate Professor, Dartmouth College, and Associate Fellow, Chatham House</p><p>Observers typically rely on two lenses to understand the current U.S.-China trade war. One lens focuses on the specific menu of predatory Chinese practices--tariffs, barriers to foreign direct investment, forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, and so on. This lens analyzes these practices and their effects on the U.S. economy; it assumes that the trade war will end when the two countries negotiate some sort of compromise, which will return bilateral relations to their previous uneasy but generally functional state.</p><p>People also view the trade war through the lens of domestic politics. This lens focuses on the populist wave that swept the United States and propelled Donald Trump into the presidency. According to this lens, Trump-and his misguided, zero-sum views about international economics--caused the trade war. Once the Trump Administration is a thing of the past, the trade war will end, and we can all \"go back to the way it was.\"</p><p>These two lenses are both important, but incomplete. One cannot understand the U.S.-China trade war without a geopolitical lens. A predictable feature of international politics is that periods of great-power rise are tense and dangerous--indeed, historically, they have often led to wars. Tensions mount as a rising power grows into a system in which the powerful countries have written the rules; increasingly the rising state has the power to assert its interests, and to renegotiate those rules. And, understandably, the powerful countries try to defend the rules that they set up according to their preferences and interests.</p><p>Such is our world today. China has moved from a poor, weak, isolated country to one of the world's largest economies and manufacturing powerhouses. Formerly an economy that assembled products designed by others, China is steadily moving up the value chain and rising in the ranks of the world's most innovative countries.</p><p>As China grows more capable, Beijing is seeking greater authority in the forums that dictate the rules of the road in international politics and economics. It is also launching initiatives and institutions of its own (such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and others). In the security realm, China is more assertively advancing and defending territorial claims, and increasingly refusing to tolerate the U.S. military presence in East Asia.</p><p>The geopolitical lens reminds us that periods such as this--periods of great-power rise and relative decline--have always been tense, and often violent. The trade war is but one symptom of much larger forces at work. Namely, we are seeing a wholesale renegotiation of relations between China and the world, and particularly China and the United States: two great powers determined to advance their national interests. In not only the realm of trade, but across the many realms in which these two countries interact, this process will be fraught and dangerous. Assuming China's rise is not derailed by a major internal crisis, there is no going back to \"the way things used to be.\"</p><p>ROBERT A. MANNING</p><p>Senior Fellow, Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security, Atlantic Council</p><p>Derek Scissors correctly observes that the Trump Administration is \"divided on goals.\" Witness the U.S. trade deficit with China actually rising in 2018 to record levels even as tariffs kick in. Trump tax cuts, record budget deficits, and a strong dollar suggest high trade deficits, making Tramp's preoccupation more problematic, whatever sort of managed trade is needed to achieve it. Trump considers himself the ultimate dealmaker. But the logic of Trump trade policy is to pressure U.S. firms to bring manufacturing home, leaving China. Tariffs and rising labor costs have led some to do so. Some key advisors seek economic separation from China, others prefer a deal for reciprocal market access--if possible.</p><p>There is widespread agreement in the United States, the European Union, and Japan that core U.S. grievances against China, as detailed in the USTR Section 301 report, are really about technology-centered, state-driven industrial policies--China trying to own the future by hook or crook. Actions include stealing intellectual property, coerced technology transfer as a condition for foreign investment, predatory mercantilism, and digital protectionism (my favorite oxymoron is \"internet sovereignty\"). Beijing's \"Made in China 2025\" industrial policy seeking to dominate ten key technologies in itself might not be a problem. Indeed, it is modeled on Germany's \"Industrie 4.0\" plan. It is the massive subsidies and banning of foreign competition to create national champions that is over the top.</p><p>The current state of affairs reflects both a U.S.-China bilateral relationship and a global trade regime overtaken by the breakneck pace of China's growth--from $1 billion in GDP in 1999 to $11.2 trillion in 2016. This reality plus China's gaming the system whose rules and standards treated China more like a developing nation than the second-largest economy and largest global trading power exposed flaws in the global trade regime and cost millions of American jobs, catalyzing a backlash against globalization.</p><p>Avoiding a trajectory of economic separation will require China to acknowledge its status as a more mature economy and rethink its predatory mercantilism. For the United States, it means taking yes for an answer. What does that mean? For China, it would mean living up to its stated goal of having the market play \"a decisive role\" in the allocation of resources. That means halting coercive tech transfer practices and massive subsidies to create national champions, easing its digital protectionism (for example, restricting commercial data flows, no foreign ownership of clouds, no private VPNs, and so forth). At present, Xi Jinping's actual policies point in the other direction--more backing for state-owned enterprises, and more Chinese Communist Party control of everything, including boards of Chinese and foreign firms, and demanding Chinese Big Tech--Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent--sell shares to the CCP, among other things. In short, a blurring between the private and state sectors.</p><p>For the United States, it would mean a common approach with the European Union, Japan, Australia, and other OECD nations to reform and modernize the World Trade Organization. Fixing the dispute settlement mechanism and toughening rules on state-owned enterprises and subsidies could provide leverage to rebalance U.S.-China economic ties based on reciprocity and transparency on trade and investment. Like U.S. Big Tech, China's version also wants access to global markets, and sees themselves increasingly cut out of Western markets, as investments are denied and leading Chinese firms like Huawei are banned from operations puts pressure on Xi. Trump would have to accept economics and live with a large trade deficit, albeit smaller, as China will buy perhaps $100 billion more in U.S. goods and services.</p><p>Such a scenario now appears a chimera. Tariff wars will get worse until a tipping point is reached. But the costs to the United States, China, and the global economic system of not eventually finding a modus vivendi will be astronomical.</p><p>CATHERINE L. MANN</p><p>Managing Director and Global Chief Economist, Citigroup</p><p>The current bout of trade and investment tensions likely will accelerate trends that were already in place. These trends will shrink the trade relationship but may deepen at least some financial relationships between the United States and China. Further strains may arise amid a deeper financial relationship and an attenuated trade relationship.</p><p>Trade integration likely will erode because both countries are large, relatively closed economies with rising services shares and differences in approaches to the digital economy. Although services are not \"non-traded,\" they are more local, and there has been little progress in either plurilateral or multilateral negotiations on opening markets for tradeable services. There is no appetite in the current context to push for deeper or broader trade in services.</p><p>Trends in the United States include the relatively lower share of consumer goods in the shopping basket of both millennials and retirees, which tends to shrink the bilateral trade relationship as a share of GDP. Trends in China include a moving on-shore of supply chains to increase domestic value-added, which likely will accentuate the decline in bilateral trade. Although the tertiary sector in China doubled over the last two decades as a share of GDP to around 50 percent, the services share of trade stalled.</p><p>With regard to digital trade, differences in attitudes towards the interrelationships among digital industries, government, and society were balkanizing cross-border information flows even before the recent tensions, and there was little prospect for agreement on these fundamental dimensions even before the current tensions arose.</p><p>Turning to financial relationships, some financial relationships are likely to shrink, but others may deepen. In terms of foreign direct investment, U.S. FDI into China already had started to sag as firms increasingly realized the difficulties of developing and then keeping markets in China. On the other hand, China's FDI investment in the United States was roaring ahead, until arrested by the current tensions.</p><p>FDI is not the only kind of financial investment. Integration via portfolio and debt finance show diverging trends that are driven by diversification motives. U.S. investment into China has increased with the Stock and Bond Connects, the inclusion of China in the MSCI index, and investors' desire to diversify their holdings to include exposure to China. On the other hand, China's outflow of capital has been increasingly constrained, limiting the direction of financial integration and diversification. For official finance, China's diversification motive may encourage an effort to reduce bilateral financial integration away from U.S. Treasury securities even as the inclusion of the RMB in the SDR basket could increase the desire for that currency.</p><p>The upshot of both trends and current policies are likely to shrink the trade relationship even as some financial relationships deepen between the United States and China. How that divergence between trade and finance plays out remains to be seen.</p><p>WILLIAM BROCK</p><p>Former United States Trade Representative and former U.S. Secretary of Labor</p><p>It may very well be that the total exchange of goods and services between United States and China will fall in the reasonably near term. I do not expect this to continue for an extended period of time, and certainly not on a permanent basis. Interestingly, while the economic value of a productive relationship is, or should be, compelling to most, political concerns in both countries appear to be surging. Those concerns have risen dramatically in this country, and for good reason.</p><p>In the years since China gained accession into the World Trade Organization, its commitments have not been kept. Worse, it is now clear that China seems determined to avoid its international responsibilities as a principal trading partner. State-owned enterprises continue to receive government support, whether they are capable of productively engaging in a competitive market environment or not. Unequal treatment of investment and intellectual property on the part of U.S. firms reflects the decision of China's business and political leaders to ignore equitable practices carefully developed and consistently refined by industrial nations over the course of many years. The list of these interventions and other negative actions is long and sad. The need for a global response is abundantly clear.</p><p>The U.S. government has demonstrated a willingness to take on this challenge. I might argue that the instrument chosen, significant tariffs without consultation, much less coordination with our fellow industrial nations and trading partners, is at best, risky, and at worst, dangerous. Pursued unilaterally, it will pose a threat to unity with those nations, which joined our efforts over these many years to construct a productive global trading system with equitable rules and an honorable dispute settlement mechanism.</p><p>There is scant evidence of such unity. Our failure to insist on remedial changes, and our failure to organize and lead a determined coalition, has left China with little incentive to behave constructively. Chinese abuses have created a problem that is real, and it is serious. Left unaddressed, it will represent a major threat to the most effective instrument of world growth in all recorded history, the global trading system which has created the opportunity for billions of individuals to escape the desperate extremes of poverty.</p><p>While the present mutually counterproductive governmental interventions will not soon go away, the extraordinary costs these interventions will impose on each country may quickly prove unsustainable. There is every prospect these imperatives will pull each nation's leaders to the bargaining table. Yes, they will be determined to advance their own nation's well-being, as they should. Even so, only the construction of a bilateral relationship with clear and enforceable rules and procedures within a global system of rules and procedures to resolve disputes will allow each country to advance its own interests and thereby advance their mutual interest. Will there be challenges and abuses? Of course. Even so, the long-term prospects for U.S.-China trade are positive. We have no choice. Nor does China.</p><p>ANDREW DEWIT</p><p>Professor, School of Economic Policy Studies, Rikkyo University</p><p>The U.S.-China relationship will continue to shrink, though whether \"permanently\" is anyone's guess. And the confrontation is about industrial policy rather than the confused trade balance metrics cited by President Trump and his immediate circle.</p><p>Team Trump should read Cormac McCarthy's No Country For Old Men and ask, \"If the rule you followed brought you to this [trade war], of what use was the rule?\" Blustering will not make the Chinese abandon their \"Made in China 2025\" high-technology policy. China will almost certainly continue to use non-market mechanisms, including industrial spying and subsidies, to achieve that aim. After all, the Americans did much the same to the British, as Peter Andreas details in his Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America. And Mariana Mazzucato's The Entrepreneurial State shows us that the Pentagon paid for much of the basic research that led to American leadership of the Internet and other advanced technologies. China's strategy is hardly novel, but the speed and scale of their success is.</p><p>So one can sympathize with America. The myriad implications of losing technological leadership are understandably unnerving for a polity that has been number one for over a century. And no one likes cheaters, especially a China whose ethos seems averse to a sustainable and liberal globalism.</p><p>America has plenty of options in addressing the China challenge. But tragically, it appears committed to the most futile and disruptive--indeed dangerous--course of action. It imposes escalating demands on the Chinese, demands whose rationales vary depending on which talking head pops up from the top ranks of the White House. And simultaneously, the administration alienates the Canadians, Europeans, Japanese, and other allies it needs to build a credible strategy. The liberal and globalized order is collapsing apace, as President Trump wantonly chops away at the norms, ties, and treaties that are its pillars.</p><p>America could be the biggest loser in this protracted struggle. Read \"China: A Visit to the Epicenter.\" Henry McVey and Frances Lim make a compelling case that China can absorb the shock of this trade war through accelerating its technological development and regional supply chains. The Chinese have surely read Jeffrey Sachs' A New Foreign Policy: Beyond American Exceptionalism, particularly his assertion that American pressure on an emergent Japan in the 1970s and 1980s led to the latter's capitulation, and thus the lost decades.</p><p>Someone's going to shape most of the emerging global regime as well as the infrastructures of an urbanizing planet. Over the next couple of decades, new and vastly smarter cityscapes will comprise, in aggregate, an area the size of Spain and trillions of dollars in business. China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative has its hiccups, but is backed by disciplined, strategic vision. At present, America lacks the patience and alliances to pose a potent challenge. One key indicator of this reality is seen in how Japanese shipping and other concerns are repositioning themselves to ride the technocratic tiger rather than fly over the cliff with the featherless eagle.</p><p>DIANA CHOYLEVA</p><p>Chief Economist, Enodo Economics, and co-author, The American Phoenix and Why China and Europe Will Struggle After the Coming Slump (2011)</p><p>The world economic and political order is undergoing a tectonic shift, as the rules of engagement between the existing superpower, the United States, and the aspiring superpower, China, are being rewritten. There has been a sweeping bipartisan change in American attitudes towards China while the Middle Kingdom under Xi Jinping has abandoned Deng Xiaoping's doctrine of \"Hide your strength, bide your time.\"</p><p>A dangerously underappreciated aspect of this all-encompassing geopolitical confrontation is the critical role played by China's integration into the world trading system after it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. This was a factor contributing to the global financial crisis, discrediting the Washington Consensus doctrine of liberal economics, and undermining the West's confidence in the superiority of the free market.</p><p>The crisis was not the result of failing free markets, and \"greedy bankers\"--the popular scapegoat--played only a tangential part. Rather, it was a consequence of the clash between two distinctly different economic systems within a global trade and financial framework largely set to serve liberal markets.</p><p>China was welcomed into the WTO on the premise that its model would converge with the Western template, and it duly made great strides in modernizing its economy. But its progress was an odd construct: it was predicated on grabbing export market share and opening some parts of its economy to market forces, while keeping the cost of borrowing and energy under strict control, pegging its currency to the dollar, and not allowing the free movement of capital.</p><p>Bolting China's semi-command economy onto America's free markets resulted in a huge build-up of debt in America that ushered in the financial crisis. But U.S. profligacy was not the proximate cause of the meltdown. The culprit was China's serious deficiency in domestic consumer demand, which led it to accumulate vast savings that it had to export. The upshot was that China was willing to throw money at the United States at next to no cost. For the United States, this was an offer that it would have been too rude to refuse.</p><p>This thesis is far from commonplace, yet the economic rationale behind it could not be more clear-cut. It is based on the well-known national accounting identity that saving must ultimately equal investment. If the fundamental driver was America's desire to borrow and spend, this had to be matched by extra saving, which, in mm, needed to be induced by higher interest rates globally. But if China's excessive desire to save was the driving force, what was needed was lower real interest rates in order to induce the extra investment. We all know what happened to inflation-adjusted rates around the world, so the direction of causation is clear.</p><p>It is extremely important for both the United States and China to understand this dynamic. Beijing has genuinely, but prematurely, concluded that its top-down semi-command economic model is superior. For its part, America has spent too long since the crisis beating itself up: there was very little its policymakers could have done under the current global economic and financial framework to prevent the catastrophic build-up of domestic debt.</p><p>The Sino-American relationship has never been a marriage of convenience. Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick could not have been more wrong in 2007 when they argued that \"so long as both sides discern the benefits of their remarkable economic marriage of convenience, Chimerica--and the global asset boom it has created--will remain a reality and no mere chimera.\" The chimera all along has been the idea that there could be a symbiotic relationship between the world's largest market economy and its largest command economy. Unless the two systems had fused together, there is no way the rules of engagement could have stayed the same.</p><p>ATMAN TRIVEDI</p><p>Managing Director, Hills and Company, and Adjunct Fellow, Pacific Forum</p><p>The United States and China are steadily moving down a path of economic estrangement. That road most likely leads to a gray area between the economic division of the Cold War and the high degree of bilateral connectivity characterizing the last decade. Reversing this deteriorating relationship depends on a newfound Chinese willingness to revisit their fundamental economic approach, as well as the quality and competence of leadership in Washington and Beijing.</p><p>Near-term economic ties are fraying as both governments use the wrong tools to achieve growth and prosperity. China's state-directed industrial strategy, forced technology transfer and investment rules, systemic IP practices, and joint venture requirements are threatening the competitiveness of U.S. companies.</p><p>The Trump Administration is correct in its diagnosis of the problems with China, but the liberal use of tariffs is no substitute for a strategy. The ongoing trade war is unlikely to force significant and lasting changes to the country's approach. Even if China's economic vulnerabilities are not overstated, Beijing's own political imperatives make a humiliating climbdown unlikely.</p><p>Less public than the trade war, yet also consequential, is the loss of bilateral investment flows. From the first half of 2017 to the first half of this year, Chinese investment in the United States plummeted over 90 percent--and these figures don't reflect the recent law passed by Congress (with China top of mind) to tighten scrutiny of foreign investment in critical, defense-related technologies. At the same time, U.S. investment in China is encountering new regulatory attention that sometimes results in preferential treatment of domestic businesses.</p><p>Whether or not the discord is short-lived hinges on a number of factors. At least in theory, the United States and China share economic interests in achieving prosperity through trade, reducing inequality, and improving quality of life for the middle class.</p><p>But the Chinese government's role in driving the economy and the scale of its activities produces an unfair advantage. These trends appear to be headed in the wrong direction: growing Chinese Communist Party intervention in business, increasing government investment in state-run firms, and a reduced state appetite for open markets.</p><p>Beijing should understand that Washington's tolerance for the economic status quo is diminished in both political parties. A few tweetable deals that increase U.S. exports won't address concerns. This flinty attitude took shape towards the end of the Obama Administration and reflects a growing consensus that talks have not yielded enough change.</p><p>Without demonstrable progress, hardening views on China within the administration, Congress, and the establishment make a costly, long-term economic separation more likely. The American business community traditionally has provided ballast with China during rocky moments. But it has expressed growing disappointment with Beijing's policies that limit their opportunities.</p><p>Both countries see each other's trade policies as part of a comprehensive effort to achieve commercial and military hegemony. This mutual mistrust also produces an environment in which finding common ground on economic issues becomes more complicated, requiring wise and adroit leadership. Can Xi lead less like Mao and more like Deng? And can Trump (or his successor) and Congress learn from past mistakes and rebuild domestic support for a different approach with China?</p><p>Perhaps after each inflicts some more unnecessary pain on the other, one proposal that might find common ground is working to build a stronger, reformed World Trade Organization. Economist Yukon Huang has outlined how rules curtailing nonmarket assistance to state-run companies and removing restrictions on foreign participation in joint ventures could alter China's behavior. In September, the European Commission tabled a proposal for revamping the WTO. If the White House can continue to mend trading ties with Europe and other traditional allies, it may still be able to rally them behind a more robust WTO better equipped to deal with China's state-driven economy. That, of course, will require the administration to abandon counterproductive efforts to undermine that institution and weaken its rules.</p><p>The stakes are high: Further economic decoupling would slow growth in both countries, contribute to a global economic downturn as supply chains shift, inflict collateral damage on allies, and increase the likelihood of heightened security competition destabilizing Asia. Given the risks, let's hope the mounting costs of trade and investment barriers lead cooler heads to prevail.</p><p>CRAIG ALLEN</p><p>President, U.S.-China Business Council, former U.S. Ambassador to Brunei Darussalam, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for China, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce</p><p>Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute is an astute observer of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. But he paints an unnecessarily dark, even dystopian, view of the future.</p><p>While there are hardline voices in both Washington and Beijing calling for a \"decoupling\" of the bilateral relationship, these represent extreme views that overlook history, the dynamism of the current bilateral relationship, and America's strategic role in the world.</p><p>America has benefited from trade and investment in China since our founding. English tax on Chinese tea was the proximate cause of the Revolutionary War in 1776. Americans first settled both California and Hawaii, in part, as a platform to expand U.S. exports to China. Bilateral trade, immigration, and investment with China have been a permanent part of the American experience since the very first days of America's founding.</p><p>Currently, U.S.-China bilateral trade and investment employ some 2.6 million Americans. In the city of Shanghai alone, there are more than four thousand American-registered foreign-invested enterprises. American exports to China have grown almost every year so that China has become our second-largest export market after Canada. In addition, American companies produce American-branded products in China in the amount of almost $500 billion. USCBC members operating in China are generally both profitable and optimistic about the China market.</p><p>The Chinese economy remains quite robust, despite the movements of its stock markets. In the first half of 2018, China's economic growth exceeded 6.8 percent. Job growth is strong. Investment is strong. The Chinese government of course faces many economic problems, such as growing debt. However, we should not underestimate China's macroeconomic management capabilities. The Chinese government has many tools at its disposal to ensure continued macroeconomic stability and economic growth.</p><p>Moreover, the consequences of an effective decoupling of the U.S.-China relationship are dire. Are American companies to forego the benefits of participating in the world's most rapidly growing emerging market? Can the United States really re-shore global supply chains when we have a 3.8 percent unemployment rate--among the lowest in the last twenty years? Can our alliance structures in Asia--and indeed the entire global economic architecture--withstand a sustained U.S.-China separation? If so, will anyone win?</p><p>The U.S.-China relationship is certainly under stress. The Trump Administration has rightly called out China for its failure to implement WTO obligations and its sustained aggressive techno-nationalism. These are serious problems. But they should be considered as multilateral problems that are best addressed by multilateral engagement with diplomatic allies. We do not need to decouple. We need to work with our allies to engage China so that China fully lives up to its WTO obligations and works with us to upgrade the WTO. In that way, everyone can continue to enjoy the obvious benefits of global supply chains, collaborative problem-solving, and regional stability.</p><p>HONGYI LAI</p><p>Associate Professor, School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham</p><p>With President Trump's imposition of tariffs on $200 billion worth of China's imports in September 2018, U.S.-China relations have entered a new period of uncertainty. Although it is difficult to predict how long this period will last and whether this is the start of a prolonged economic cold war, populist leadership on both sides seems to reduce the likelihood for a satisfactory resolution of the disputes.</p><p>Trump sees \"fair trade\" as a key to his pledge to make America great again. He tries to repay his loyal supporters by materializing his presidential campaign promise of getting tough on China and rectifying what he perceives as China's failure to protect U.S. intellectual property rights, open up its markets, and end excessive subsidies to state firms. China's President Xi Jinping, on the other hand, would likely associate resistance to foreign intrusion with his dream of Chinese national revival and see defending China's \"legitimate economic rights\" as key to his political legitimacy. He would like to demonstrate to the Chinese public that he is strong enough to stand against the American bullies who willfully use their predominance in global market shares, the financial system, and top layers of the value chains to pressure trade partners into submission. At a deeper level, while Trump sees the end of Chinese government aid to firms--especially state firms--to foster technological innovation as essential to a trade deal, Xi sees this as a sinister attempt to choke off China's drive toward sustainable growth. Many analysts believe that China could weather this trade war despite heavy losses through the state's tight monitoring of media, social media, and protests, and through portraying Trump as the whimsical perpetrator of this economic crisis. Top leaders' power consolidation, vision, and skills, as I argued in my 2010 book, have thus driven U.S. and Chinese foreign policy.</p><p>If the trade war is not resolved or contained, it could spiral into financial, intelligence, military, and political areas. Even if the U.S.-China trade dispute is resolved in a way less disruptive than a tariffs war, an overwhelming American negative reaction caused by their perception of China's unfair trade practice and unfree state capitalism, life-time autocrats, and assertive diplomacy much increases the chance of perpetual confrontation with China.</p><p>Trade war has already inflicted economic pains on the middle-class citizens who hold the listed stocks, as well as exporting firms in China. While the U.S. economy seems strong, dynamic, and robust at the moment, a protracted war will create side effects not only in China, but also in the United States. In the longer run it could raise prices for consumer goods and imported production inputs, dampen investment and consumption, disrupt supply chains, and may encourage divestment in order to avoid tariffs. Decelerated growth and decreasing demand for imports in these two largest economies could reduce the growth of economies exporting to them. Trade partners of the United States might also feel that the U.S. failure to resort to multilateral or reform initiatives undermines rule-based procedures in the global economic system.</p><p>Scissors Responds</p><p>U.S.-China disengagement will likely continue and expand.</p><p>DEREK SCISSORS Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute</p><p>I do not speak for any part of the U.S. government. My views on China started to shift sixteen years ago, when pro-market economic reform first ebbed. This is the single most important reason for the partial separation of the American and Chinese economies: Beijing has long abandoned the pro-market path and shows no true interest in returning to it.</p><p>There are other factors, of course, including President Trump recently leading a protectionist tilt in the United States. It would be foolish to predict a permanent or necessarily all-encompassing disengagement stemming from such factors. But disengagement will be multi-dimensional and protracted, and indeed has already begun.</p><p>Those anticipating Chinese reforms to permit more commercial competition and strengthen private property rights have been wrong for at least a decade. There have been policy changes that can be termed reforms, but they have sought to limit competition with state-owned enterprises and repeatedly failed to enhance private property rights. The much-hyped Communist Party Third Plenary meetings in late 2013 have proven empty, as some discerned at the time.</p><p>China's frequently predatory trade behavior follows easily from its domestic policy. If state-owned enterprises must be sheltered from competition, genuinely open trade cannot be tolerated. If domestic private property rights are limited, why would foreign intellectual property be protected? Claims that the Sino-American relationship can thrive are based on false beliefs that China is reforming consonant with being a better partner, or hopes that it will do so. The time to re-expand bilateral economic relations is only when such hopes are realized.</p><p>Politics argue strongly for separation, whatever one's preferences. In the United States, Trump's razor-thin electoral margin in 2016 may have stemmed from sharp criticism of open trade. The signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement leaves the PRC as by far his top target. For their part, Democrats have criticized Trump for being too lenient with China and have a protectionist constituency in labor unions. On the other side of the Pacific, General Secretary Xi's intention to remain in power indefinitely leaves no reason to expect better policy in 2022.</p><p>Disengagement has been and will be uneven. It is well-known by now that Chinese direct investment in the United States has plummeted, and fresh investment by American companies in China is comparatively small. However, American portfolio investors could become more exposed to the PRC through their international holdings, whether they are aware of this or not.</p><p>Related, Sino-U.S. technology cooperation is shrinking and will continue to shrink. In this, the much-discussed changes in U.S. investment review made in the last National Defense Authorization Act were secondary to a tighter export control regime in the same document. The Trump Administration is further tightening export controls through executive action.</p><p>Moreover, it's likely that Chinese researchers and students will be barred from additional advanced technology research projects on American university campuses. This is a reasonable step, but extending bans to Chinese students beyond technology is not reasonable. Gary Hufbauer's association of me with attacks on people-to-people movement in his comment is inaccurate. Two-way people movement should be preserved as much as possible, which makes China's tighter visa issuance and restrictions on foreign non-government organizations especially harmful.</p><p>Goods and services trade, despite the gnashing of teeth, does not yet show disengagement. Volume grew in 2017 and the first half of 2018. The 10 percent U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods are minor and the scheduled jump to 25 percent on the first day of 2019 as well as tariffs Trump promised on remaining imports from China both remain in doubt. Trade volume as a share of U.S. GDP was 3.7 percent in 2017, versus 1.2 percent in 2001. If it merely holds the present level, disengagement will remain limited.</p><p>This, however, is just phase one. Trade expansion has brought trade deficit expansion. Given candidate Trump's extremely strong language during 2016, the bilateral deficit is an enormous target for Democrats in 2020. Barring surprising changes from the PRC, trade and two-way people movement will be under more fire eighteen months from now than they are today. Ideally, the United States and China would tackle internal problems such as debt accumulations, then reconsider economic relations. More likely, the separation process will stagger forward.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-569457430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 569457430</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6N-CVR1-JCBJ-K3SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Economy Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>The International Economy</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0898-4336</issn><volume>Vol. 32</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 22, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Banking, finance and accounting industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International economic relations</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>International economic relations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially announced its USD5bn fine on Facebook, for having violated its 2012 Order; Facebook will also need to create a new privacy structure as well as a new compliance system. This comes as no surprise, as we had recently highlighted how the US was looking to regain the tech regulatory leadership from the EU, but questions remain whether the US will go as far as its European counterparts.Driven by bipartisan consensus, there has been a shift in the US discourse when it comes to Big Tech, towards greater regulatory scrutiny. This in itself is a return to a more traditional antitrust vision, focusing not only on prices and consumer harm, but also on consumer choice. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> case of the late 1990s has shown that the fear of greater scrutiny in itself, without any structural remedies, can have a positive impact on competition and innovation in the market. </p><p>We have already argued that only the US could break the tech companies should it wish to, but recent developments in Europe suggests a more radical approach when it comes to pure regulation.The DoJ announcement on the review was very vague, so we do not yet know which aspects will be focused, whereas the FTC fine, while large in absolute terms, is not relative to Facebook's size, and does not come with strict conditions attached regarding its future behaviour. The February decision by the German Federal Cartel Office, restricting Facebook's ability to collect data on multiple platforms, would have a greater impact on the company's business model, and with a recent investigation into Amazon, the EU is clearly moving towards seeing data as a competition issue. The FTC focuses on privacy and compliance, but not on what data can be collected and to what purpose, which is what some European regulators are looking into. Some are even proposing making the tech giants open up their data sets, or creating a new specific tech regulator, which is part of the proposed Digital Services Act, with regards to illegal content. These will be moves akin to breaking up the largest players. While greater scrutiny is a positive move, the US needs to make its vision clearer, especially with regards to data, and not just hope that the threat of enforcement will lead to more competition and innovation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: Bundeskartellamt's Decision To Impact Facebook's Business Model', February 8 2019;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Regulation Part Of Global Tech Battle', June 12 2019; and,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'US Domestic Politics Crib Sheet: Gridlock To Persist As 2020 Election Season Gets Into Swing', July 2 2019.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMTEIN-1477387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMTEIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS7-3N41-JD33-J50C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">323177</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially announced its USD5bn fine on Facebook, for having violated its 2012 Order; Facebook will also need to create a new privacy structure as well as a new compliance system. This comes as no surprise, as we had recently highlighted how the US was looking to regain the tech regulatory leadership from the EU, but questions remain whether the US will go as far as its European counterparts.Driven by bipartisan consensus, there has been a shift in the US discourse when it comes to Big Tech, towards greater regulatory scrutiny. This in itself is a return to a more traditional antitrust vision, focusing not only on prices and consumer harm, but also on consumer choice. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> case of the late 1990s has shown that the fear of greater scrutiny in itself, without any structural remedies, can have a positive impact on competition and innovation in the market. </p><p>We have already argued that only the US could break the tech companies should it wish to, but recent developments in Europe suggests a more radical approach when it comes to pure regulation.The DoJ announcement on the review was very vague, so we do not yet know which aspects will be focused, whereas the FTC fine, while large in absolute terms, is not relative to Facebook's size, and does not come with strict conditions attached regarding its future behaviour. The February decision by the German Federal Cartel Office, restricting Facebook's ability to collect data on multiple platforms, would have a greater impact on the company's business model, and with a recent investigation into Amazon, the EU is clearly moving towards seeing data as a competition issue. The FTC focuses on privacy and compliance, but not on what data can be collected and to what purpose, which is what some European regulators are looking into. Some are even proposing making the tech giants open up their data sets, or creating a new specific tech regulator, which is part of the proposed Digital Services Act, with regards to illegal content. These will be moves akin to breaking up the largest players. While greater scrutiny is a positive move, the US needs to make its vision clearer, especially with regards to data, and not just hope that the threat of enforcement will lead to more competition and innovation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Articles</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Quick View: Bundeskartellamt's Decision To Impact Facebook's Business Model', February 8 2019;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'Regulation Part Of Global Tech Battle', June 12 2019; and,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">'US Domestic Politics Crib Sheet: Gridlock To Persist As 2020 Election Season Gets Into Swing', July 2 2019.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1477387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HPV1-JD33-J0PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Since the 1990s we have been gifted an increasingly sophisticated suite of apps and services such as the ability to share photos with hundreds of people in an instant, use GPS maps and store unlimited\u00a0emails - all for free.</p><p>The implicit value exchange is that in return for these modern conveniences we have allowed the companies to harvest and monetise our data. Over the last couple of decades we have generally become more inured to this initially painless transaction.</p><p>Facebook has been one of the principal beneficiaries of the big data gold rush and last year the company alone accounted for just under <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43474760\">20 per cent of the total US digital ad market</url> .</p><p>Its success was based on convincing its two billion users to voluntarily create forensic advertising profiles of themselves via their activity on the platform. Every time they\u00a0posted or liked a page they gave Facebook, and by extension its advertisers, another valuable glimpse into who they are.</p><p>Facebook's youth problem                   </p><p>Apart from its current controversies and the threat of regulation, Facebook has been facing a far more\u00a0worrying trend in recent years: Young people are deserting it for rival platforms.</p><p>According to a report by eMarketer released last month the percentage of 12- to 17-year-olds on social media using Facebook in the UK dropped from more than 90 per cent in 2014 to 71 per cent in 2018. By 2022 the company predicts that figure could drop as low as 66 per cent.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43474760\">Facebook users by age group (12-17)</url></p><p>Meanwhile Facebook's rival Snapchat continues to gain ground with teenage users. Although Snapchat's overall user numbers are still dwarfed by Facebook (187 million daily users compared to Facebook 1.4 billion), it presents an alarming trend for Facebook and asks if the company that has thus far utterly dominated the social media landscape is now\u00a0losing the battle for the future?</p><p>                   Millennial decline                   </p><p>Like most of her friends, Sara Berkai, a 22-year-old student at University College London, has a Facebook account, but the platform is far from her first choice when she's thinking of sharing something on social media.</p><p>As with many\u00a0of her generation she joined Snapchat not long after its inception in 2011. The attraction was simple, she could share photos and posts instantly, knowing they would not become part of a permanent record of her behaviour.</p><p>\"The attraction was instant photos that last for 10 seconds and then disappear,\" she said \"If I take a photo of the food I am eating I don't need that to last.\"</p><p>Sara had been on Facebook since her early teens and as such it had become an unwanted and forensic record of her juvenilia and \"embarrassing Twilight posts\". As she left to study Information Management for Business at university its potential embarrassment turned to concern as she feared that future employers would someday see her teenage musings.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43474760\">Facebook by numbers</url></p><p>Many of her friends have since combed through their profiles, deleting most of their youthful posts. Yet Snapchat swapped that uncomfortable permanence for an intimate ephemerality that allowed them to communicate in a much more natural way.</p><p>It also gave her more control over who saw her posts by allowing her to send Snaps to select friends or post to a 24-hour story. The app also let her know exactly who had viewed any of her Snaps.</p><p>Snapchat tapped into one of the biggest vulnerabilities of Facebook: In a world where every post is permanent and broadcast to wide audience, people tend to be much more circumscribed about what they share.</p><p>                   Messaging apps and Instagram                   </p><p>That desire for more control and intimacy has also seen an explosion in messaging apps that allow users to create groups which reflect their differing social circles.</p><p>Sara said that when she has something she wants to post she often turns to groups on Facebook-owned WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. These again let her tailor the audience she is sharing with.</p><p>However her favourite social media platform is Instagram, which is again owned by Facebook. Her account is private meaning all her followers have been okayed by her before they can view her posts.</p><p>In recent years she says she has moved away from Snapchat and more towards Instagram as the latter has adopted the ephemeral stories\u00a0feature\u00a0of the former, but also has a \"better UX\".</p><p>Snapchat's dogged emphasis on creating small intimate social circles by separating celebrity accounts from friends has also pushed her towards Instagram as she is keen to follow public figures and YouTubers she likes.</p><p>\"With Instagram I like the stories\u00a0feature, tagging people and following people you like and find interesting,\" she said.</p><p>                   The platform of record\u00a0                   </p><p>Even if Facebook is losing popularity with younger users in countries like the UK and US, they seem to be flocking to other platforms it owns, as well as Snapchat.</p><p>While Snapchat has continued to be a thorn it its side, it is far from posing an existential threat to Facebook.</p><p>Also, while Facebook proper is now not always the first choice for younger millennials when they are thinking of sharing something on social media, it still plays a pivotal role.</p><p>Sara said Facebook was still the first place she saw the big life announcements from friends, such as them announcing their gap year travels.</p><p>She also said it was the place she went to post content she was happy to share with a broad and familiar audience, such as photos from\u00a0family events. Facebook was no longer the place where she posted everything, as in her teenage years. But it is still the social media platform of record for her life and as such maintains an indispensable role.</p><p>Sara adds: \"With work colleagues nobody adds each other on Facebook, we all have each other's Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook seems more intimate.</p><p>\"But I don't think this is the death of Facebook\".</p><p>                   The future of social media                   </p><p>Facebook's current troubles have thrown a spotlight on just how powerful it has become. The cumulative effect of hundreds of millions of people sharing their intimate data on the site means it can not only attract\u00a0an unprecedented pile of ad revenue but can also move votes and sway elections.</p><p>The controversy with Cambridge Analytica has renewed concern about how it handles the vast trove of data it collects, but it shows little sign of convincing people to leave en masse. Essentially, giving up personal data\u00a0to use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp et al for free is a value exchange many are still willing to make.</p><p>For years Facebook has seemed unassailable, squashing or acquiring any challengers that emerged. Snapchat capitalised on a generational shift away from permanence and towards intimacy and has proved a stubborn outlier from Zuckerberg's domain.</p><p>Yet Snapchat has had its own struggles of late, with its share price <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43474760\">struggling since its IPO</url> last year and user growth disappointing some investors.\u00a0</p><p>The number also speak for themselves. While Snapchat and Twitter have around 300 million monthly users each, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger have more than 5.7 billion combined.</p><p>While Facebook may not be the obvious go-to for\u00a0younger millennials as it was for their older peers, that is more reflective of greater diversity of platforms we have today.</p><p>The future of social media is more fragmented, more intimate and gives users much more control over\u00a0who they broadcast to as well as the data footprint they leave behind. As such Facebook probably won't dominate the next decade in the total fashion it\u00a0did the last.</p><p>But Facebook still has a key USP in that milieu as the platform we go to broadcast our most important moments and stay connected. And even if we do delete Facebook, chances are we'll just migrate to another corner of its empire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-42494680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-W1T1-F021-655D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000754</classCode><className>FORENSICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But many investors are starting to make comparisons with the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and asking how long these sky-high valuations can continue to hold sway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of 2015, the market capitalisation of the S&amp;P 500 has increased by $6 trillion (\u00a34.8 trillion). Of this, $4 trillion has come from the big six tech names: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Netflix. Such is their dominance that they account for almost a quarter of the US stock market. On their own, the big six have a larger market capitalisation than any other non-US stock market apart from China's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Part of this dominance is down to the fact that tech stocks' valuations have run way ahead of the market as a whole. The technology-rich Nasdaq index is now trading on a valuation of about 31 times earnings, compared with about 21 for the S&amp;P 500. Microsoft is on a valuation of 31 times future earnings while Amazon is on a stratospheric valuation of 125 times earnings.</p><p>Tesla, the maker of electric vehicles, last week overtook Toyota to become the world's most valuable carmaker. The California-based company, which is commonly regarded as a tech stock, is now worth almost $206bn - $3bn more than the Japanese automaker - after its shares hit a new high of more than $1,200.</p><p>There are certainly some very strong echoes of the prevailing atmosphere of the dotcom bubble of 20 years ago. Then, as now, the US Federal Reserve was creating a lot of excess liquidity as it calmed the market after the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, which in turn almost brought down financial markets.</p><p>The abundance of cheap money fuelled investment in speculative internet and tech companies and that prompted a rush of stock market flotations, many of which collapsed in the dotcom bust of 2000 as monetary policy started to be tightened. The liquidity taps were opened again with quantitative easing following the financial crash of 2008 and this has helped to fuel the dramatic rise of the current group of tech giants.</p><p>Billions of pounds of investors' money is flowing into technology funds as investors seek to cash in on the tech boom. This week Polar Capital has restricted the amount of money going into its top-performing Global Technology fund - a process known as soft closure - after it grew by \u00a31.6bn to \u00a34.5bn in three months.</p><p>There are significant differences between the two periods, according to Jason Hollands from the wealth manager Tilney. \"At the height of the dotcom bubble, many of the most fashionable stocks had unproven models and were burning investors' cash on advertising, unlike today where the tech and communication services sector is dominated by substantial and hugely profitable businesses with global reach that have diversified into many areas,\" he said.</p><p>In the dotcom bubble the IPO market overheated. In 1999 there were 486 floats on the US stock market. Last year there were 159. The other notable difference is that private investors are nowhere near as involved today as they were then, when flotations such as lastminute.com caught the public imagination.</p><p>Hollands said: \"Great companies deserve to trade at a premium. However, the higher the price you pay for a stock, the less margin for error you have if things don't go as well as you assumed. The recent advertising boycott of Facebook is just one example of how such businesses are not invulnerable and big tech is facing backlashes from governments and greater scrutiny from tax authorities and regulators.\"</p><p>As advertisers dropped out of Facebook its stock price fell about 11%, although it has since recovered half of these losses. There is also increased scrutiny of digital businesses around the globe, which is likely to grow.</p><p>The big technology stocks did not achieve their dominance by accident, however. They are flexible, digital businesses that can control costs, maintain their services and fulfil customer demand even in the current tough conditions. They don't require a lot of capital because their worth lies in intellectual property and (with the exception of Netflix) they have strong balance sheets.</p><p>They have a net cash pile of $212 billion, a figure that has barely changed since 2014, even though they have spent $450 billion in dividends and share buybacks since then. This has been made possible by their robust profit margins, averaging 17.7% in 2019, and strong free cash flow that amounts to a total of $485 bn since 2014.</p><p>Russ Mould from the investment manager AJ Bell said \"Companies generally falter because clients get fed up with them and seek an alternative, or rivals move in, attracted by their bounteous margins, cashflow and returns on capital. While Netflix probably faces the greatest number of new rivals, the others still look difficult to dislodge from their perches, at least without a push from the regulator.\"</p><p>It is competition with each other that possibly poses the greatest threat to their businesses, as evidenced by Facebook's launch of its Shops service, which puts it in direct competition with Amazon.</p><p>That is not to say that there are not tech stocks which do look overvalued. Nikola Motor, a maker of trucks powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, listed on the Nasdaq on June 4 and the shares went from $33 to $80 in days. At its peak the market cap was about $28 billion - not bad for a company whose forecast revenues for 2021 are $150 million.</p><p>Despite the high valuations, there remains an appetite among investors. Tech stocks are expected to grow their earnings by an impressive 27% in 2021 and 18% in 2022, that will bring the price to earnings ratio - a key measure of valuation - down from 35 to a considerably cheaper 23.5 in two years' time.</p><p>The nature of tech stocks has also changed. Jeremy Lang, the co-founder of Ardevora Asset Management, said: \"The quality growth stocks we hold in the tech sector have become so entwined in the way businesses are run that they appear more like a safe utility than an unpredictable growth stock.\"</p><p>Douglas Brodie, the manager of the Edinburgh Worldwide investment trust, said that the coronavirus crisis had acted as a catalyst for a massive acceleration of technological adoption.</p><p>Mould said: \"Alphabet and Facebook are encountering a squeeze on ad revenue and regulation is still a possible source of difficulty. Amazon is set to be hauled before Congress to explain how it uses data, and Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are still looking over their shoulders over prior disputes with the taxman, anti-trust regulators or privacy campaigners.</p><p>\"Having six stocks represent 25% of the S&amp;P 500 does not seem healthy to me. It is too reminiscent not so much of 1999 but of the so-called Nifty Fifty US stocks of the early 1970s, which were seen as the ultimate safe harbour, only for them to tank, like everything else, in the bear market of 1973-74.\"</p><p>Hollands said: \"Most investors will probably find they already have sufficient exposure to these companies in their global and US funds. I would be cautious about running out to pile extra cash into specialist tech funds in the present environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

But many investors are starting to make comparisons with the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and asking how long these skyhigh valuations can continue to hold sway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of 2015, the market capitalisation of the S&amp;P 500 has increased by $6 trillion (\u00a34.8 trillion). Of this, $4 trillion has come from the big six tech names: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Netflix. Such is their dominance that they account for almost a quarter of the US stock market. On their own, the big six have a larger market capitalisation than any other non-US stock market apart from China's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Part of this dominance is down to the fact that tech stocks' valuations have run way ahead of the market as a whole. The technology-rich Nasdaq index is now trading on a valuation of about 31 times earnings, compared with about 21 for the S&amp;P 500. Microsoft is on a valuation of 31 times future earnings while Amazon is on a stratospheric valuation of 125 times earnings.</p><p>Tesla, the maker of electric vehicles, last week overtook Toyota to become the world's most valuable carmaker. The California-based company, which is commonly regarded as a tech stock, is now worth almost $206bn - $3bn more than the Japanese automaker - after its shares hit a new high of more than $1,200.</p><p>There are certainly some very strong echoes of the prevailing atmosphere of the dotcom bubble of 20 years ago. Then, as now, the US Federal Reserve was creating a lot of excess liquidity as it calmed the market after the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, which in turn almost brought down financial markets.</p><p>The abundance of cheap money fuelled investment in speculative internet and tech companies and that prompted a rush of stock market flotations, many of which collapsed in the dotcom bust of 2000 as monetary policy started to be tightened. The liquidity taps were opened again with quantitative easing following the financial crash of 2008 and this has helped to fuel the dramatic rise of the current group of tech giants.</p><p>Billions of pounds of investors' money is flowing into technology funds as investors seek to cash in on the tech boom. This week Polar Capital has restricted the amount of money going into its top-performing Global Technology fund - a process known as soft closure - after it grew by \u00a31.6bn to \u00a34.5bn in three months.</p><p>There are significant differences between the two periods, according to Jason Hollands from the wealth manager Tilney. \"At the height of the dotcom bubble, many of the most fashionable stocks had unproven models and were burning investors' cash on advertising, unlike today where the tech and communication services sector is dominated by substantial and hugely profitable businesses with global reach that have diversified into many areas,\" he said.</p><p>In the dotcom bubble the IPO market overheated. In 1999 there were 486 floats on the US stock market. Last year there were 159. The other notable difference is that private investors are nowhere near as involved today as they were then, when flotations such as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url> caught the public imagination.</p><p>Hollands said: \"Great companies deserve to trade at a premium. However, the higher the price you pay for a stock, the less margin for error you have if things don't go as well as you assumed. The recent advertising boycott of Facebook is just one example of how such businesses are not invulnerable and big tech is facing backlashes from governments and greater scrutiny from tax authorities and regulators.\"</p><p>As advertisers dropped out of Facebook its stock price fell about 11%, although it has since recovered half of these losses. There is also increased scrutiny of digital businesses around the globe, which is likely to grow.</p><p>The big technology stocks did not achieve their dominance by accident, however. They are flexible, digital businesses that can control costs, maintain their services and fulfil customer demand even in the current tough conditions. They don't require a lot of capital because their worth lies in intellectual property and (with the exception of Netflix) they have strong balance sheets. They have a net cash pile of $212 billion, a figure that has barely changed since 2014, even though they have spent $450 billion in dividends and share buy-backs since then. This has been made possible by their robust profit margins, averaging 17.7% in 2019, and strong free cashflow that amounts to a total of $485 bn since 2014.</p><p>Russ Mould from the investment manager AJ Bell said \"Companies generally falter because clients get fed up with them and seek an alternative, or rivals move in, attracted by their bounteous margins, cashflow and returns on capital. While Netflix probably faces the greatest number of new rivals, the others still look difficult to dislodge from their perches, at least without a push from the regulator.\"</p><p>It is competition with each other that possibly poses the greatest threat to their businesses, as evidenced by Facebook's launch of its Shops service, which puts it in direct competition with Amazon.</p><p>That is not to say that there are not tech stocks which do look overvalued. Nikola Motor, a maker of trucks powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, listed on the Nasdaq on June 4 and the shares went from $33 to $80 in days. At its peak the market cap was about $28 billion - not bad for a company whose forecast revenues for 2021 are $150 million.</p><p>Despite the high valuations, there remains an appetite among investors. Tech stocks are expected to grow their earnings by an impressive 27% in 2021 and 18% in 2022, that will bring the price to earnings ratio - a key measure of valuation - down from 35 to a considerably cheaper 23.5 in two years' time.</p><p>The nature of tech stocks has also changed. Jeremy Lang, the co-founder of Ardevora Asset Management, said: \"The quality growth stocks we hold in the tech sector have become so entwined in the way businesses are run that they appear more like a safe utility than an unpredictable growth stock.\" Douglas Brodie, the manager of the Edinburgh Worldwide investment trust, said that the coronavirus crisis had acted as a catalyst for a massive acceleration of technological adoption.</p><p>Mould said: \"Alphabet and Facebook are encountering a squeeze on ad revenue and regulation is still a possible source of difficulty. Amazon is set to be hauled before Congress to explain how it uses data, and Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are still looking over their shoulders over prior disputes with the taxman, antitrust regulators or privacy campaigners. \"Having six stocks represent 25% of the S&amp;P 500 does not seem healthy to me. It is too reminiscent not so much of 1999 but of the so-called Nifty Fifty US stocks of the early 1970s, which were seen as the ultimate safe harbour, only for them to tank, like everything else, in the bear market of 1973-74.\"</p><p>Hollands said: \"Most investors will probably find they already have sufficient exposure to these companies in their global and US funds. I would be cautious about running out to pile extra cash into specialist tech funds in the present environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Politicians ramp up plans to harness tech monopolies in a bid to maintain a fair, competitive market</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Elizabeth Warren hopes to turn Big Tech on its head with a proposal to split up the major players. \"Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't exist,\" Warren wrote in an article for Medium on March 8, 2019. \"Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It's a great story\u2014\u200abut also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The timely announcement of Warren's proposal became a hot topic at South by Southwest Interactive earlier this month where politicians, tech entrepreneurs and journalists weighed in on the prospects of her plan. Roger McNamee, founder of tech and media company Elevation Partners and also an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, said Warren's plan was \"brilliant\" and expressed his support on stage.</p><p>But not everyone was convinced. \"I think it's going to take a more nuanced proposal,\" said Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom during his SXSW keynote. \"My fear is that a proposal to break up all tech is playing on everyone's current feeling of anti-tech rather than doing what politicians should do, which is address real problems and give real solutions.\"</p><p>Media network the Verge attempted to think through what a more nuanced proposal would look like, exploring the practical considerations required to break up tech giants during a panel discussion at SXSW. \"How would you break up Google?\" asked Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge. The conversation ultimately ended with a comparison to AT&amp;T: in 1982, US regulators disbanded the company to break up its monopoly and allow room for competition, but lack of economic regulation ultimately allowed AT&amp;T to recentralize. \"That's the natural tendency of these companies,\" says Patel, \"to not compete. They don't want to.\"</p><p>Despite skepticism of Warren's radical approach, the general consensus was that clear action needs to be taken swiftly to control the fast-growing tech giants. During her session at SXSW, Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner of Competition, discussed the responsibilities large tech companies should be taking and the need for government to protect active and free competition. \"We're trying to make the marketplace work and be fair and competitive,\" said Vestager, \"but with tools that are not as far-reaching as breaking up the companies.\" Speaking on behalf of her upcoming plans for the European Union, Vestager reflects on how her team of regulators have worked toward more accountability and why \"breaking up Big Tech\" is the last resort.</p><p>\"We're dealing with private property,\" said Vestager. \"Businesses that are built and invested in and become successful because of their innovation. To break up a company, to break up private property, would be very far-reaching. And you would need to have a very strong case that it would produce better results for the consumers in the marketplace than what you could do with sort of more mainstream tools.\"</p><p>If the solution to control these tech goliaths is not by breaking them up, then what is the viable solution? The answer from the politicians speaking at SXSW seemed to point towards a changing tax system. Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Margrethe Vestager all agree that the current system is not sustainable. \"If you're big, you also have a special responsibility,\" says Vestager, \"and that's a responsibility not to do things that will make it impossible for others to compete against you.\"</p><p>Source: JWT Intelligence</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/13/155340279447.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/13/155340279447.jpg</url></p><p>Is this the end for Big Tech?<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/86/155340279771.png\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/434/1381/86/155340279771.png</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MDAVME-140901320</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MDAVME2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-9DG1-F11P-X40N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 World of Media JLT Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Bye Bye petrol station.'</p><p>Another added: 'Brilliant service, so handy and efficient, definitely will be using them again.'</p><p>But one unhappy user said: 'Waste of time left over an hour to tell me that I am outside their delivery zone.</p><p>'System is flawed if it allows a postcode that is outside to place an order.</p><p>'Don't waste your time trying and just use a petrol station.'</p><p>Mr Reda, who came up with the idea after running out of fuel in central London in 2016, said: 'We are also developing an exciting project with one of the major vehicle manufacturers to bring our service to all their car owners.</p><p>'We aren't able to reveal details yet, but it's going to be very exciting: Think Blade Runner meets Formula 1.'</p><p>LocalGlobe partner Suzanne Ashman Blair added: 'Not only are Reda, Romain and the team addressing the urgent and growing blight of congested and polluted cities, by delivering fuel directly to drivers, but at scale they can help transform the way cities work.</p><p>'They can help London become the first global city to eliminate petrol stations altogether and create a virtuous circle whereby the more people they serve, the more unnecessary journeys to petrol stations they can eliminate and the more they can reduce CO2 emissions.</p><p>'This is especially true with corporate customers, when an entire commercial fleet can be filled up in their depot, at night, with a single visit from one of Zebra's refuelling vans.'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>While the concept of having fuel delivered to your door - or your car's fuel filler cap in this instance - might seem alien to Britons, it's a business that has been going great guns in the US recently.</p><p>Firms including WeFuel, Filld and FuelMe have captured the market in America, with the trend for app-ordered diesel now becoming an option for motorists living in London.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Back in the UK, Zebra Fuel sources diesel from the same suppliers as traditional petrol stations but says it can keep prices down by cutting the cost of 'sky-high rent' retailers have to pay for premises in the capital.</p><p>The on-demand provider also suggested that vehicle owners will cut their fuel bills by not having to drive to petrol station forecourts and queue with the engine running - though many will argue that they only fill their vehicles at retailers on their existing routes and rarely have to wait to access a pump.</p><p>When This is Money checked the cost of fuel on the app - which is available to download in the Apple App Store or Google Play - on Monday, the price per litre of diesel was \u00a31.21.\u00a0</p><p>The provider also adds a delivery fee - similar to Uber Eats and Deliveroo when it brings your food to your front door - that fluctuates depending on the time of the day.</p><p>Off peak charges are \u00a32.99 while deliveries during peak hours include an additional bill of \u00a33.99 - more often than not that will offset the fuel savings you'll make by not driving to the pumps yourself.</p><p>That said, a quick check at PetrolPrices.com showed that the cost of fuel at petrol stations in Central London at the same time was around \u00a31.20 per litre, making the fuel fees relatively competitive.\u00a0</p><p>The company's next product will be ZebraBio - Zebra-exclusive eco-friendly clean diesel, which it says 'will help improve air quality'.</p><p>Bosses also confirmed that it will offer hydrogen when that technology becomes more widespread.</p><p>The latest injection of funds is proposed to cover the cost of increasing the fleet of delivery drivers and vehicles and expand the coverage of the service.</p><p>It also plans to launch in Paris later this year and operate in four major European capitals by 2020.\u00a0</p><p>'Additional products will be offered through the app making Zebra the Amazon for your car,' Mr Bennis added.</p><p>Earlier this month, BP launched a BPme app to allow motorists to pay for the fuel they pump into their cars on their smartphones.</p><p>Similar to the Shell Fill Up &amp; Go app launched with PayPal in 2015, the system notifies forecourt staff when you intend to pay using your phone and takes the payment from the card registered to the account meaning you don't have to enter the premises and pay at the counter.</p><p>                     Is fuel delivery safe?\u00a0                   </p><p>One concern among motorists may focus on the safety of having a vehicle transporting fuel around the city.</p><p>However, Zebra Fuel guarantees that it has taken every step to ensure that it meets industry standards.\u00a0</p><p>'Safety is our top priority and we make sure to communicate that to everyone here at Zebra,' the website states.</p><p>'We have also implemented safety, regulatory and ethical procedures to mitigate possible risks.'</p><p>Customers are only charged with the amount of fuel required to brim the tank of their car the Zebra vehicles are equipped with measured compliant dispensing units that provide proof of how much has been pumped into your motor.</p><p>It adds that current UK regulations limit the delivery of petrol though promised to provide the service to drivers of unleaded vehicles soon.</p><p>Source: Thisismoney.co.uk\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-41073061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKK-5YH1-JCJY-G0H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1170\"/><timeReceived>10:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Microsoft\u2019s entrant to the competition \u2014 the Xbox Series X \u2014 is due out in November. Sony\u2019s release date for the new PlayStation PS5 remains unknown, but the company has confirmed it will be available for holiday 2020.   The latest iteration in the battle for gamer love will look familiar to those who were there for the last round in 2013 (or the round before that in 2006). Tech specs will be held up head to head, game catalogs will be scrutinized and compared and fans of one system or the other will insult each other on social media. The race to actually get one\u2019s hands on a console will be fast-paced and cutthroat, as supply will be limited and demand incredibly high heading toward the holidays.   But it will also be a different console war than what we\u2019ve seen before, partly because of pandemic-related production woes and the much greater than normal difficulty getting the latest and greatest gaming-console technology to the masses.   However, some of those changes will also reflect the fact that gaming has changed tremendously in the mobile era \u2014 grown explosively in the COVID-19 period. Gaming has gone from a massive niche in digital entertainment to becoming one of the global entertainment industry\u2019s main hot spots.   Gaming market researcher Newzoo recently estimated that  2.7 billion people  \u2014 more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2014 will play a video game this year. And gaming\u2019s growth during the pandemic  has generated increased spending on gaming . Gamers worldwide are forecast to spend roughly $160 billion this year alone.   Not surprisingly, such large consumer spend has attracted big interest from the Googles, and Apples and Amazons of the world, looking to grab a slice of the growing revenue pie.   In a gaming space that\u2019s becoming increasingly complex, 2020\u2019s Console Wars won\u2019t only be about which console ends up on top, as had been the issue in previous years. After all, consoles don\u2019t matter nearly so much in a world where video gaming is becoming one and the same as mobile gaming.   A Tale Of Two Strategies    Preseason forecasts estimate that Sony will sell about 5 million PS5 units this holiday season to the Xbox\u2019s 3 million. Barring a major miss on Sony\u2019s part, PlayStation should outperform the Xbox because the Sony console has a better catalog of exclusive games \u2014 which has historically provided the advantage, according to The New York Times . Additionally, Xbox\u2019s signature Halo game series won\u2019t have its latest release available until 2021 due to COVID-related delays.   The two companies are also pursuing different marketing strategies. Sony is relying on its traditional tactics, hyping its newest machine\u2019s improvements (sleeker, faster, better graphics, etc.) in tandem with touting its exclusive content catalog. The company will argue that it\u2019s necessary to own the PS5 to enjoy the latest and greatest that PlayStation has to offer.   On the other hand, Microsoft is going a very different way this year. Matthew Ball, managing partner at venture capital firm Epyllion Industries, told the Times that Microsoft is certainly promoting the Xbox Series X, but is less invested in putting all of its gaming eggs in one basket.   \u201cSony is focused on convincing gamers they need to get a PlayStation 5,\u201d he said. \u201cMicrosoft is telling customers they can get a Series X, or a lower-cost Series S, or keep your old Xbox, or use your PC, mobile phone or tablet \u2014 and we\u2019re still there for you.\u201d   Case in point, Microsoft  announced earlier this week that its game-streaming service XCloud is now available to users of Google's Android service. Billed as the \u201cNetflix of Gaming,\u201d the service allows gamers without consoles to access the Xbox lineup anywhere there\u2019s a fast enough internet connection (10Mbps or better). Access to the streaming system requires Android users to sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which costs $14.99 per month after a $1 trial. It offers more than 150 games.     \"One of the key benefits of cloud gaming is that it gives you more choices in how to play,\"  Kareem Choudhry , Microsoft's vice president for cloud gaming, said in a statement. \"Cloud gaming as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now opens up the world of Xbox to those who may not own a console at all.\"     Choudry went on to note the service is equally relevant for Android users who are already Xbox console owners, as it allows them to move games from consoles in their living rooms to anyplace they happen to be with their phone or tablet.   Unlike Sony, Microsoft isn\u2019t looking to make its content exclusive just to those willing to shell out some $500 for a top-of-the-line console. Instead, it\u2019s willing to open up access even if that runs the risk of diluting console sales and ceding this year's Console War to Sony.   Given the market\u2019s changing shape, Microsoft might not care, as the battle for gaming dominance is increasingly looking disconnected from the battle for console dominance.   New Combatants Are Entering The Fray    Big Tech firms have noticed over the past year that gaming is big business, and they\u2019ve begun moving into the field quickly and aggressively.   For instance, Google last fall launched its  game-streaming service Stadia . Shortly afterward, Apple launched its own game-streaming service called  Arcade .   Apple also sought to expand access to Arcade as part of this week\u2019s rollout of the tech giant\u2019s new Apple One subscription bundles. Those include game streaming at all subscription tiers offered.   Amazon hasn\u2019t yet formally thrown its hat into the ring, but rumors have abounded for several years that it has its own game-streaming service under the code name \u201cProject Tempo.\u201d   Is This The Console Wars\u2019 Final Battle?    High-quality digital gaming wasn\u2019t really possible in the past absent the high-test hardware included in purpose-built video-gaming consoles. But in a world where 5G is emerging with much-higher mobile Web speeds than have ever been available, specialized console hardware might no longer be necessary.   That isn\u2019t to say that consoles are done, or that the Xbox Series X or Sony PS5 won\u2019t sell well this holiday season. They certainly will \u2014 and will probably sell out in short order in a lot of places.   But whether the Console Wars will continue to be the only center of the gaming world seems unlikely given Big Tech\u2019s interest in the sector. In fact, 2020 might be the final battle in the Console Wars as we\u2019ve known them.     \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

Fears about the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">spread of the coronavirus</url> whacked stock futures this morning \u2014 and led to the cancellation of Mobile World Congress. More on that below. (Want this in your inbox each morning?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">Sign up here</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The race to be the next Fed chair is getting interesting</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Judy Shelton, who has been nominated to the central bank\u2019s board of governors, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">scheduled to testify</url> before the Senate today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She is a contentious choice for the job, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT notes:</p><p> Ms. Shelton has questioned whether America needs the Fed at all.</p><p> She favors pegging the value of the dollar to something like gold, an idea the U.S. abandoned decades ago.</p><p> She\u2019s seen as open to bending her ideological positions to please President Trump, eroding the Fed\u2019s political independence.</p><p>But she appears to be moving into a prime position to become the next Fed chair if Mr. Trump wins re-election, Ms. Smialek adds. The president has openly derided the current chairman, Jay Powell, and could well pick someone more in tune with him ideologically when Mr. Powell\u2019s term is up in 2022.</p><p> Washington speculation had focused on a different candidate for Fed chair: Kevin Warsh, who was on the central bank\u2019s board during the financial crisis. Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Warsh before, but some wonder whether a strong performance by Ms. Shelton today would give her the inside track.</p><p>Is \u2018Beyond Petroleum\u2019 for real this time?</p><p>BP announced yesterday that it plans to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">carbon-neutral by 2050</url>, an ambitious target for one of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies. What that actually means, however, is up for interpretation.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">The oil giant\u2019s proposal</url> is its latest climate-minded initiative, with a twist. Not only is the company seeking to reduce its own carbon emissions, it said, but it also wants to offset the emissions from use of the oil and gas that it produces.</p><p>The proposal is more complicated than it looks. It has to do with the \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">scope</url>\u201d of emissions targeted by the plan: The bulk of pollution created by BP\u2019s products are generated when customers burn the fuels, which are called Scope 3 emissions. BP\u2019s net-zero pledge covers only its more direct operations, although the company plans to reduce Scope 3 emissions significantly.</p><p>U.K. regulators investigate Barclays C.E.O.\u2019s ties to Epstein</p><p>Barclays<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">disclosed this morning</url> that British financial regulators have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">opened an investigation</url> into ties between its chief, Jes Staley, and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>The context: The two men had known each other <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">since at least 1999</url>, when Mr. Staley led JPMorgan Chase\u2019s private bank, where Mr. Epstein was a client. The financier had helped funnel dozens of wealthy clients to Mr. Staley, and the two men stayed in touch even after Mr. Epstein was accused of sexually abusing scores of women.</p><p>Mr. Staley has the backing of the Barclays board, for now. The bank said he had been \u201csufficiently transparent\u201d about the nature of his ties to Mr. Epstein, and the C.E.O. said that he hadn\u2019t had any contact with the disgraced financier since taking up his post in December 2015.</p><p> Mobile World Congress was canceled. Does anybody care?</p><p>Mobile World Congress, the annual jamboree for the telecom industry in Barcelona, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">was canceled yesterday</url> over fears about the coronavirus outbreak. It raises an interesting question: Do these kinds of conferences matter?</p><p>Last year, MWC drew around 110,000 attendees (including 7,900 C.E.O.s) from 200 countries. Cancellation of this month\u2019s edition was inevitable, after major exhibitors like Nokia, Ericsson and Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">pulled out</url> over the past week or so.</p><p>This presents a natural experiment in the value of industry events, seen by some as essential for networking and deal making and by others as price-gouging junkets. Thousands of meetings that would\u2019ve taken place at MWC this year now won\u2019t happen, which could have knock-on effects later in the year. (Or not.)</p><p>The view from a veteran: We spoke with Ben Wood, a telecom analyst at CCS Insight in London who would have made his 23rd consecutive appearance at MWC this year.</p><p> For the companies that blow huge portions of their marketing budgets on MWC, \u201cif you find that you can cope without going, and the costs associated with it, you may choose to deploy your resources in different ways,\u201d he told DealBook.</p><p> That\u2019s harder for small companies that rely on \u201cserendipitous moments\u201d with big buyers or potential partners wandering the halls of events like MWC, he added.</p><p>No touching.

The organizers of a big tech event in Amsterdam now underway <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">praised attendees</url> for \u201csafe greeting practices such as fist or elbow bumps.\u201d Generally speaking, it must be said, handshakes are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">incredibly unhygienic</url>.</p><p>Credit Suisse\u2019s chief leaves on a defiant, awkward note</p><p>Tidjane Thiam delivered his final earnings call as the Swiss bank\u2019s chief this morning, after being pressured to resign amid <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">controversy over a spying scandal</url>.</p><p>He presented the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">growth in net income</url> of 69 percent as the result of his changes in the structure and strategy at the company. \u201cWe\u2019ve built something of quality, the numbers are coming through,\u201d he said at a press conference.</p><p>There was a notable moment of reflection on his uneasy tenure at the bank, notes the NYT\u2019s Amie Tsang, who was listening in on the call. \u201cThere are differences within Switzerland in how people feel about me,\u201d Mr. Thiam said. \u201cEvery second I\u2019ve done the best I could. I am who I am, I cannot change who I am.\u201d</p><p>How Marc Benioff sold Trump the trillion-tree idea</p><p>President Trump has openly dismissed climate change activists as \u201cprophets of doom.\u201d But Marc Benioff of Salesforce managed to win him over on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">one particular environmental initiative</url>, Lisa Friedman of the NYT writes.</p><p>Mr. Benioff pitched Jared Kushner, a top White House adviser and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, about the initiative to plant one trillion trees to help offset carbon emissions. The idea eventually \u2014 and unexpectedly \u2014 wound its way into Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.</p><p>\u201cTrees are the ultimate bipartisan issue,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the NYT. \u201cEveryone is pro-tree.\u201d</p><p>There are two lessons to draw from this:</p><p> Successfully lobbying Mr. Trump is an unconventional process that involves back-channeling with trusted advisers.</p><p> The idea of one trillion trees appears to have taken hold with the president because, as Ms. Friedman notes, \u201cit was practically sacrifice-free.\u201d</p><p>Jeff Bezos\u2019 latest takeover: David Geffen\u2019s L.A. mansion</p><p>The Amazon chief has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">continued his real estate splurge</url> with two new acquisitions, according to Katy McLaughlin and Katherine Clarke of the WSJ:</p><p> David Geffen\u2019s palatial Los Angeles home, which Mr. Bezos bought for $165 million \u2014 setting a record for the city in the process.</p><p> A plot of undeveloped land in the L.A. area, purchased from the estate of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.</p><p>They follow Mr. Bezos\u2019 $80 million purchase of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html\">the top four floors</url> of a Manhattan apartment building last year, reportedly with the goal of turning them into a gigantic pied-\u00e0-terre.</p><p>It\u2019s a windfall for Mr. Geffen, who bought the L.A. mansion \u2014 the former estate of the movie mogul Jack Warner \u2014 for $47.5 million in 1990.</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p> The parent company of T-Mobile reportedly wants to renegotiate the price of its takeover of Sprint.

Yet these are just a few of the charges being made against TikTok by everyone from tech titans to senators and think tanks.</p><p>While many Americans are aware of TikTok it has been the most-downloaded social media app in the United States for some time, beating out Instagram and Facebook fewer know about its origins and ownership. The app was launched in 2017 by ByteDance, a Chinese tech firm. While TikTok itself is headquartered in Los Angeles, it ultimately answers to its parent company's office in Beijing. As with all Chinese companies, ByteDance's obligations to the Chinese Communist Party are murky: though ostensibly independent, its full cooperation is expected when needed to \"maintain national security.\" Whether or not China's security concerns will mandate turning over data from Americans, now or in the future, remains to be seen.</p><p>In the meantime, legislators are beginning to pay attention. Congress held a hearing two weeks ago to probe ties between the tech industry and China, though TikTok turned down its invitation to appear. Suspicion of the app has been bipartisan: Sen. Tom Cotton has joined Sen. Marco Rubio and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in voicing concern that TikTok may be censoring mentions of the ongoing Hong Kong protests.</p><p>Yet the loudest criticism of the app has come from its competitors in Silicon Valley, such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has repeatedly attacked his company's fastest-growing competitor. In a fiery speech delivered at Georgetown University last month, the billionaire tech tycoon attempted to cast TikTok as an enemy of free speech and a vessel for the Chinese government to spread its authoritarian norms. By Zuckerberg's estimation, Facebook is the natural great defender of American values, alongside its messaging software WhatsApp. TikTok has fired back, asserting that The more Mark Zuckerberg has come under scrutiny, the more TikTok has shown up in his speeches, interviews and op-eds. You would have to ask him if this is pure coincidence.</p><p>The concern about TikTok from Silicon Valley is certainly cynical. What Zuckerberg failed to mention in his speech is that his company had tried and failed to buy TikTok's predecessor, a fact that threatens to reframe his warnings as nothing more than attempts to use government power to suppress a potent rival. Facebook is also currently enduring its own share of congressional scrutiny over accusations of monopoly and user privacy violations and will do whatever it can to divert the gaze of lawmakers.</p><p>But Congress need not prosecute one case at the expense of the other. This is the view of Sen. Josh Hawley, who has positioned himself as Big Tech's nemesis on Capitol Hill. Hawley chaired the hearing on TikTok not long after he introduced a bill to regulate addictive social media features with Twitter and Facebook in mind. As he put it to reporters, \"Thankfully, they're not the Communist Chinese government, but I don't know that they're exactly good actors, either.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123335451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJX-MW91-JCBF-S053-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Amazon CEO reassured staff that he remains focused on his job and said he still does a \"tap dance into the office\" every morning. Investigators are still working on Bezos' behalf to establish exactly how and why his texts to Lauren Sanchez were leaked to US tabloid The National Enquirer. </p><p>Jeff Bezos may have had a tumultuous start to 2019, but he can still see the funny side. That's according to CNBC[1], which obtained a recording of an all-hands Amazon meeting last week, in which Bezos joked about the saga of his sex texts to TV presenter Lauren Sanchez. During the meeting, Bezos asked how the start of the year had been for employees, before referring to his own circumstances, which has seen his intimate messages beamed across the world after they were obtained by the National Enquirer. \"If you don't mind, just raise your hand, if maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 you've had a better start to your 2019 than I have. Anybody?\" Bezos asked staff, according to CNBC. \"I noticed that a couple hands didn't come up \u2014 I'm sorry for you guys.\" Read more: Michael Sanchez insists he didn't leak Jeff Bezos' racy selfies, but he keeps refusing to answer a key question[2] The founding CEO then sought to calm any nerves about his commitment and focus to Amazon, the world's third most valuable company after Microsoft and Apple. Bezos said that he still goes to work with a spring in his step. \"I am as engaged and focused on Amazon as ever. I still tap dance into the office. I get to work with remarkable people. I get to live and work in the future. And that's where I like to be, so thank you,\" he reportedly said.The Bezos sex text investigation continuesWhile Bezos had a reassuring message for staff, investigators are still working on his behalf to establish exactly how and why his texts to Sanchez were leaked to the Enquirer. The investigation is being led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime ally of Bezos. He has concluded that Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez, leaked the written messages to the Enquirer, while his attentions have turned to Saudi Arabia as to the reason why the publication was so sweet on the story. Vanity Fair reported that de Becker is preparing a 90-page report that is expected to accuse the Enquirer of running the story as a favor to its Saudi investors[3]. Bezos has also hinted at Saudi motives for wanting to smear his reputation, writing in a now-famous Medium blog post that his ownership of The Washington Post is a \"complexifier.\" \"The Post's essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles,\" Bezos said. Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement in the story[4]. \"I've been watching it on television and reading about it in the paper. This is something between the two parties. We have nothing to do with it,\" said minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, last month.NOW WATCH: We tried Louis Vuitton's wireless earbuds to find out if they're worth the $995[5]See

So have debates over what responsibilities big, well-funded tech firms have to service minority or low-income communities. </p><p>Meanwhile, as the $18 billion dollar technology/transportation company <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>continues to see massive growth, it's\u00a0become a surrogate in arguments over\u00a0highly\u00a0disruptive startups\u00a0facing\u00a0regulatory\u00a0struggles\u00a0a[2]nd\u00a0criticisms over safety[3]\u00a0and\u00a0cutthroat competitive tactics[4]. So when I heard that Zuhairah Scott Washington, general manager of <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>DC, would be interviewed by\u00a0Kathryn Finney, the founder of digitalundivided[5]\u00a0which promotes the participation of urban communities in tech, I knew I didn't want to miss it. The first of digitalundivided's 'Innovation Thursdays' did not disappoint, making for a fascinating discussion that shone\u00a0a light on how the fastest growing technology companies interact with urban communities, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. Washington, unsurprisingly, heralded the many benefits a service like <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>offers\u00a0drivers,\u00a0riders, and businesses in urban areas. 'There are only a handful of opportunities where you can, without extensive training, make over $20 an hour on your own time using, with no real startup costs, someone else's technology,' she said. Washington also argues that because <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>drivers do not accept cash, the risk to drivers is much lower (more on that later). As for riders, Washington recalls a time in her younger days when cabs refused to\u00a0take passengers above 96th street in Manhattan. With <person><nameText>Uber, </nameText></person>she says,\u00a0'There is no discrimination regarding where you're going to go.' Nor, Finney argues, is there as much discrimination of riders compared to\u00a0traditional cabs, citing instances\u00a0when she and her husband struggled to convince taxi drivers to pick them up. Washington claims that the lack of discrimination over rider and location creates ripple effects for businesses off the beaten path that a city's residents may not otherwise visit. But the narrative of\u00a0Uber as\u00a0savior and defender of urban\u00a0communities\u00a0isn't quite so airtight. While <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>undoubtedly provides opportunities for\u00a0workers regardless of their skill level or education, the company has continued to cut fares[6],\u00a0which may make customers happy, but hurts\u00a0drivers. (<person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>argues[7] that the reduced fares result in more rides per hour, which makes up for the losses to\u00a0driver\u00a0income). Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped drivers in Southern California from aligning with the powerful labor union, the Teamsters,[8] in search of better worker representation. As for Washington's claims that it's safer to drive an <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>car than a cab, it's worth noting that while <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>drivers\u00a0don't carry cash, they are guaranteed to have a smartphone. She also mentioned a new partnership with Belkin to provide\u00a0cars with $200 worth of phone charging equipment\u00a0which, while good for riders,\u00a0sweetens the deal for thieves even more. Indeed,\u00a0Uber drivers in LA have\u00a0reported a recent spate of robberies at gunpoint[9]. It's unclear whether the criminals are using the app to locate the drivers first, but it's hardly\u00a0an outlandish conclusion to make. I\u00a0mentioned these counterpoints to Washington and asked how <person><nameText>Uber, </nameText></person>as it continues its massive growth, can prevent itself from becoming as dangerous and exploitative to drivers and passengers as the taxi industry. While she didn't\u00a0deny that\u00a0these issues exist, Washington\u00a0claimed Uber\u00a0will deal with these hurdles\u00a0in a far more innovative and driver/rider-friendly way than the taxi industry historically has. 'We have the, dare I say, burden of being an innovator,' Washington says. 'You've disrupted the space, and now people expect so much more.' For example, in DC, background checks for cab and livery drivers go back three years, Washington says, while <person><nameText>Uber's </nameText></person>go back seven. That's an improvement, but now people are demanding lifelong background checks. It's not an easy request to grant, both from a business perspective and in the context of last night's event and the impact <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>has on urban workers. Regarding lifelong background checks, Finney says, 'For many African Americans, that can be a challenge.' Washington responded by saying, 'There's a balance. That seven-year threshold is based on federal guidelines around Fair Credit Reporting.' In any case, Washington says the key to <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>maintaining service and safety standards, as well as fair wages for drivers, lies in the fact that it operates like a tech company, not a transportation company. 'As a general manager, it's my job to look at our Net Promoter Score across all metrics, the rider side and the driver side,'\u00a0Washington says. 'That's not how most businesses were previously run.' One of the most important\u00a0things to keep in mind when considering <person><nameText>Uber's </nameText></person>impact on communities is that whatever positive contributions the company makes will be done first and foremost to benefit <person><nameText>Uber's </nameText></person>business. Hell, if there's anyone strongly opposed\u00a0to running an altruistic operation, it's the Rand-crazed Travis Kalanick[10]. Finney says that's something community-minded\u00a0entrepreneurs should keep in mind when convincing big tech firms to get involved. 'Come\u00a0at it from a business perspective, and not 'what are you guys going to do for me,'' Finney says. For example, the argument she made to convince <person><nameText>Uber </nameText></person>to participate in digitalundivided events was,\u00a0'We know we have a lot of black folks, Harlemites, using your app. And by having a presence here you'll reach them.' It's advice that makes sense when dealing with outspoken libertarians like Kalanick, but also with other companies that\u00a0are equally profit-obsessed, just less brazenly outspoken about it. 'Making the 'feel good' argument doesn't always work,' Finney says. 'Particularly in the tech world, it rarely works.'

According to social contract theory, citizens decide to enter into a governed society as long as the government can protect us. If large companies like Facebook can have access to our entire lives through their platform, isn't it logical for the government to protect us from these companies using their power to corrupt their users?\u00a0</p><p>Amazon and Google are also large tech monopolies, but operate slightly differently. These platforms use their power to, for lack of a better word, kill their potential competition. They are able to purchase smaller companies and force them to sell at discounted rates, which often causes them to become bankrupt. Further, these massive companies are able to promote their own products. AmazonBasic items are cheaper and there is such a great quantity of them throughout the site, that they are often more appealing to consumers. Google is able to put its reviews above Yelp when you search for a restaurant, getting them more hits than the competing site. Having this power gives big tech companies the ability to control what consumers see, and it is fair to be concerned by that fact.</p><p>Some scholars, like Robert Reich, have begun to consider this time period, full of large tech companies, as a second Gilded Age. For context, the Gilded Age was a time where robber barons created big companies like Standard Oil. These companies monopolized the market, defeating and absorbing any possible competitors. Thus, President Roosevelt formed the Sherman Act, one of the three main antitrust laws in our country. These acts are put in place to prevent monopolization or unfair methods of competition. These acts were found to be violated in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp. Due to the precedent set by this case, it is within the government's jurisdiction to sue companies that have become monopolies, even though CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg oppose all regulation.\u00a0</p><p>Because Facebook is the most accessible monopoly to most of us millennials and gen z-ers, let's return to it for a moment. We have seen Instagram - one of Facebook's branches - continually develop and unusually become more and more like Snapchat, another popular social media platform. Instagram has introduced stories, and recently a new app called Threads, that is advertised as a \"camera-first messaging app that helps you stay connected to your close friends,\" which sounds a lot like how someone could describe Snapchat. Further, there has definitely been a shift from teens talking about how their streaks might die, as if it's the end of the world, to teens using Instagram stories more often, and jumping more quickly on the trends they see through that site. There are clear indications that the Facebook empire may soon enough be the only social media empire, but with its background in user exploitation, Russian collusion, and overall user unease, maybe Warren's plan is just what citizens need to regain their security online.\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4286492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8H-4JN1-JBSN-32FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Scarlet: Clark University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
