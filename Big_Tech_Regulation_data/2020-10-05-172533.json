Both Facebook and Twitter are in bare  market territory while Alphabet, Netflix, and Amazon are in correction  territory those are trading higher this morning.  In Europe this morning,  stocks are higher.  Take a look, Ft-100, CAC quarante, DAX Index all up  with the German Index, the DAX up almost one percent.  In Asia overnight,  green across the board.  It was fractional moves for the most part but  Shanghai Composite in China was up better than one percent.  Rebuilding  America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan today in Ohio in an effort to fulfill yet another  campaign promise.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're trying to build roads  and bridges and fix bridges that are falling down.  And we have a hard time  getting the money, it's crazy, Washington will no longer be a roadblock to  progress.  Washington will now be your partner.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  And  then protecting our borders as President Trump unveils new pictures of  construction of the wall, hundreds of law enforcement officials are  throwing their support behind that billed out.  Then hacks planes  ransomware reportedly strikes Boeing.  What you need to know as the company  becomes the latest to be hit by the WannaCry virus.  </p><p>Then this.  From self-driving SUV to a million-dollar car, we've got all  the highlights from the New York auto show.  Wait until you see some of the  hot wheels there this week.  And then to infinity and beyond.  We're taking  you to outer space where astronauts are preparing for a spacewalk just  moments from now.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Forbes Media chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate, Steve  Forbes.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, there is.</p><p>BELL:  A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge.  We're going  to talk about that, I know.  It will be interesting to see what the next  step has to say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then of course, the final day of the -- of the  quarter.  We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the  first quarter, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook,  let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm  going to teaser up.  Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal  has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as  care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to  borrow.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get  things back to reality.  Markets been worried about what might happen.   Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  We're going to get back to what's  happening in terms of the fundamentals.  We have this breaking news, the  President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning.  I have stated  my concerns with Amazon long before the election.  Unlike others they pay  little or no taxes to state and local governments.  Use our postal system  as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United  States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business.  The  President just tweeted that about Amazon.  Now, the President is taking his  pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as  a proposal stalls out in Congress.  Adam Shapiro covering the story from  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  And a good morning to you, Maria.  The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p>And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p>Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p>FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p>FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p>FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p>FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p>FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p>Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.  But yes,  this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of  user data, interacting abuser.  So we'll let you decide on this one.   Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year. </p><p>OK.  Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving  at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start  a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours.  They're going to install  new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for  you, Maria.  We're going to keep watching.  And then finally there is this.   Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC  in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR:  And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great  again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back  episodes.  That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of  the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us.  And also  President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on  the show's early success.  Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p>BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p>FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for  years.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.  </p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.  He'll  weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well.   President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more.  Stay with us for  that.  Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show.  We're  taking you there.  Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official  opening tomorrow.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula,  North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have  decided to meet on April 27th.  This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p>If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p>NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p>Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p>NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p>Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p>We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p>RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p>RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p>RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p>RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p>RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p>RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p>RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p>RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p>RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p>RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p>Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p>And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p>You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p>GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p>FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Thursday, March 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m.  on the East  Coast.  Bulls fight back this morning, futures are pointed to gains at the  start of trading, on this the final trading day for both the month and the  quarter.  Dow Industrials expected to be up of 80 points right out of the  gate today.  NASDAQ expected to be up 50.  Follows yet another day in the  red for the major indices yesterday even though it was just fractional  moves.  The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March  -- month of March in nearly 20 years.  </p><p> The big concern technology, shares of several big names under pressure of  its fears of a regulatory crackdown.  Both Facebook and Twitter are in bare  market territory while Alphabet, Netflix, and Amazon are in correction  territory those are trading higher this morning.  In Europe this morning,  stocks are higher.  Take a look, Ft-100, CAC quarante, DAX Index all up  with the German Index, the DAX up almost one percent.  In Asia overnight,  green across the board.  It was fractional moves for the most part but  Shanghai Composite in China was up better than one percent.  Rebuilding  America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated  infrastructure plan today in Ohio in an effort to fulfill yet another  campaign promise.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're trying to build roads  and bridges and fix bridges that are falling down.  And we have a hard time  getting the money, it's crazy, Washington will no longer be a roadblock to  progress.  Washington will now be your partner.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What to expect from the big push coming up this morning.  And  then protecting our borders as President Trump unveils new pictures of  construction of the wall, hundreds of law enforcement officials are  throwing their support behind that billed out.  Then hacks planes  ransomware reportedly strikes Boeing.  What you need to know as the company  becomes the latest to be hit by the WannaCry virus.  </p><p> Then this.  From self-driving SUV to a million-dollar car, we've got all  the highlights from the New York auto show.  Wait until you see some of the  hot wheels there this week.  And then to infinity and beyond.  We're taking  you to outer space where astronauts are preparing for a spacewalk just  moments from now.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Forbes Media chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate, Steve  Forbes.  And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Great to be here.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES:  Good to be here this morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, there is.</p><p> BELL:  A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge.  We're going  to talk about that, I know.  It will be interesting to see what the next  step has to say.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then of course, the final day of the -- of the  quarter.  We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the  first quarter, Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook,  let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm  going to teaser up.  Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal  has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as  care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to  borrow.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FORBES:  The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get  things back to reality.  Markets been worried about what might happen.   Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  We're going to get back to what's  happening in terms of the fundamentals.  We have this breaking news, the  President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning.  I have stated  my concerns with Amazon long before the election.  Unlike others they pay  little or no taxes to state and local governments.  Use our postal system  as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United  States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business.  The  President just tweeted that about Amazon.  Now, the President is taking his  pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as  a proposal stalls out in Congress.  Adam Shapiro covering the story from  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  And a good morning to you, Maria.  The issue  will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland  just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield  Coliseum.  He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because  the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill.   There is no one comprehensive bill.  What the President wants is $200  billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public  partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next  10 years.  </p><p> And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of  creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually.   It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people  over the next 10 years.  And it would also help improve access to education  and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the  infrastructure projects.  Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said,  well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure,  there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding  proposals in separate legislation.  But here's what Sarah Sanders said  yesterday about all of this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Following on success  of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's  successful economic agenda.  These workers represent the hardworking  Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our  nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will  definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SHAPIRO:  So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from  Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines.  The other headline this  morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans  Affairs David Shulkin.  Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York  Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country.   He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the  environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need and deserve.  Maria, back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks so much.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that.  Former Reagan  budget director, David Stockman.  David, good to see you.  </p><p> DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  Good  morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now  the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest  private money.  Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I think he should forget it.  We don't have $200 billion to  spend.  We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone  through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never  seen before.  We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and  we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300  billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200  billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in  the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal  situation under control.  </p><p> Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is  state and local.  90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user  fees.  We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is  bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing  money and actually going to be selling bonds.  This is the worst time for  him to be thinking about this.  Now he is sleepwalking.  He needs to wake  up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you say, Steve?  </p><p> FORBES:  Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to  be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these  things get off the table.  But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use  for the state and local level, are they up to it?  Are they willing to put  fees in?  And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an  infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved.  FedEx, UPS, no  shortage of delivery trucks.  Railroads, best in the world after  deregulation in 1980.  So the government is involved, they always have a  maintenance problem.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  That's why they should forget this.  Let the  private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is  local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local.  If the  local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves,  that's their choice, let them live with the consequences.  When we take it  to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel.  We're already spending  more on highways than ever before.  We have 45 billion gas tax, less than  20 billion that goes to the interstate.  The rest of it is --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FORBES:  When did that start because when the trust fund was originally  created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system,  period.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Steve -- </p><p> FORBES:  Where did it all go?  You were there for a while.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it goes for things like bypass, right?  It goes -- this  money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because  in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more  than 20 years.  The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you  have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding  the repair of roads.  That's unfair.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree with that one hundred percent.  And that's the problem  with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress.  It's a logrolling situation.   So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money,  the mass transit people get money.  It goes everywhere.  Even to local  roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left  over.  So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure.  If you  hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's  really a boondoggle.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional  infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right?  Omnibus spending  bill.  So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for  infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending  bill.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Let me give one example of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part  of the money that they're going to use.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Of course.  Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger.  It  was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local  governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth.  The  Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually  Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have.  If you look at this  bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life.  Obama -- I mean Trump  tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites  and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63  billion.  In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100  billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it  so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the -- what about the border wall?  I mean, that's  another priority of the President.  And the President tweeted out, photos  of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.  380 sheriffs,  meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall.   It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the  Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill  signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending.   But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the  wall not install a new one. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in  my entire career when I started in 1970.  People come across the border for  two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by  cancelling the war on drugs.  They come here to work, you solve that by  giving them work permits.  If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we  wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing  they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply  drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the  problem. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you do then? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  You repeal the war on drugs. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge  of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything  else is distributed.  Making drugs illegal is what has created this  problem. </p><p> FORBES:  That's another subject for another time.  (INAUDIBLE) extra  billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not necessary. </p><p> FORBES:  Or defense spending? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely not.  We have -- we have a 600 billion defense  budget, now it's 700 billion.  The problem is not too little money, it's  too many missions. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the  sequestration. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  They have --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even  fly.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, but --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you.  If they  didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new  stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland  and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out  of 600 billion. </p><p> FORBES:  So we shouldn't have troops in Korea? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Absolutely, no.  If Europe can't take care of itself by now with  17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years?  Japan  can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs  to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't  have the troops?  You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't  happen by an accident.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke  in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have  one.  They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FORBES:  The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the  tubes.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got to jump.  David, great insights.  Thank you.   David Stockman there.  Coming up.  Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry  computer virus.  How the company is responding this morning amid alarming  concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment.  That's  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry  ransomware attack.  Cheryl Casone on headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  The company says the  virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in  Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was  spreading.  Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions.  And they  recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer  systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  Taking a  look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one  percent. </p><p> Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across  devices.  Yes.  The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work  laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities .  About 60  companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the  initiative.  Adobe says the service can help companies offer more  personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying.  But yes,  this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of  user data, interacting abuser.  So we'll let you decide on this one.   Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year. </p><p> OK.  Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving  at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start  a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours.  They're going to install  new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for  you, Maria.  We're going to keep watching.  And then finally there is this.   Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC  in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROSEANNE BARR:  And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great  again.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back  episodes.  That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of  the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us.  And also  President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on  the show's early success.  Here is what she said about that call on Good  Morning America.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARR:  It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us.   It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television  and ratings. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He does focus a lot on ratings.  </p><p> BARR:  Oh, yes.  He really understands the ratings and how they measure  things.  And that kind of an interest of mine too.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking  about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out  there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  18 million, that was incredible audience.  And earlier we  said -- </p><p> FORBES:  Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for  years.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.  </p><p> FORBES:  Yes.  And she shows there's a constituency out there, the  Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a -- that's a good point, Steve.  I agree.  All  right.  Coming up.  I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  We're going to get in to the trade issues.  He'll  weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well.   President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more.  Stay with us for  that.  Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show.  We're  taking you there.  Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official  opening tomorrow.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula,  North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have  decided to meet on April 27th.  This led mark meeting will emphasize  improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula.  Setting  the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between  President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDERS:  We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a  global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we  can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working  towards that goal.  As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that  offer and we've accepted.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea  trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon  in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car  manufacturers.  Joining us right now is the White House National Trade  Counsel Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  </p><p> PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL:  Yes.  Good  morning.  A lot of excitement around here today.  The Easter Egg hunt this  weekend.  So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That sounds great.  So, Peter, what do you think the  significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea  and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly.  I can tell  you two things.  One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as  the head of the negotiations that will take place.  My role here has been  simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic  deal with South Korea will do two things.  One, it will eliminate the  economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade  deficit.  And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view  that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many  decades now.  I think what I find most interesting on the home front about  this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.  </p><p> If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this  thing about light trucks.  We were able to extend the ability to levy a  tariff on light truck through 2041.  And that means, real jobs and you got  the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the  Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint,  Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan.  And who says tariff don't  work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon  Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the  vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but  for defense industrial base.  So President Trump visionary saw a problem  coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these  trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> NAVARRO:  And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things  in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to  keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not  necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so  managing an existing relationship.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Yes.  I've heard that.  Two things there.  One is that countries  around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to  build up their own manufacturing base.  And in the case of light trucks,  it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good.  In January we put tariffs  on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do  we get?  We got to flood new investment.  But we're also really strongly  committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade.  And the biggest  problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts.   It's 80 percent of the deficit.  And so what we've done there is a  combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we  that can send to them.  At the same time they're going to lower these  nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> NAVARRO:  They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental  standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own  safety standards which are probably higher than theirs.  So it's a great  thing.  And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the  side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on  steel.  So, it's all good.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because  China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to  start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we  know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we  might see.  What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs  as it relates to China?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the  purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what  we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China  2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in  government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world.  We're  taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch  of industrial policies that violate free market principles.  And what we're  doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump  and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that.  So that's  the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the  Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a  long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual  properties.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask --</p><p> NAVARRO:  Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  I know that technology transfer, we've  talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that  China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us  frankly for all of these industries.  But when you're looking at the  investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being  written right now in terms of China investing in United States.  I mean,  China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners.  Are we going to  have something similar like that?  Are we going to have restrictions in  terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much  China can acquire?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China  is so different from everybody else.  Every other country that goes in and  invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and  a fair rate of return for their shareholders.  What China does is it uses  its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in  Europe, and other countries.  They don't care about earning a return, they  just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through  acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.  </p><p> Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really  key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense.   And so, we need to be very careful about that.  And the Chinese,  unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006.  They've told us  what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it.  A  lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the  trading environment.  And President Trump, unlike every other president  before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not  just for the American people but for American business in our defense.  So,  this is important.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like we will see restrictions.  It sounds like we  will see restrictions on investments in those industries.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own.   What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the  problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and  national security.  And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want  Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial  intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use  them? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I was asking specifically about financial services and  semiconductors, Peter.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Sorry, I didn't hear that.  Those are those are all sectors that  are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer  and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their  lane.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the  NAFTA deal.  But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a  couple weeks.  The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA  negotiations.  It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year.  You  got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in  the U.S.  Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?  </p><p> NAVARRO:  Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three  principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators.  And I agree with  your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to  Mexican elections.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> NAVARRO:  But there's optimism.  And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert  Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal.  They're the two  people that'll get it for us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much. </p><p> NAVARRO:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th.   Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to rebound  this morning.  Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70  points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a  percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as  well.  </p><p> Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both  rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and  two-tenths of a percent respectively.  Initial jobless claims were down in  the latest week to 215,000.  And today marks the final trading day of the  month and the quarter.  The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first  quarterly decline in more than two years.  Stocks closing today; yesterday  lower, fractionally so.  The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly  one percent.  </p><p> We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data.  As you  just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal  spending up two-tenths of a percent.  And the core PCE rate, which the  Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the  expectations.  Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global  Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under  management.  Great to see you, Rick.  </p><p> RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK:  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, we just had some  economic data.  Do you one of PCE?  I mean, how focused are you on that in  terms of what it tells us about inflation?  </p><p> RIEDER:  Very, very importantly.  In fact, as you described on air, the Fed  is -- that's the Fed's number one metric.  And one of the things that I  think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind  curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two.  So, the Feds said, no  raise -- core CPI is about 1.8.  So, we watched Core P.C. very, very  closely.  If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll  accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a  historic context, that's scary a number.  So, the Feds are going to keep  moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised  to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this  year, is that what you think?  </p><p> RIEDER:  No, no.  I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep  going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around  there; they go three times, four times.  You know, I think one of the  things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's  where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are  they going to be.  And one of the things that markets got nervous about is  they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace.  They don't need  to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace.   But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the  markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about  higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all  overdone?  You like equities here, don't you?  </p><p> RIEDER:  I do.  I think they will ultimately go higher.  There's something  -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p> RIEDER:  There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I  don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in  this environment where we've been at zero interest rates.  The funds rate  is set at zero.  The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has  been at zero.  So, where do you go to get your yield?  You've had to go --  I mean, this chart extraordinary.  By the way, if you look at this chart  versus history and go back to '06, '07.  (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's  happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than  dividend and the dividend payout.  You look at -- I mean, it's pretty  ominous when you at 06, 07.  By the way, I don't think when an ominous  period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the  alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera.  All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of  the yield curve.  And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster,  it's incredibly a trap today.  When people -- when we finished the year, I  don't think rates are moving that much higher.  But I do think you can move  up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2.  With that front end to the yield  curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I  carry really well.  If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year  treasuries.  And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the  rate of inflation, which is terrific.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high  rates.  You're still -- low rates?  </p><p> RIEDER:  Totally.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> RIEDER:  Totally.  And the point being, people focus on the 10-year  treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over.   The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to  three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the  year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high  rates.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any  time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.  </p><p> RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand.  It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't  get three.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> RIEDER:  Yes, I don't really understand that.  I mean, there is a  difference.  By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference  because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk.  That is a big deal.  But listen, if rates move up  gradually, then markets will be fine.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you think there are values in equities right now? </p><p> RIEDER:  I do, I do.  I think.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us about that.</p><p> RIEDER:  So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether  it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks  people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in  January; people were building a lot of risk.  Evaluations in the equity  market today are not that bad.  I mean, there are places, I would argue,  you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income.  But when you think about,  you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples,  and some of these.  They're actually pretty attractive today.  You know, so  some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and  then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build  a balanced portfolio.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about  to enter.  The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate  earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p> RIEDER:  Not only earnings.  I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to  get a sense for what is the forward growth.  The revenues are going to be  pretty substantial.  Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be  durable earnings.  And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people  talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing.  And I  could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will  continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good.  And by the way, 21  percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for  a while.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent --  close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal.  And you think this is  going to have legs?  It's not just going to be an overnight success, but  we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.  </p><p> RIEDER:  I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies,  particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera.   The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off  (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending.  Now, that being said,  there's one that I think is a concern.  The amount of debt we're putting in  the system is a lot. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars  this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue.  How does  that impact the bond market?  </p><p> RIEDER:  It's a big deal.  By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the  equity market.  You know, listen, there is some part which have driven  short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills.  We're going to  do bills.  We get two years, three years, five years.  It's a lot of debt.   For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that  has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot.  It's what will push -- you  know, inflation is not scary.  It's what is going to push rates moderately  higher.  You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various  ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how  much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to  come out of the market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?  </p><p> RIEDER:  So, first of all.  I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so  then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away.  Why  would all this volatility?  Emerging markets aren't moving around that  much.  It's because they don't have leverage to use at.  And they're giving  you substantial yield.  So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of  secured assets.  So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well,  don't take a log of yield curve for us.  You can make in fixed income. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me get your take on the Libor.  The journal is reporting  that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that.  What do you think  are the implications of that?  </p><p> RIEDER:  It's huge.  I mean it today, it is the financing of the market  poise.  Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in  Fox.  I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set  anything done.  And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign  banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that.  It's incredibly  important because it's the gearing of how financial system works.  It  doesn't get focus on enough.  Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here.   We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize.  And a lot of  the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the  repatriation.  We'll shut to stabilize.  But people underestimate how big a  deal.  There's so much important (INAUDIBLE)  in the financial system.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Rick, thanks so much for your insight.  </p><p> RIEDER:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend.  Rick Rieder of  Blackrock.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Technologies got a bid this morning.  Tech  stocks are higher after the sell-off recently.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be  boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  I know, Maria, well, this is the last  trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great,  there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have  to do that in all those prior -quarters.  I got a note from over at  Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to  the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday.  But they  expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia,  Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days  sooner than later.  Quick look at some of the details here.  So, Facebook  in the premarket is up one percent.  </p><p> Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with  some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your  information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes.  Before  the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100  employees.  They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing.  Snap  over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.  </p><p> And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president,  President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's  been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they  use the postal system as their delivery boy.  Amazon a bit to the down side  this morning.  Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we  feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that  we've been seeing for Amazon.  But big picture, tech have been the story of  this month.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  Amazon not catching a bid,  stock is down as you just told us, Nic.  Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney.  Stu, good to see you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  You, too, maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out  of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on  retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p> VARNEY:  I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the  President.  I'm not surprised by it.  After all, The Washington Post which  is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs  Amazon.  So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so  I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking  of our antitrust laws.  I think that the big tech companies have created  quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of  industries.  And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with  some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them.  What form it  takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to  take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or  early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming.  And I think that's  what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of  antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more  influential than they've ever been.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, absolutely so, yes.  I mean, look how much of the stock market  rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks.  It's 40 percent, something  like that.  Extraordinary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's 27.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  27 percent.  Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  excitement revs up for the New York auto show.  We've got a sneak peek at  the coolest wheels hitting the road.  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  NissanRenault looking to make their marriage  official.  The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports  say now they may officially merge.  This comes, as car companies show off  their new models at this year's New York auto show.  That's where we find  foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu.  Gary, good morning to you.</p><p> GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR:  How you doing, Maria?  You  know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be  surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are  SUVs.  There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup.  And the  showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas  Tanoak concept.  And this is one that they're going to be thinking about  making in Tennessee if enough people like it.  More car-like than a pickup  truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people  raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because  there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.  And based on the  attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.  </p><p> You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days,  and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now.  It's the Rimac  Concept Two.  This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of  all places.  It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times  more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258  miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale.   And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can.  We'll see about  that.  It is the Concept Two.  They've made the Concept One which they have  already sold.  So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for  about a million dollars a pop.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would  say that.  It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot  wheels there.  But the trend has once again been big.</p><p> GASTELU:  Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln  Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles  coming up soon.  You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better,  people are moving up into the bigger vehicles.  And there's no stopping  that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Gary, thanks so much.  Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto  show.  We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from our all-star panel right  now.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p> BELL:  That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about.   We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax  reform in those numbers.  We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers  enough or not?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously.  We're  expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018.  Steve Forbes?</p><p> FORBES:  We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war.  That South  Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up.  Big thing, next  thing we look at is NAFTA.  We get the same kind of agreement there.  Wipe  your brow.  Please stake a big one.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p> FORBES:  That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico?  We  could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, the lefty guy.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton  meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love  her.  I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships  that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, a good point.  Great panel, everybody.  Thanks for being  here.  Wishing everybody at their happy Easter.  Dagen's got you covered  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stu, take it away.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

But President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that an emergency order would be issued banning flights by not only the MAX 8, involved in the two recent crashes, but also the slightly larger 737 MAX 9. Flights currently in the air were to be ordered to land as soon as possible.</p><p> \"Certainly there is near-term damage to both Boeing's reputation and it's business,'' says Jim Corridore, director of industrials equity research at CFRA Research. \"But how long lasting and how deep this impact is depends on the outcome of the investigation and how Boeing reacts.''</p><p> It's the second crash of a 737 MAX 8 in less than five months. A Lion Air flight went down in Indonesia in October killing 189 people.</p><p> On Wednesday, travel search site Kayak announced that in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia, it will enable fliers to filter out aircraft they do not want to fly starting this week.</p><p> \"We've recently received feedback to make Kayak's filters more granular in order to exclude particular aircraft models from search queries,'' Kayak's chief technology officer Giorgos Zacharia said in an emailed statement. \"We are releasing that enhancement globally later this week and are committed to providing our customers with all the information they need to travel with confidence.''</p><p>Boeing has been working on the automated anti-stall system that is believed to have caused the Indonesian accident, but the inquiry into what led a second MAX 8 to nosedive on Sunday in Ethiopia is just beginning.</p><p> \"I believe that whatever the problems are will be temporary in nature provided Boeing acts quickly and decisively once the problems are known,'' says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.</p><p> But Boeing still has to work with investigators to come up with the definitive causes of both accidents, Harteveldt says, how they differ or mirror each other \"and then determine what can they do ... Is it an engineering problem? Is it a software problem? Is it a training problem?''</p><p> Shortly before the U.S. made it's move, Canada grounded the 737 MAX, banning the aircraft from flying through its airspace on Wednesday. It joined countries and regions around the world, including the European Union, United Kingdom, Indonesia and China, that had already taken similar actions.</p><p> Until Wednesday afternoon, two U.S. carriers, American and Southwest, were the only airlines in the world continuing to fly the MAX 8, while United flies the MAX 9.</p><p> Southwest operates 34 MAX 8 jets in its fleet of over 750 Boeing 737s.</p><p> American flies 24 MAX 8 jets, and said Tuesday that it was waiting on the delivery of 16 more this year. Another 20 should be delivered in 2020 and 2021, and 40 are slated to join its fleet in 2024 \"and beyond.''</p><p> United has 14 737 MAX 9 jets.</p><p> The 737 Max came on the scene in 2015, and though only 350 of the planes in its different variations are in service right now, more than 4,660 are in the pipeline as it has become Boeing's most coveted jet.</p><p> Black techies head south: Goodbye, Silicon Valley, hello, Atlanta: Black entrepreneurs part of new migration to South</p><p> Deals could bring on March Madness: March freebies: Your monthly guide to food specials, meal deals and more</p><p>Facebook strikes back: Facebook temporarily removes Elizabeth Warren ads about breaking up big tech</p><p> \"I would say it's the single most important product that Boeing has right now.''

It's long-awaited Dreamliner, the first commercial jet to be primarily made of lightweight carbon composites instead of aluminum and steel, was grounded in January 2013 after a battery caught fire on one jet, and a smoldering battery forced an emergency landing of another.</p><p> But Boeing \"found a way to fix the problem and the 787 Dreamliner has continued to fly without incident,'' Harteveldt says</p><p> Still, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D- Mass.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) had remained concerned about the 737 MAX 8 and had called on U.S. regulators to halt its flights like other nations around the world.</p><p> Records show that federal aviation authorities got at least 11 reports regarding apparent safety problems with the MAX 8 that were logged between April 2018 and December 2018.</p><p> Two pilots reported their planes unexpectedly pitched nose down after engaging autopilot following the jets taking off. Another pilot said the plane's automation triggered a \"temporary level off.\"</p><p> Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, Gus Garcia-Roberts, Steve Reilly, Alison Young</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Boeing's shares falls as U.S. grounds 737 MAX 8 and 9 after latest plane crash</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-a813fd93e2a1b7504a9d737c9af2958393f758c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN2-P5T1-DXVP-V0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A Lion Air flight went down in Indonesia in October killing 189 people.</p><p> On Wednesday, travel search site Kayak announced that in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia, it will enable fliers to filter out aircraft they do not want to fly starting this week.</p><p> \"We've recently received feedback to make Kayak's filters more granular in order to exclude particular aircraft models from search queries,'' Kayak's chief technology officer Giorgos Zacharia said in an emailed statement. \"We are releasing that enhancement globally later this week and are committed to providing our customers with all the information they need to travel with confidence.''</p><p><person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>has been working on the automated anti-stall system that is believed to have caused the Indonesian accident, but the inquiry into what led a second MAX 8 to nosedive on Sunday in Ethiopia is just beginning.</p><p> \"I believe that whatever the problems are will be temporary in nature provided <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>acts quickly and decisively once the problems are known,'' says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.</p><p> But <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>still has to work with investigators to come up with the definitive causes of both accidents, Harteveldt says, how they differ or mirror each other \"and then determine what can they do ... Is it an engineering problem? Is it a software problem? Is it a training problem?''</p><p> Shortly before the U.S. made it's move, Canada grounded the 737 MAX, banning the aircraft from flying through its airspace on Wednesday. It joined countries and regions around the world, including the European Union, United Kingdom, Indonesia and China, that had already taken similar actions.</p><p> Until Wednesday afternoon, two U.S. carriers, American and Southwest, were the only airlines in the world continuing to fly the MAX 8, while United flies the MAX 9.</p><p> Southwest operates 34 MAX 8 jets in its fleet of over 750 <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>737s.</p><p> American flies 24 MAX 8 jets, and said Tuesday that it was waiting on the delivery of 16 more this year. Another 20 should be delivered in 2020 and 2021, and 40 are slated to join its fleet in 2024 \"and beyond.''</p><p> United has 14 737 MAX 9 jets.</p><p> The 737 Max came on the scene in 2015, and though only 350 of the planes in its different variations are in service right now, more than 4,660 are in the pipeline as it has become <person><nameText>Boeing's </nameText></person>most coveted jet.</p><p> Black techies head south: Goodbye, Silicon Valley, hello, Atlanta: Black entrepreneurs part of new migration to South</p><p> Deals could bring on March Madness: March freebies: Your monthly guide to food specials, meal deals and more</p><p>Facebook strikes back: Facebook temporarily removes Elizabeth Warren ads about breaking up big tech</p><p> \"I would say it's the single most important product that <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>has right now.'' Corridore says. \"It's the largest portion of what's in <person><nameText>Boeing's </nameText></person>backlog and on its production schedule . . . Nobody's ordering 737s any more. It's all 737 Max 7, 8 or 9.''</p><p><person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>has rebounded from a crisis before. It's long-awaited Dreamliner, the first commercial jet to be primarily made of lightweight carbon composites instead of aluminum and steel, was grounded in January 2013 after a battery caught fire on one jet, and a smoldering battery forced an emergency landing of another.</p><p> But <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>\"found a way to fix the problem and the 787 Dreamliner has continued to fly without incident,'' Harteveldt says</p><p> Still, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D- Mass.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) had remained concerned about the 737 MAX 8 and had called on U.S. regulators to halt its flights like other nations around the world.</p><p> Records show that federal aviation authorities got at least 11 reports regarding apparent safety problems with the MAX 8 that were logged between April 2018 and December 2018.</p><p> Two pilots reported their planes unexpectedly pitched nose down after engaging autopilot following the jets taking off. Another pilot said the plane's automation triggered a \"temporary level off.\"</p><p> Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, Gus Garcia-Roberts, Steve Reilly, Alison Young</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <person><nameText>Boeing's </nameText></person>shares falls as U.S. grounds 737 MAX 8 and 9 after latest plane crash</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-1b5f72daff6e61a4a5b0811fd1356bcce257588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5F6E919BEC NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN2-WF21-DXVP-V01Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily American<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The beginning of a shortened trading week. Dow Industrials at the high of the morning with a gain of 103 points, the S&amp;P is up seven, the Nasdaq, however, is lower by 15 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after Friday's big selloff, wiping out Nasdaq gains for the week. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 also down for the week, down about 3 percent on average for the major averages last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FaceBook ad boycotts. The list of major companies pulling advertising dollars from FaceBook is growing, costing the company billions. The stock is under pressure in the premarket this morning. As you can see, it is down better than $6 a share right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boeing, meanwhile, takes flight. Tests of the 737 Max begin this week. The stock is up on the news by about 3.5 percent.</p><p>And the Federal Reserve shopping list is out. The central bank releasing names of companies that it is purchasing corporate bonds from. They include automakers, telecommunications companies, even beverage giant Coca-Cola. A lot of people following what the Fed is doing. We'll watch those companies.</p><p>Meanwhile, China takes major steps to clamp down on Hong Kong's freedoms just ahead of Wednesday's anniversary of the handover. Beijing says it will also impose visa restrictions on Americans with what they call egregious conduct on Hong Kong related issues.</p><p>Plus, gun store robberies are surging. Later this hour, an ATF official who says it's the biggest spike he's ever seen. Find out what's driving the alarming trend and what is being done about it.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher. European indices searching for direction but to the positive side. FT 100 is up 29 points, CAC quarante is up 10 points, and the DAX index is higher by 50 points in Germany. That's almost half of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was red across the board, actually, as the number of coronavirus cases surpass 10 million across the world. The worst performer was Japan. The Nikkei average down two and a third percent.</p><p>This morning, joining the conversation, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle and Philip Wigmann.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>And today we kick off a new segment called the \"Word on Wall Street,\" where I will get insight from top money managers on the most significant stock stories of the morning. Let's get started.</p><p>Today's \"Word on Wall Street,\" a pivotal week for Boeing. The embattled aircraft maker receiving Federal Aviation Administration approval to begin test flights of the new 737 Max jet. Tests could take flight as early as today. And the stock is rising ahead of all of that. The best-selling aircraft was grounded last year after two deadly crashes.</p><p>Joining me right now is Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist David Nelson, Washington Crossing Adviser, Senior Portfolio Manager, Kevin Caron, and Cornerstone Macro's Co-Founder and Chief Economist Nancy Lazar.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>And, David, I want to kick it off with you.</p><p>You are a commercial pilot. Give us your take on Boeing's return to flight.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE ASSET MANAGEMENT: Look, they're conducting a series of flight tests, just like you said. And I guess that Boeing, right now, is pretty confident that, one, the flight tests will pass and, number two, that the agency is ready to sign off on this. I don't think they'd be even having the test at this point.</p><p>But it begs the question, Maria, I think at this point we can look backwards and say to ourselves, this is likely an aircraft that should never have been built. The flight envelope was pushed too far. And probably the biggest failure here was the fact that additional training was not mandated for pilots because not just here in the United States but outside the United States the -- the regulatory standards and, in fact, the training isn't even as good as here in the United States. Pilots, it's not uncommon for a co-pilot in an overseas airline to have significantly less than a co-pilot here in the United States.</p><p>So a big challenge for Boeing, branding -- rebranding this aircraft and making the American public feel that it's safe again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The stock is up 4 percent right now, David. Would you buy into this situation today?</p><p>NELSON: I think a lot of that's actually already in the stock at this point. It's 28 times next year's earnings, but a 590 number out there, even if I give it $6, it's still pretty expensive. And given in a Covid world, is the demand really there? Leasers right now have -- leasing companies have 45 percent of the commercial fleet. Do they have the appetite, do they have the capital to buy more?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, well, now, let me turn to the pressure on America's oil patch. The \"Word on Wall Street\" this morning, Chesapeake Energy filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The energy giant says it will use the bankruptcy proceedings to cut around 7 billion in debt.</p><p>Kevin, it's been a tough year for energy companies, of course, with the price of oil where it's been, leaving investors struggling to find a solution. But Chesapeake is one of those companies that has -- really was on a growth story for many years but the debt is not going to be easy to get around with the price of oil where it is today.</p><p>What's your take on this story?</p><p>KEVIN CARON, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS: Yes, it's a familiar story across the energy sector, actually, if you look more broadly. You've got a sector that has increased the amount of debt on their capital structure and relative to the overall value of all of their businesses significantly. In fact, coming into the coronavirus, that number, debt relative to the whole value of the industry, was at a record high. So when you have those -- that kind of balance sheet and market concerned about the price of oil relative to very significantly slowing economy, the combination of those -- those levered balance sheets with a lot of pressure on the top line, that causes all kinds of problems and we're going to -- and we're going to see it -- we're going to see it in many areas over the next few months.</p><p>Moody's is talking about anywhere between a 6 percent and 20 percent default probability depending upon how bad this virus gets across the whole speculative grade spectrum. So expect more to come, but high debt and very --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Kevin, do you -- do you -- that's what I was going to say --</p><p>CARON: Very few -- big hits of revenue are a problem. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that we're going to see more bankruptcies in the drilling segment?</p><p>CARON: I think you're going to -- I think you're going to see it -- I think you're going to see it broadly speaking. I don't know about bankruptcies per se in that -- in that -- in natural gas, but, broadly speaking, you're going to see -- you're going to see more stress because you've got a lot of debt that has increased in the corporate sector, so this would be just another example. And I suspect there's going to be more to come, which is why it's really important to focus on quality in the portfolio, keeping debt down, looking for consistent cash flow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, let's broaden out and look at reviving the U.S. economy. The first half of the year was obviously tumultuous. Investors navigating a global pandemic, historic unemployment, nationwide protests, a volatile stock market.</p><p>Nancy Lazar with the word on the street right now in the recovery in the second half of the year.</p><p>Nancy, I know you are still believing that this v rebound is still intact. What are your expectations for the second half of the year, Nancy?</p><p>NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO: So after a 25 percent drop in the second quarter, I think by the third quarter you are already seeing signs that growth is rebounding sharply. We're using plus 20 percent for the third quarter.</p><p>Now, I do think it's going to be a wavy recovery. What's happening with the Covid -- with the resurgence in Covid in certain states is a reminder that this will be potentially a volatile recovery. So by the fourth quarter, things slow back down, something closer to 5 percent, but that's still a pretty decent pace.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nancy, you've talked a lot about capital expenditures. Tell me why that's important and what you're expecting from cap ex because this is an area where once you start seeing companies start spending more on capital expenditures, that is a real economic indicator, isn't it?</p><p>LAZAR: It is. We saw that last week with the durable goods orders report. You've seen it in the manufacturing indices we've seen from individual regions. You are already getting a pick-up in capital spending in the United States. It's not the kind that we had in the last expansion or last prior expansions where it was global and you were seeing capital spending surge in China. It's now coming back home. Obviously, we're very passionate about this on-shoring theme or the U.S. manufacturing renaissance theme, which actually started in about mid-2012, '13, '14.</p><p>Now, as we go into the back half of this year, again, I would argue the capital spending uptick is already unfolding. And the reason that's so important is because when you get investment domestically, you actually create jobs, not just within those individual industries, but there's a positive multiplier. Really I would call it an investment-led cycle from housing, which classically is -- is -- is -- also has a positive multiplier for jobs and also so does capital spending. And capital spending is actually a very, very broad term. It's not just building factories. It's financing industry, reinvesting in their business. It's the -- it's the -- it's the retail industry rejiggering their business for this new -- new economy, restaurant industry. So capital spending is very, very broad.</p><p>Twenty percent of cap ex dollars do come from manufacturing, but you do have two-thirds of all the capital spending dollars actually come from the service sector and you're already starting to see, again, companies having to reinvest in their business given this new backdrop of social distancing. So technology is an important driver of it, but also classically (ph) old economy cap ex is going to be a beneficiary also of this increase.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's funny, sometimes people look at capital expenditures and they don't include technology spend in there, and that's probably one of the most important spends on software for -- for big companies, and that -- and that spending hasn't slowed down.</p><p>Nancy, we saw some good numbers on retail recently. We saw good numbers on jobs. We have the jobs report coming up this week. Are you expecting another increase in jobs and I guess I want to ask you a question about policy. I know that it's sort of baked in the cake at this point in terms of the Trump administration policies, but do you think your outlook on the economy would change if you saw Joe Biden getting more -- gaining more ground and perhaps the idea that he may make Elizabeth Warren, his Treasury secretary, she's obviously going to change tax rates, she's going to change the deregulation story as well, which President Trump put in place.</p><p>LAZAR: So, first, on the job front, you are clearly seeing hiring come back. Again, we saw that in the May report. We're going to see it in the June report. Three million probably for June and July. You are getting a v rebound in jobs, no question. There are still way too many people unemployed and you continue to need support for them.</p><p>I'll go back to capital spending. This is going to be a different job market. You are gouging out the leisure industry, but you are getting new jobs in manufacturing, construction, technology. Those are huge supports for the job cycle. As one of your prior segments highlighted, there will be new jobs for some of these people who no longer will be able to work in the leisure industry.</p><p>So, every recovery you always see a sector of the economy not come back. Housing was the last cycle, 2002, 2007, it was manufacturing. So it's not unusual in a recovery to see a mixed shift in the job market.</p><p>As far as looking forward from a political perspective, I try to stay focused on -- on the economy. I would hope either administration would realize businesses create jobs. China knows that. That's why they joined WTO in 2001. France knows that. And that -- you have a French government do structural reform. Japan did that in 2012 with Abe. We've seen jobs come back to the United States from the on-shoring that's already happened. We need to encourage it.</p><p>Investment is truly the backbone of the economy. The consumer is obviously a bigger share of GDP, but companies create jobs and we can't disincentivize them to reinvest in the country and to create a new job path for many people who will have a tough time coming out of this -- out of this crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, great conversation.</p><p>David Nelson, Kevin Caron, Nancy Lazar, we so appreciate your time this morning. Thank you so much for the \"Word on Wall Street.\"</p><p>Much more ahead this morning. We've got a big interview coming up. Up next, my interview with the Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken on the pandemic's impact on the future of healthcare and the future of our economy. Wait until you see the structural changes that he's talking about in this economy coming up.</p><p>And then, next hour, Wyoming senator, and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Barrasso is here, talking about his infrastructure plan.</p><p>And the Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Pillsbury talking about the latest on China and China imposing new visa restrictions on Americans.</p><p>Plus, this, looking sharp online. The company looks to tailor your suits using artificial intelligence. We're going to check it out. Don't miss it. We'll be right back. Coming up with that.</p><p>Plus, the great flag debate. Mississippi looking to change its state flag. We are taking a look.</p><p>And then a big win for Kim Kardashian West. The new stake in her beauty line.</p><p>All that, right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Coronavirus treatment and vaccine. The Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken likening the search for both to the Manhattan Project. I sat down with Milken and asked him about that and his thoughts on the economic recovery as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Mike, you and other scientists, you are looking at this as if it's a Manhattan Project for Covid-19, aren't you?</p><p>MICHAEL MILKEN, CHAIRMAN, MILKEN INSTITUTE: It's a Manhattan Project, but it's a Manhattan Project, Maria, with technology, with computers that are millions of times faster than they were than when that Manhattan Project went into effect.</p><p>And so if a person wants to be optimistic, that is what America is about and our entire system of medical research has been transferred.</p><p>There is a downside. And there is collateral damage. And those are the issues of people that have had heart attacks and didn't go into the hospital, or strokes, or people that have not taken their cancer treatments. So there's collateral damage. And maybe as we come out of this, one of the greatest challenges we have is to mental health that we're very focused on.</p><p>But the medical community has done its part. The government, particularly in financial support, has done its part. The financial markets have done their part and provided more capital and more issuance in any month in history to allow companies to bridge.</p><p>The next step is, we need to get capital into these communities of color. We discussed for years food deserts where people didn't have access to quality, healthy food. We have financial deserts. Out of 5,000 approximate banks, only 21 are headed by people that are African-Americans. We need to get capital into these communities so they can get into these small businesses.</p><p>Out of 15 million small businesses that the government has been monitoring, 3 million -- 3 million of those have been shut down in the last three to four months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILKEN: And, unfortunately, those led by African-Americans, 41 percent of those small businesses have been shut down. And almost 22 percent for the whole country. So we need to get capital out to these minority banks to help support their communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.</p><p>Broadly speaking, in terms of this economy coming back, will we get back to normal? I mean, obviously, the innovation happening in healthcare is incredibly important and that's going to lead growth and lead us to open up this economy again. But how worried are you about the long-lasting impact of this several month shutdown and the recession that we're currently in, Mike?</p><p>MILKEN: Well, there's two issues there, Maria. And the most important is what about the citizens of our country and the citizens of the world? What about their health? What about their financial safety? What about how they feel about themselves? What about the future? That is the challenge we need to focus on and particularly focusing on internships, mentoring and jobs.</p><p>The second part of the economy, it will open, but we've accelerated the movement to technology. Telemedicine, 100 times as many visits this year in a day as last year. That will not return. Many people will use telemedicine in the future. So what the economy is, how it's structured is changing.</p><p>Delivery. Whether you are target or Kroger or Walmart, not just Amazon, you've moved significantly to the delivery of goods and the American public will get used to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILKEN: Education. Media. Entertainment. Sports. All the ways that these will be delivered in the future. So the economy will be different. It will be robust. But it will be much different than it was before this process began.</p><p>There is a serious issue in mental health. Eighty percent of all mental health visits were canceled during this period of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MILKEN: When you say, when will the economy be open? The people fear what is going to happen to their jobs. Are they going to change? Will they have the skills for the jobs? So that's -- this is definitely something that's going on. And I think one of the areas that you might pursue with others is the fact that, you know, 4 million or so high school students didn't have a graduation.</p><p>And maybe their internships or summer jobs don't exist and maybe they delayed the start of their other jobs. So this uncertainty is a question.</p><p>Getting through this thing mentally is one issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILKEN: How do we get people to get through uncertainty? That is, I think, something very important. And that will be a most important part of the election. How do people feel about the future? Do they have a future? I think that's a very important.</p><p>The other thing you might -- that you brought up that we didn't pursue is both the Democrats and the Republicans will be pushing on China over the next few months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MILKEN: And how will that play out.</p><p>Best of health to you. Good to see you. Wonderful always to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mike, thank you. You too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Holding big technology accountable. The Justice Department is moving forward to completing an anti-trust investigation into Google, which is expected to end with a lawsuit this summer.</p><p>Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee undergoing its own investigation into Google, Apple, Amazon and FaceBook.</p><p>On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" I spoke with California Congressman Devin Nunes about this and his lawsuit against Twitter and how big tech is working to control information.</p><p>Tell us why you believe that tech tyranny is one of the most important issues going into the November election.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Google, FaceBook and Twitter, OK, they're the tech oligarchs, they're tech tyrants. They're taking all of this content that, you know, 90 percent of the news media is not only left wing but it's owned now by billionaire left wingers. When you plug that content into those three giant tech companies, it's really starting to have an influence and an effect on -- on the politics of -- in this country.</p><p>Republicans and conservatives are being driven out and off of that Internet super highway.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The conflicts are only getting bigger in terms of government versus big tech here. How do you see it?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I don't see this as an anti-trust violation. And the -- and the news reports over the weekend that the attorney general, Bill Barr, has directed the anti-trust division to draft some sort of an anti-trust complaint against big tech and argue that their exclusion of conservative, libertarian, socially conservative voices from their platforms somehow violates anti-trust laws. Now, anti-trust laws are -- are violations of economic principles. Any contract or combination, meaning they'd have to do this in concert with each other, in restraint of interstate trade that affects prices would be an anti-trust violation.</p><p>What they're going to run into, that is the -- the DOJ, if they do this, they're going to run into a brick wall called the First Amendment because this is all about speech. We may not like the judgment calls that Mark Zuckerberg will make or that Twitter makes, but they have the freedom to do so and the government cannot interfere with that freedom.</p><p>The best thing that -- and I share a lot of Congressman Nunes' complaints. I myself, as far as I know, have not been taken off, but I have friends who have. The remedy under anti-trust laws is more competition. The not -- the remedy is not government regulation of speech. That's what I think the courts will do with any effort by the DOJ to get -- get involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, at this -- but at this point, Judge, they -- they call themselves platforms and they have not been acting like platforms. It's not a platform that you've got all this different speech on that platform, right, because they are deciding not to put conservative speech there. So if you're not a platform, then you would -- you would expect that they would lose that protection that they can't get sued.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the protection that they have is -- is from a statute and, quite frankly, there's -- there's angst on both sides of the political aisle over whether that statute should exist. The statute basically says, as you -- as you've just indicated, they're a platform, they're a bulletin board. So you can sue the person who posts the message, but you can't sue the entity that hosts the message.</p><p>If they continue to -- to crush one side of this argument, they may lose that protection. But that would require not judicial intervention but a vote of the Congress. And it may very well happen.</p><p>But right now, all the equities are on their side because this is all about speech and politics and the government has no role interfering in private speech, particularly political speech.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Judge, that's why Devin Nunes is pushing parlor.com as an alternative to Twitter.</p><p>Judge, thank you. We will see you soon.</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us there.</p><p>A quick break, and when we come back, taking a bite out of Shaquille O'Neal. How he's making Papa John's largest pizza ever.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, June 29th.</p><p>Markets this morning look like this at 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at a mostly higher opening for the major averages on Wall Street. The Dow futures are up 146 points, the S&amp;P futures up 9.25, but the Nasdaq is lower by 17 despite the surge in coronavirus cases we've been telling you about.</p><p>This on top of Friday's selloff. That wiped out Nasdaq gains for the week. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 also lower on the week by about 3 percent on average. The Nasdaq down almost 2 percent on average for the week.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are slightly higher. Take a look. FT 100's up 42, that's three quarters of one percent. The CAC quarante in Paris is up 21. That's a half a percent. And the DAX index in Germany higher by 77 points, two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was red across the board as the number of coronavirus cases now surpasses 10 million across the world. The worst performers, Japan and Korea, down two and a third percent on the Nikki average and almost 2 percent on the Kospi average this morning.</p><p>Mississippi state flag will soon be history.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>State lawmakers passed a bill yesterday to remove the confederate emblem from the flag. The bill is now heading to Governor Tate Reeves who says he will sign it. The current flag has flown since 1894. A commission will design a new flag without the emblem, but featuring the phrase, excuse me, in God we trust. Residents will vote on the new design this November.</p><p>Well, Chase Bank got an earful from some customers over the weekend after they spotted incorrect balances in their checking accounts. One person tweeted early yesterday, really, Chase, nobody manning the phones or digital support until tomorrow morning? I, like thousands of others, have a mortgage payment due this week that just disappeared from my account overnight.</p><p>Well, Chase blames a technical issue that delayed updates on its app and online and they say the problem was resolved at 9:00 in the morning yesterday.

It's a 16-inch extra-large pizza that's topped with extra cheese and 66 pepperoni and it features the pizza chain's largest slices ever cut.</p><p>And those are your headlines, Maria. Back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we are looking at investigating the deaths of American soldiers this morning. President Trump pushing back on a \"New York Times\" report that Russian intelligence paid Taliban linked militias in Afghanistan to kill American and British soldiers. The Trump administration was briefed in late March but has yet to authorize a response.</p><p>President Trump tweeting this yesterday, nobody briefed or told me, Vice President Pence or Chief of Staff Mark Meadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russian as reported through an anonymous source by the fake news \"New York Times.\" Everybody is denying it and there have not been many attacks on us. Nobody's been tougher on Russia than the Trump administration, writes the president. With corrupt Joe Biden and Obama, Russia had a field day, taking over important parts of Ukraine. Where's Hunter? Probably just another phony times hit job, just like their failed Russia hoax. Who is their source, writes the president.</p><p>Well, there are calls for congressional oversight from both sides of the aisle now.</p><p>Joining me right now is Pennsylvania Congressman and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Judiciary Committee, Guy Reschenthaler.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>GUY RESCHENTHALER (R-PA): Good morning. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are your committees doing about this?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, let me just say that, if this is true, we need to get to the bottom of it and hold Russia accountable.</p><p>But, Maria, anybody that knows anything about geo politics in the region knows this is probably not accurate. The Russians are not friends of the Taliban. They fought for years in Afghanistan. Also, Russia is not exactly flush with cash right now since petroleum has hit really low numbers. So I find it very suspect.</p><p>It's also incredibly politically convenient. And, Maria, I've read this book before. I think I know how it ends. It's some low level, unelected bureaucrat that is not -- that thinks he or she is onto something. The information is not credible. Instead of working through the chain of command, that low level bureaucrat then runs to \"The New York Times\" or \"The Washington Post\" and the mainstream media, the liberal media, takes it up to damage the administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: So I -- I'd be willing to bet that that scenario is much more likely than the scenario that the main stream media is running with, which, again, is just to damage the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. You know, this is really getting old, Congressman. I mean this president's entire term has been dominated by investigations. So much so that many of you and your colleagues -- and I'm not blaming you specifically, but the Congress has ignored so many important things, like China eating our lunch, and the national security issues. I mean there are show hearings basically in some of these committees.</p><p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler reportedly planning to subpoena Attorney General William Barr Thursday following the ouster of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. I spoke with committee member, your colleague, Doug Collins on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES and Collins took Democrats to task for these kinds of hearings over the past several years.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've had no hearings on national security and China, and China has been eating our lunch, stealing intellectual property regularly for decades and it has only picked up speed in the last two years. What have you been focusing your time on, Congressman? How many hearings have you had on investigating Trump?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Oh, more than I can count. I mean the thing about it is, is Chairman Nadler seemed obsessed from day from with just simply going after his old counter mate, Donald Trump, who, at the time, when he knew him in New York, and now as president, it was like all I want to do is get at President Trump. We've done nothing but have hearings.</p><p>Remember, Maria, let's go back -- take each other back in time. We started off with the acting attorney general, Whitaker. He thought that was one of the most important hearings we could have had to start last year. And then it rolled into the Mueller report, it rolled into Barr being asked to come in and then he blew up that and then, you know, Steve Cowen and others, you know, making fun, bringing fried chicken to hearings. This is what we've been doing in the Judiciary Committee, we've been having show hearing after show hearing after show hearing. And, really, for the most part, not concentrating on anything that actually could help the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Congressman, what about that? If the attorney general, William Barr, is subpoenaed, is this going to be another show? Is this going to be another waste of our time? And I ask you the same question that I asked your colleague Doug Collins, how many hearings have you had on national security and on China versus the number of hearings you've had on investigating Donald Trump? The American people deserve to know what you and your colleagues are spending your time doing.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Maria, you're incredibly accurate. You know, this is going to be another show trial. And let's just look at it. AG Barr had every right, and so did the president, to fire that U.S. attorney because every U.S. attorney serves at the pleasure of the president, and by extension the AG. So there's no there there.</p><p>The Democrats are simply trying to discredit Attorney General Barr before the Durham report is released. And -- and I think that's going to be very telling on what the Obama administration was doing, spying on the Trump campaign team.</p><p>But you brought up an excellent point about China. We've been asleep for way too long. And China has exploited the situation. They're stealing our intellectual property. They're engaged in corporate espionage. Everything from military, to pharmaceuticals, to quantum mechanics, you name it. These forced IP transfers back to mainland China and they're -- they're also engaging in dumping of natural resources, and even steel, aluminum, you name it, into U.S. markets to take our market share. No one has held China accountable. Democrats are not taking them seriously. At least House republicans have the China task force, which is taking a look at this. But the Democrats are wasting their time with show -- with show hearings instead of actually helping the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is outrageous in my view, OK?</p><p>Philip Wigmann, this is the future of our children and our grandchildren and China and the Communist Party is trying to steal it. And nobody in Congress is focused on this because every other day we're hearing more investigations into Donald Trump. First it was the Russia nonsense, that he was colluding. That was a three year circus. Then it was the Ukraine telephone call and an impeachment trial. When are they going to get to work and do what is important for the American people and stop the theft of intellectual property and our grandkids and kids' future?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, Maria, it's not everyone in Congress.</p><p>PHILIP WIGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, \"REAL CLEAR POLITICS\": Well, the representatives --</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Fifteen House Republicans on the China task force --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Are looking on how to combat it. It's unfortunate that the Democrats, one, have not joined into that task force even though Leader McCarthy invited them numerous times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: And, two, they're wasting all this time appeasing a far left radical base.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Philip Wigmann, final word here.</p><p>WIGMANN: Representative, you hinted about this a second ago. I think it's interesting that House Democrats are reversing where they were a second ago. Now they want to hear from the attorney general ahead of this report coming from Durham. It will be very interesting. And it seems like just one more issue that is taking precedence over a much more important things like China (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Philip, you're exactly correct. And they are trying to get out ahead of the Durham report because I believe that Durham investigation is going to show that the Obama administration and then Vice President Biden knew what was going on and you had James Comey and what I call his merry band of never-Trumpers ignoring all the procedure and precedent and actively spying on a presidential campaign. And if they can do that to President Trump, they can do it to anybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: But they're trying to discredit Barr. And, again, they're not doing anything to actually advance this country. They're not holding China accountable. They're not coming up with actual legislative solutions to problems that we face today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Again, they're continuing to appease that far left radical base.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>And just to be clear, not one Democrat has actually said it's wrong to have unlawful wiretaps on an American citizen, it's wrong to change a document and doctor up actual evidence which is what the FBI did and it's wrong to have informants running into people and entrap them. All of this stuff we know was unlawful already, not a word from your colleagues on the left.</p><p>Congressman, thank you. We'll keep watching, obviously.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Guy Reschenthaler.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Sounding the alarm. Law enforcement on alert as gun robberies surge across the country. More than 1,000 guns have been stolen since late May amid national unrest and protests. Things are getting worse out there, Philip Wigmann. We've got crime numbers rising across our cities right now.</p><p>WIGMANN: Yes, I think what's so interesting is that President Trump ran on law and order in 2016 and now, with the executive order on some of the violence and the tearing down on statues, he's leaning back into that forum. Clearly, the White House see this as an opportunity to paint a contrast between themselves and Democrats who they argue are letting the ball drop on this issue. There is nothing more fundamental to kitchen table issues as safety of neighborhoods and communities and I think that if the left does not moderate a bit on this issue, that could be an opportunity for him going into November.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mitch Roschelle, it's amazing to me that we could not get any changes for police reform. You've got both sides fighting so that I's an issue come the election and they get nothing done.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Yes, it is, in fact, amazing and it was such a lead story on every news outlet of what was going on in the streets across this country.</p><p>Clearly there's a need to do something in the police reform action. You would think this would be bipartisan. But, unfortunately, it's been politicized with both sides sort of digging in and it -- the -- who loses? The American people and the voters. And the question is, how are they going to react in November to all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. So joining us right now is the assistant director of field operations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Thomas Chittum.</p><p>And, Thomas, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>We're talking about these -- these shocking numbers in terms of gun robberies and crime rising across our country. Give us the state of affairs today.</p><p>THOMAS CHITTUM, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ON FIELD OPERATIONS, ATF: Well, at the start of the unrest we believe, as Ben Franklin does, that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So we took action, made contact with firearms retailers in areas that may be affected by unrest, encouraged them to secure their inventories and the records. But as the unrest turned to riots and looting, we saw a tremendous spike in gun store burglaries. In 2019 on average ATF saw a little less than one FFL, or gun store burglary, a day. The numbers spiked up. We saw 90 over the course of just a couple of days. The good thing is, more than a third of those were unsuccessful attempts and we think that that's in part due to our outreach to the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Thomas, how likely is it that the stolen guns will be resold? Where do those guns end up after they're stolen?</p><p>CHITTUM: Those guns end up on the black market and in the hands of criminals. It's not firearms enthusiasts or law abiding citizens that throw bricks through gun store windows and steel firearms. Those guns end up in the hands of criminals that use them to commit crimes, often in the communities where they're stolen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you trying to recover those guns at ATF right now? I mean do you think that the amount of crime has spiked more than you expected in the last year?</p><p>CHITTUM: Well, it's definitely a high priority for ATF. In 2017, we saw a spike in gun store burglaries, almost 600 that year. We responded aggressively through investigations and also industry outreach. We brought those numbers down 20 percent in 2018 and 20 percent again in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Wow. All right.</p><p>CHITTUM: But in 2020, the numbers are considerably higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thomas, good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>Thomas Chittum.</p><p>You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Time for the \"Morning Buzz.\"</p><p>First up, the Covid-19 pandemic did not stop the BET awards. Hosted by Amanda Seales,, the virtual show paid tribute to the best in black entertainment, honoring the Black Lives Matter movement as well. John Legend, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson, channeling iconic singer Aretha Franklin also performing. Former First Lady Michelle Obama was there introducing Beyonce, the recipient of the 2020 Humanitarian Award.</p><p>Lee, did you catch it?</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: A little bit of it. I saw some of the -- some of the highlights. And I think overwhelmingly there was a somber mood, right, with the -- with all of the talk about Black Lives Matter and some of those really, really moving performances honoring Kobe Bryant. But one other thing I really love is strong women lifting up other strong women. And so the moment when Michelle Obama honored Beyonce, called her the queen, I thought was awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I loved that too. You're right.</p><p>All right, next up, summer rental season soaring in Malibu, apparently. Real estate agents are seeing people looking for a change of scenery after months of shelter at home orders. Some homeowners are offering houses for rent at tens of thousands of dollars above normal summer rates as demand surges.</p><p>Mitch, how about that, Malibu was named LA's priciest area in 2019. Is this surge surprising to you?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Not at all. We all have cabin fever, Maria. And you know what happens when you have cabin fever? You dream of a bigger or a new cabin, and that's what people are doing. They're, you know, going from one place to another.</p><p>You're also seeing RV sales up, boat sales up. People just want to get out. They can't travel. It's a $600 million -- billion industry, excuse me, domestic tourism. So you're going to see a lot more staycations throughout the summer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point. Good analysis there.</p><p>Finally, what a waste. A new poll finds millennials throw away 633 meals a year because they don't know how to reheat leftovers. Those polls confess that they often prefer to bin (ph) food instead of reheating it.</p><p>Philip, what do you think?</p><p>WIGMANN: I think my generation -- I think millennials do know how to use microwaves. Tupperware is not that complicated either. I think what's really going on here is that my generation has an aversion to planning. We'd much rather have that instant gratification of Uber Eats and go on our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I understand. Yes, I do.</p><p>Still ahead, looking sharp online. One company is looking to tailor your suits using artificial intelligence. It's as easy as that. It's all here, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, June 29th.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020062902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607X-2T41-JB20-G0X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

To be expected before the Fed makes its decision midweek.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As you can see here, the Dow better, up about 40 percent. The S&amp;P around the same level. Few more gains to be had in the tech sector. Those are the markets. And these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boeing tries to win back trust and win back orders at this year's Paris Air Show. Top U.S. companies bring their arguments on tariffs straight to Washington. And what does the billionaire art collector do once he is tired of paintings? He buys the auction house, of course, Sotheby's has been sold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from the world's financial capital, New York City. It's Monday, June the 17th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest. And this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, Boeing faces a defining moment at one of the world's largest aviation shows. After a turbulent few months, the plane maker seems to be winning back support from some top CEOs and executives. But airlines are not yet putting money crucially where their mouths are. Boeing hasn't announced a new order in two months.</p><p>Meantime, European rival, Airbus just secured 100 new orders and unveiled a new jet. Now Boeing investors, though still seem optimistic. Take a look at this. The stock is leading the Dow thanks to some words of praise from airline CEOs. Among them, the Chief Executive of Qatar Airways, he told us that despite two fatal crashes, it is still flying a 737 MAX.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AKBAR AL BAKER, CEO, QATAR AIRWAYS: If I am given the choice today, to get into a MAX and take a flight, I will do it because I have confidence in the regulators, and I have confidence in Boeing that once they have got to the bottom of what happened to the two very sad incidents, my thoughts are always with their families, thatthings will get back to normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: And the key is they haven't really gotten to the bottom of those yet. Boeing is still at it. Meantime, the annual Paris Airshow is usually what we've come to know is a fierce neck and neck competition between Boeing and Airbus to secure the most orders.</p><p>But as our Melissa Bell reports this year, the plane makers seem to be traveling in some very different directions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: The Paris Air Show kicked off today at Le Bourget just outside of Paris with the usual collection of Airbuses and Boeing's lined up here on the tarmac.</p><p>Normally, this event is all about which of those two aviation giants will get the most orders in this show. How many firm orders will they get and how will that compared to the competition.</p><p>This year, of course, things are very different for Boeing given the crashes involving the 737 MAX both in March and Ethiopia and in Indonesia last October. The loss of the lives of more than 300 people was of course, what Boeing chose to address when its leaders spoke at a press conference this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN MCALLISTER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, BOEING: Bottom line, we will employ every resource across Boeing in a comprehensive effort to make sure we get this airplane safely return to service and when it does, the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Boeing there trying to inspire confidence once again in the future and its commitment to safety. Of course, in the meantime, the figures are not so good for Boeing. They announced on Tuesday that in May, the numbers of deliveries of Boeing were down 50 percent on the same month last year.</p><p>Still though they retain the confidence of a number of the key players that they're hoping to sell their planes to. We spoke today to the CEO of Qatar Airways.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL BAKER: We have full confidence in Boeing. We have full confidence in the machines that we have bought from them which we fly, and our passengers love their airplanes. And they love this airplane, too.</p><p>So we will continue to do business with both of them. We will not sacrifice one for the sake of the other.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: Some hope there for Boeing, but the more profound problem is the longer term. Airbus really exploiting its competitions, moment of weakness by announcing here today, this new A321XLR, so a new version of its older plane that can go further from say the middle of the United States to Europe, really capturing that part of the middle market that Boeing had been hoping to take with a new airplane that it was going to spend $15 billion developing and hoped to deliver by 2025.</p><p>[15:05:05] BELL: Airbus announced today it has sold a hundred planes including 27 of those newA321 really using this moment of weakness in Boeing to try and get ahead in what is an incredibly competitive market.</p><p>The trouble for Boeing is going to be catching up that time that's been lost. Melissa Bell, CNN, Le Bourget.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: You know, and as we were just hearing as if Boeing's troubles weren't enough, one of the world's largest airlines is sending chills through Europe's aviation sector.</p><p>Lufthansa just issued a shock profit warning to investors, blaming that fierce competition from low cost rivals. Now, as you can see here, the airline's stock plunged to more than 11 percent.</p><p>Shares in many of its European rivals also suffered. Now, speaking to Richard at AITA Conference in Seoul earlier this month, Lufthansa's CEO offered some clues about the struggles, the very serious struggles the airline is facing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: The competitive environment in Europe is brutal. And you're competing against airlines that are prepared to sell tickets at a loss. Is that fair?</p><p>CARSTEN SPOHR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LUFTHANSA: Well, as long as the environment is a level playing field, it's a fair competition.</p><p>QUEST: So you all lose money on those tickets --</p><p>SPOHR: We all lose money, and the healthy ones will survive, the unhealthy ones will not. It's another question if it is responsible to do this from an economic point of view, from an environmental point of view, even from a political point of view.</p><p>There I have big doubts, I think is hurting our industry.</p><p>QUEST: Right, answer that question. You've been tactful in saying big doubts, you're saying it's irresponsible.</p><p>SPOHR: I think it is, and it hurts the industry, it hurts politician's perspective of our industry, it hurts our image in public. So I think this is something which in the end, the industry is taking some harm from.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Brian Sumersis a senior aviation business editor at Skift. He joins me now from Los Angeles. You know, Brian, you've been writing for several months about the impact of Boeing, not from a manufacturing point of view, but from the fact that the airlines are really taking a hit. That's one of the things they really didn't need to hear about that737MAX.</p><p>Where do you think that's going in terms of the ripple down effect over the next several months?</p><p>BRIAN SUMERS, SENIOR AVIATION BUSINESS EDITOR, SKIFT: Well, it's going to be a while before we know exactly. The airlines had said they expect to be flying this aircraft by about mid-August.</p><p>We now know that that's not going to happen. I think everybody in the industry thinks that would be great news if this airplane is flying again with passengers by the end of the year. And even that might be kind of a bold prediction.</p><p>Expect we'll see the airplanes flying in the United States first, because regulators have been a little bit friendlier to Boeing here, and maybe the rest of the world afterward. But nothing is imminent.</p><p>NEWTON: And the point is they're going to take some hits for that financially. They already have.</p><p>SUMERS: Yes, the airlines are going to take hits from that financially. The good news is long term, Boeing should make them whole. Airlines are expecting to get compensation from Boeing. It's going to take a while. They will probably get it.</p><p>One of the bigger problems that airlines have in the short term is consumer confidence. Right? So regulators can clear the airplane, you know, as soon as they want, but people do not want to fly in this airplane. They're skittish. They're scared.</p><p>I found it very interesting at the Paris Air Show today to see Boeing actually come out and say, you know, we're humbled by this. We're surprised. You may remember a couple of months ago, they took a very hard stance.</p><p>NEWTON: I do.</p><p>SUMERS: So it's been a big change for them.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it has been a big change, and I have to say you're absolutely right. I think any one of us flying even though we're not flying the 737 MAX, we are looking a little bit more closely at what we are flying and making inferences from that.</p><p>Going on to Lufthansa. We just had that profit warning. What's at work there? I know they say it's a low cost environment, but it's not like they don't -- they haven't played in that playground for a long time. It seems that they have forgotten the rules somehow. Why? Why so much pressure?</p><p>SUMERS: Perhaps they have forgotten the rules a little bit but it is a very harsh competitive environment right now in Europe. Lufthansa has a low-cost subsidiary called Eurowings.</p><p>Eurowings attempts to compete with EasyJet, with Ryanair, but Eurowings has not been very successful at that. So they're all out there chasing the same customers, with like these 39 year old flights between major cities, and it is really hurting Lufthansa Group.</p><p>The interesting thing is despite the profit warning today, Lufthansa group came out and said long haul routes to the United States to Europe, they're doing just fine. You know, Frankfurt to London. That is a disaster right now.</p><p>NEWTON: We will remember that. Very quickly, Brian, I know that you look at both markets carefully. That whole low cost carrier thing has settled out in the United States. Does Europe has something to learn from that?</p><p>SUMERS: Europe probably does have something to learn from that. You'll know that there are no low cost airlines in the United States owned by big airlines.</p><p>So United Airlines had an airline maybe 15 years ago called Ted. It was United's spunky, low-cost airline. It did not work. The U.S. carriers got out of that game. Now they're just discounting some seats in the backof the aircraft. They're calling it Basic Economy. Europe didn't learn from that.</p><p>[15:10:12] SUMERS: So Lufthansa didn't say, \"We're just going to have Basic Economy. We're going to have some cheap seats in the back.\"They said, \"No, we need our own airline to compete with Ryanair and EasyJet. We're going to call it Eurowings,\" and Eurowings is going to lose a lot of money this year. It is not a good situation.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, as you said, London, Frankfurt for 50 bucks is a reality in Europe, you are not going to get any flight in that distance in the United States for 50 bucks. That is a long conjure.</p><p>SUMERS: Not very many certainly.</p><p>NEWTON: Not very many. Brian, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SUMERS: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Turning now to trade. India has slapped new tariffs on American goods, yes, taking on the U.S., this includes almonds, apples and some chemicals. The Indian government says it's retaliation for U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p><p>Now all of this comes as China is lowering barriers, I said lowering barriers towards just about everyone else, except the United States.</p><p>Now, I want you to have a look at this chart from researchers at the Peterson Institute. It is incredibly interesting, because as the trade war with the U.S. has picked up, the average Chinese tariff on American goods has more than doubled. You have to compare that though with the average tariffs on goods coming from anywhere else that has actually come down.</p><p>Joining me now is ChadBown, he is one of the researchers behind those numbers. He is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. I really appreciate you being with us, Chad. This study was fascinating, strategic on China's part.</p><p>CHAD BOWN, SENIOR RESEARCHER, PETERSON INSTITUTE: Yes. And to be honest, we were a little bit surprised by the numbers as well. You know, we'd heard the story last year that the headline was, you know, in instances China was cutting its tariff on uncertain products, automobiles in the middle of the year was the big example.</p><p>But it wasn't really until we looked at the data that we saw just how widespread and deliberate China's actions here really, really were.</p><p>NEWTON: And that's the key there. I don't mean to interrupt, but that's the key there. It was deliberate. They thought we're going to keep -- yes, go ahead.</p><p>BOWN: Yes, it really is deliberate. You know, it's as if the Chinese have recognized that when they retaliate against United States, this is going to be them imposing costs on themselves.</p><p>And one way that they can seek to minimize those costs is by cutting their tariffs toward everybody else, creating opportunities for their consumers, to go out and find other trading relationships with Canada or with Europe or Japan, and make it a little bit easier now that they're going to be facing tariffs from stuff coming in from the United States.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. And you make very clear, this is all within the WTO umbrella. I have to ask you, though, in terms of how much legs this new strategymaybe. Let's say in a couple of months, we do get a trade deal, between China and the U.S.?</p><p>I keep arguing that look, the hangover could last years, maybe even decades, meaning the Chinese won't forget this. Do you see that perhaps even trickling down to -- we were just talking about aviation? Take them. You know, it is essentially a duopoly. You've got Boeing and Airbus.</p><p>Could the Chinese -- one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world -- say, \"Yes, we're never going to order a Boeing plane again.\"</p><p>BOWN: Yes, Boeing and Airbus, I think are probably a little bit different. You know, they have so many Boeing in their fleetthat they're going to need to service those and get parts for those and have an ongoing relationship with Boeing for years and probably decades to come.</p><p>But for a lot of other products, that's really not the case, and once Chinese consumers get the taste of, you know, say Canadian lobster or or Japanese salmon and move away from the American products, they may never go back.</p><p>So I agree with you. There may be some long term hangover effects of all these tariffs, even if we were to get a deal sometime soon.</p><p>NEWTON: So interesting. Okay, we talked about the Chinese consumers, let's go to those American consumers. It has been a point of contention at the White House, and yet would you say that basically, it's the American consumer that's going to suffer through this trade war?</p><p>BOWN: So far, that's what the evidence has found. So we do have a couple of academic studies that have looked at this question. Obviously, President Trump denies it. He says that the foreigners are paying the costs of his tariffs. But it doesn't seem to be true in the data.</p><p>And this next round of tariffs that he has on tap, he's got $300 billion of more imports from China lined up with 25 percent tariffs that are going to be coming on, it's really going to hit the consumer products -- the shoes, the clothes, the toys, the iPhone products.</p><p>So I think for the American consumer, the impact of President Trump's trade wars is actually only going to get worse.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that is not good news for American consumers, especially as the Trump administration says that yes, that's a good likelihood these new tariffs will be a reality check.</p><p>Thanks so much. Really important research. We will come back to you because I'm sure you guys will have more on this out in the next few weeks. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now catching up to a crisis, Google CEO says YouTube must do more to police hate. SundarPichai is speaking exclusively to CNN.</p><p>[15:17:33] NEWTON: Apple's CEO is calling out Silicon Valley's social media companies and warning the next generation of engineers, they'll be judged by what they build.</p><p>Now it was a commencement address at Stanford. Tim Cook made some not so subtle references to the misinformation and hate speech scandals at Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>Now, he warned the graduates before you take credit for any innovation, be prepared take full responsibility for what he calls unintended consequences.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: Too many seem to think that good intentions excuse away harmful outcomes. It feels a bit crazy that anyone should have to say this. But if you've built a chaos factory, you can't dodge responsibility for the chaos.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Okay, he was talking about YouTube there and interesting that the CEO of Google also agrees that big tech needs to take more responsibility.</p><p>You know, funny he also used the word unintended consequences. Now, that includes him saying Google's own service as we were saying, YouTube, which has struggled to define what is the line between free expression and hate speech.</p><p>SundarPichai says YouTube must do better to police hate. he spoke exclusively with CNN's Poppy Harlow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: From anti-Semitism to harassment of LGBTQ individuals, conspiracy theory videos about the Parkland shooting or Sandy Hook. I mean, fundamentally, Sundar, where do you draw the line with YouTube between hate and free speech.</p><p>SUNDARPICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: You know it's a -- it's a line we -- you know, we work hard to get right and, you know, and every few years we feel the need to evolve them because we see changes in how the platform is getting used.</p><p>Just last week, we have significant revisions to our hate speech policy. At YouTube, we are very focused on removing harmful content and reducing the spread of what we think of as borderline content.</p><p>Just last quarter, we removed over nine million videos. And -- so it's an ongoing process. But there's more we need to do and we acknowledge that.</p><p>HARLOW: Because, in America, right, you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. And YouTube has really become our theater.</p><p>PICHAI: It is. It is the equal end of, you know, in the real world people getting together and talking. That can happen in YouTube as well. But it also allows us an opportunity to enforce rules of the road in a way we haven't being able to before as well.</p><p>[15:20:10] PICHAI: So we can use the forces underlying in YouTube and take them in a positive direction as well, which we are committed to doing.</p><p>HARLOW: So when YouTube announced these new rules, that it would take down these videos, that included taking down all of those horrible conspiracy theory videos denying the Sandy Hook massacre.</p><p>But an attorney representing 10 of the families who have family members who were killed in that said that it's too late to undo the harm and talked about the undue harassment and threat that they had sustained.</p><p>I just wonder why it took seven years to realize that those videos shouldn't be up and ads shouldn't be running next to those videos?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, I mean, it's heartbreaking for sure. And, you know, all of us, you know, would look back and, you know, be -- we wish we had gotten to the problems sooner than we did.</p><p>And, you know, there's an acknowledgement we didn't get it right. And -- but I think we became aware, collectively, of some of the pitfalls here. And, you know, since then we've been working hard. We have changed our priorities. And, you know, we have put in a lot of effort there and we'll continue to do that.</p><p>HARLOW: Tim Cook recently said, privacy in itself has become a crisis. Do you agree?</p><p>PICHAI: I think it's very, very -- you know, given the scale at which information is flowing, I don't think users have a good sense for how their data is being used.</p><p>And so I think we have put the burden on users to a large extent, and I think we need better frameworks where users get the comfort that they -- that they are in control of their data, how it's used, and they feel like they have agency over it. And so I think it's an important moment for all of us to do better here.</p><p>HARLOW: Is Google currently considering reopening search in China?</p><p>PICHAI: We have no plans to relaunch search in China.</p><p>HARLOW: You were thinking about it. You did do work inside of Google to map out what restarting search in China would look like. Are those conversations going on at all now or is there a zero percent chance that Google will restart search in China in the near term?</p><p>PICHAI: There are no plans for us to consider relaunching our search service in China. You know, we've always looked at, in a way, think about serving the next billion users.</p><p>So, as a company, you know, we -- you know, our mission compass is to provide information. So we evaluate that. You know, but, you know, we would need the right conditions to exist and so, you know, we would do it on a set of principles that matter to us.</p><p>HARLOW: And you mentioned conditions. And look at the reason Google pulled out of China in 2010 was the hack and the human rights violations that were found as a result.</p><p>But I ask because in 2016 you said, I've also thought Google was for everyone, and that applies to China, too. And you talked about serving Chinese users.</p><p>Has something shifted in you, your calculation on your willingness to even explore search in China? Is it the fact that you have, you know, according to the State Department, two million ethnic -- Muslim ethnic minorities held in camps in China, the Hong Kong protest going on? Is it -- has that shifted, fundamentally, in your view?</p><p>PICHAI: I mean there are often, you know, competing values. So, you know, we see the benefits we get when we provide information to users. But we don't want information presented in a wrong way to our users as well.</p><p>And so these are issues we grapple with, you know, across the world to be honest. You know, we comply with laws and regulations. And so, you know, it's always a set of continued conversations we have at Google.</p><p>HARLOW: But when you say conditions, it sounds like you're talking about the human rights issues in China, right?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, for us, you know, our ability to present ourselves in a way that, you know, users can see as the right provider --</p><p>HARLOW: Without censorship?</p><p>PICHAI: Without censorship, is an important condition there.</p><p>HARLOW: So is any level of censorship okay with Google if there were search in China or are you saying it would have to be uncensored by the government?</p><p>PICHAI: You know, I don't want to speculate on a hypothetical situation. We have no plans and, you know, we are not spending time on it -- time on it today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Okay, now you can hear much more from Poppy's exclusive interview with the Google CEO on her podcast, \"Boss Files.\" Just go to cnn.com/podcast to find it.</p><p>Now, we're going to be continuing with our business agenda. We will begin the bidding. We have an iconic auction house on the block today, 275 years old, the world's oldest, largest Sotheby's biggest sale ever. Itself.</p><p>Yes, the winning bid $3.7 billion. The producers are agreed today they gave me this. This is from the gentleman in black over there. Billionaire art collector and telecoms entrepreneur, PatrickDrahi and with our sale today, we mark the end of Sotheby's three decades -- count them three -- as a public company apparently Matt Egan, it could not happen soon enough for Sotheby's.</p><p>[15:25:10] NEWTON: Patrick Drahi, this is so interesting, he paid a 60 percent premium for this company, what does he know that the rest of us are missing in this market?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right. You know, I think rather than this being an acquisition of what it is like an undervalued property, which is like what you normally think about in a go-private deal, this is really a trophy asset that Patrick Drahiis buying.</p><p>If you look at what he said, he said that this is something that he wants him and his family to own for many years to come, the CEO of Sotheby's talks about how he thinks that Patrick Drahi is going to own this for decades. Drahisaid that he's not going to make any changes to the management or to the company's strategy.</p><p>So this is not a type of situation where we think that this is going to get flipped over in a couple of years, and they are going to add on, you know, are they going to cut cost or anything like that.</p><p>This seems more like a legacy play for Patrick Drahi.</p><p>NEWTON: That's such a good way to put it right, that trophyasset and from Sotheby's reaction, you kind of got the sense that, thank goodness, finally, we're out of this public market, right?</p><p>EGAN: That's right. I mean, the stock is up almost 60 percent and, you know, we saw the company say that the reason why they want to go private is because this will give them the flexibility to accelerate their turnaround plan.</p><p>And in other words, they just want to kind of get away from the harsh scrutiny of the Wall Street analysts and journalists and the shareholders.</p><p>And so they think that their life, their long-term success will be better as a private company.</p><p>NEWTON: It's interesting, and I'm sure a lot of our viewers have heard a lot about the art market in the last little while. I mean, even people like David Bowie, who you would never think of had a prolific art collection. And I hate to tell you, he made tons of money on it over the years. Does this thing say something more though, about art as an investment as we go through the decades?</p><p>EGAN: I think it might be. I mean, if you look at how much the value on some of these pieces of art have increased in just a short amount of time, it really is pretty stunning.</p><p>In some ways. It is a reflection of this low and zero and even negative interest rate environment where people are forced to kind of go out on the risk spectrum in order to get returns and Patrick Drahi is figuring rather than just going out and buying another piece of art, I'm going to just go acquire an art house itself.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it might be a very good move. You want to do the gavel the last time. The producers will never let me have it again. It's only because, you know, Richard -- they felt sorry for me because Richard won't let me touch the bell. So there you go.</p><p>Matt, thanks so much. Really fascinating story.</p><p>EGAN: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Up next, public hearings about tariff pain. U.S. companies are telling lawmakers on Capitol Hill that they are the ones feeling the heat in the Trump administration's ongoing tariff war.</p><p>[15:30:00] PAULA NEWTON, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Paula Newton, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, main street is heading to Capitol Hill, some of America's largest companies are taking their tariff case to Washington. And we'll pay tribute to the heiress who made a new fortune on her own terms. Gloria Vanderbilt who died today.</p><p>First though, these are the headlines on CNN at this hour. Egypt's first democratically elected president has died. State media say 67-year-old Mohamed Morsi had a heart attack during a court appearance today. Morsi had been in prison since 2013 when he was overthrown in a military coup. Human rights watch is accusing the government of denying him adequate medical attention.</p><p>At least 30 people were killed and 39 others injured in three suicide bombings in Nigeria. Two bombers were boys and one girl. No one has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram terrorists have carried out deadly attacks in Borno State where Sunday's blasts occurred. The EU says it expects Iran to continue to comply with an international nuclear agreement despite a new ultimatum.</p><p>Iran says it will exceed its stockpile of enriched low-grade uranium in 10 days if European powers don't help Tehran side-step those crippling U.S. sanctions. Corporate America is having its say on the prospect of more tariffs against China.</p><p>Hundreds of company executives and trade groups are set to testify this week in Washington. Best Buy and New Balance are among the companies testifying Monday, questioning the wisdom of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. Now, as that trade war escalates, more and more American importers are taking decisive action to avoid paying the higher cost. Our Clare Sebastian went to meet one of them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARNOLD KAMLER, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, KENT INTERNATIONAL: Aluminum handle bar, aluminum handle bar stem, aluminum suspension fork, this is all from China.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER (voice-over): For Arnold Kamler, this is no longer just an eight-speed mountain bike. It's a reminder almost every part of his business is caught up in the U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>(on camera): Would these have all been subject to tariffs?</p><p>KAMLER: These -- everything in this building.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Kent International is one of the largest bicycle and bike part wholesalers in the U.S., supplying Wal-Mart, Amazon and other major retailers.</p><p>KAMLER: So on a million-dollar shipment which is a normal shipment for us, where a year ago, we would have paid $110,000 of import duties, this year it'd be $360,000 of import duties. So, it's quite expensive to handle.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): So expensive that after more than three decades of manufacturing and sourcing in China, he's shifting gears.</p><p>KAMLER: We don't want to move away from our main suppliers, and so we're working together to build a fairly substantial factory in Cambodia, it's their money, it's a little bit of our help and advice.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Kent is part-owned by its Chinese manufacturing partner. Last year, they purchased this plot of land in Cambodia and when hopes of a trade deal fell apart in early May, construction plans were fast-tracked. They now hope to have the factory completed by early next year. Kent is just a small part of what experts say is one of the biggest shifts in global supply chains in years accelerated by tariffs.</p><p>PETE GUARRAIA, PARTNER, BAIN &amp; COMPANY: For the last decade or practically two decades, China has been the factory of the world, and we've seen everything shift there from nails to cell phones. What's happening now is people are stepping back and saying his labor rates are increasing and there's uncertainty with tariffs, we need to rethink the sort of nature of the totality of our supply chain.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Shoe designer Steve Madden, GoPro, even iPhone maker Foxconn are all shifting or considering shifting some production away from China to avoid the tariffs.</p><p>KAMLER: It's a beautiful front suspension mountain bike.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Arnold Kamler says the irony is before the tariffs hit, he wanted to move more production back to the U.S., expanding this assembly plant he set up in South Carolina in 2014. The tariffs on parts have made that too expensive.</p><p>[15:35:00] KAMLER: We believe that we have the opportunity to bring back the American bicycle industry which was decimated by China 25 and 30 years ago, and bring it all back here, but we need some help from the government.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, for now, this century-old family business is heading into uncharted ground. Clare Sebastian, CNN, Parsippany, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, the consumer tech association is a group that promotes innovation to spur economic growth and create those all-important jobs. Gary Shapiro is the CEO and he joins me now live from Washington. I mean, look, we've been battling this back and forth for a while. How catastrophic would this be at this point if it becomes a reality, the extra 25 percent?</p><p>GARY SHAPIRO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CONSUMER TECH ASSOCIATION: Well, it's very harmful not only to U.S. businesses, but also to American consumers. It will cost the average family of four about $2,300 a year extra, it would hurt GDP growth by about 1 percent, and it would put taxes or tariffs and all sorts of products we buy and use for back to school like laptops, tablets, computers, and also TV sets.</p><p>And 25 percent tariffs is a lot of money for each of those products.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, Gary, the White House knows all that. Why do you think they persist in going through this way? And I mean, the administration is saying that the 25 percent -- get used to it. it could be a reality, it might happen.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, part of me likes to think this is just a negotiating tactic to clean up some of the practices that China has had which we all agree are a real problem for American companies trying to do business. The other just might be something where we just want to isolate China.</p><p>But ironically, even if that's the case, we're forcing China to develop their own businesses rather quickly. Look at what we're doing to our chip companies. We have several chip companies leading the world, dominating, selling to all sorts of Chinese companies and we're forcing basically China to start replicating what they're doing, figuring it out much quicker than they would have otherwise and becoming even more economically powerful.</p><p>So, if we go forward in July with these 25 percent tariffs, we will see a harmful impact on our major American companies for American consumers and of course, for all sorts of consumer technology, footwear, so many different types of companies --</p><p>NEWTON: Sure --</p><p>SHAPIRO: And industries will be affected.</p><p>NEWTON: And I think many people believe that, Gary, but I think some are wondering, will it work? I mean, I know in the letter to the president, that you know, you guys clearly stated that tariffs are not an effective tool to change China's unfair trade practices.</p><p>But is that really true? Because even if we go back to what happened in Mexico the other week, some would argue if you don't play hard ball, you are never going to change -- you'll never have a change in the game.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, CNN had the first story about this letter that's literally hundreds of groups and companies signed. We're trying to -- we're asking our government to preserve our businesses, basically. There are business models set up where you have final assembly somewhere, you're importing components or you're doing something where you need these products.</p><p>And if you're going to do something like this, as harsh as this, don't do it so suddenly. And it's one thing that threatens something which we didn't -- we wouldn't advocate, there're other tools. There's so many different trade agreements that we could be involved with that will help the situation where there's the World Trade Organization where we've slowed down the process by resolving disputes where we -- U.S. usually wins them to the group of countries which were competing with China which got together the Trans-Pacific Partnership --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>SHAPIRO: And we pulled out of it, and we shouldn't be doing that, we should be approaching this much more logically rather than burdening businesses, burdening Americans, affecting GDP, affecting almost 1 million American jobs, putting them at risk and adding all sorts of new costs because tariffs are taxes, that's what they are, and this is going to hurt the economy.</p><p>So, you're saying perhaps that it's a great thing to threaten. But my dad taught me, if you're going to threaten something, you have to be willing to carry it out. And President Trump has shown, he's willing to carry it out. We already have 25 percent tariffs --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>SHAPIRO: Unlimited group of products who closed the government down. This is not a guy that just threatens without something behind it, and I think China knows it and hopefully there'll be an agreement.</p><p>NEWTON: And very quickly, I've got to go, Gary. But do you think, speaking out this week will make a difference?</p><p>SHAPIRO: It has to make a difference. We have an ad campaign, we're filing today with the United States Trade Representative, we're testifying next week, of course, along with hundreds of others. But the fact there are so many people in businesses are affected by this.</p><p>This could cause what we might call the Trump recession because it is such a powerful impact on a major --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>SHAPIRO: Part of the economy.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, we'll see if it works from your point of view, Gary, thanks so much, we'll check back in with you.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Now, once a staple of many traders worked days, it seems the lunch time temple, we should call it a temple was on the way out. I'll speak to the CEO of the London Metal Exchange about his company's decision -- yes, extraordinary, revolutionary, to ban drinking on the job. Yes, you all drink here, don't you?</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: All right, really hard to measure, but the U.S. markets are starting off a big week on a positive note. Of course, they are waiting on that big Fed watch. The policy statement comes out on Wednesday, but this is the issue many people believe that Jerome Powell has already opened the door to rate cuts.</p><p>Now, amid all the uncertainty, investors are fleeing to safety. What is safety, of course? Gold. Gold prices are trading near their highest levels in a year. Matthew Chamberlain is the CEO of London Metal Exchange and he joins me now live from London. Thanks so much for joining us. OK, true or false, volatility is my friend?</p><p>MATTHEW CHAMBERLAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LONDON METAL EXCHANGE: True.</p><p>NEWTON: Guilty as charged. Listen, in terms of developing this market, and really, I think you wanted it to evolve into what it should be. What should it be? Because I think if you talk to a lot of investors, they are very skittish about this market in general.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: Yes, I think across the metals' complex, particularly the base metals which are the core of what we do, but also our new precious initiative. I think there are three big drivers that we're seeing. So, there is the fundamental demand which for many of our metals, copper, aluminum still seems quite robust.</p><p>There are the technical signals and particularly driven by global trade flows and a number of the issues you covered in your previous segment around the impact of tariffs. And then there is the macro-economic impact because we shouldn't forget, I mean, you talked about gold, but also copper as well, tend to be macro-economic bellwethers where there is a lot of signals coming in from other markets into metals so they take on a significant beyond their pure commodity status.</p><p>And so, I think a combination of those three factors have certainly driven volatility over the past months, and have made it a very exciting market to trade.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and exciting because that volatility obviously comes with a lot of opportunities. I want to get specifically to this precious market that you were telling us about. We are used to in this new tech age about hearing this or that metal is in short supply.</p><p>That one country or the other company controls the full supply or something or the other. What do you think your market will do in terms of really impacting what we have come to know as that rare or precious metals market?</p><p>[15:45:00] CHAMBERLAIN: Well, so with the core precious metals, so gold and silver that they tend to have significant sources of supply across the world. I think where it gets quite interesting is the rare earths which I think may be -- may be what you're discussing there as well. Where there are more limited sources of supply.</p><p>Now, most of the rare earths don't really trade on exchange at the moment. So, they tend to be priced more in the OTC market. But I think a number of the concerns that we have seen around potential supply shortage, perhaps the impact of broader national political actions on the availability of those metals will make their pricing environment more -- put it more into focus over the coming years and certainly a number of those metals we're actively looking at whether it would be possible to help -- to help the market price and risk manage those materials.</p><p>NEWTON: And we will definitely see the evolution of that. The other thing that has evolved apparently is the drinking policy. It came as a surprise to many of us that you actually had to explain to people that they shouldn't be drinking. I want to take away all the cultural moral, is I mean, of course, in Europe, a glass of wine was lunch, is you know, it's a normal thing to do. But why did you actually have to change the policy and tell them?</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: Yes, so I think it's important to see this as the culmination of several years of evolution of behavioral and conduct standards in our market. And that's not just something the exchange has driven. It's also something that our members have driven and they're very much partners in this endeavor.</p><p>So I think over the past few years, there has been a change in attitude and you're right. You know, people will go and have a glass of wine with lunch, perhaps when entertaining clients, et cetera, and people will go and have beers with colleagues in the evening. And the last thing that we want to do is to impact people's personal freedom, their personal liberty to go and enjoy themselves in the way they'd like.</p><p>But there are certain functions on our market that are so important, they have to be done well, and they have to be done in an environment that everybody can look at and say they're comfortable with the conduct --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: And trading on our ring, which is the last open outcry trading floor in Europe is one of those things.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: So what we've said is, we'd like to formalize the rule that you shouldn't drink before conducting trade?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and in that environment you could see how things could get out of hand, I hope all that evolution goes with perhaps having some more women there trading as well. We'll wait to hear back from you on that one.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: Absolutely --</p><p>NEWTON: OK --</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: Diversity is very important --</p><p>NEWTON: We'll have to leave it there, thanks so much. We now turn to India where farming forms a crucial part of the economy, but current irrigation methods are expensive and difficult to maintain all year round. A start-up called Khethworks is stepping in with a sun-powered solution. CNN's John Defterios has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR (voice-over): Agriculture is vital to the Indian economy, 70 percent of the billion-plus population lives in rural areas, reliant upon farming to survive. For farmers to maximize their capacity to earn a living, water is crucial. Right now, rural farmers rely on expensive diesel pumps, but MIT graduates behind company Khethworks have engineered a solar solution here in Pune, India.</p><p>(on-camera): How did the idea of a solar-driven pumping system actually come to the fore?</p><p>KATIE TAYLOR, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, KHETHWORKS: People were saying we need to irrigate year-round, and we can't afford to do it with diesel fuel or kerosene fuel.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: What would you say is the primary motivation of what you're trying to do here?</p><p>TAYLOR: Our number one motive is simply to enable small-holder farmers to grow more, earn more and provide more for their families and their communities.</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice-over): It's not just the cost of energy, but access to water all year long, during the dry season, many of the farmers leave and actually seek jobs in manufacturing and mining instead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think this place looks good?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's fix it here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can get the pump connect it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: This solar pump is small, clean and easier to install. Retail cost about $540. Khethworks and the NGOs they partner with want to help farmers microfinance the equipment over time.</p><p>(on camera): Is it time to think differently and get away from diesel and kerosene?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they're using diesel and kerosene pump, then it is worse. It's the era of solar and renewable energies. It's a sustainable way for the farming, it's a one-time cost and there's no maintenance occurs in the solar pump basically.</p><p>[15:50:00] You know, money problems --</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Plans for expansion are in play.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These are the potential areas for installation of solar pumps.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Today, grain and sugar cane farmers are beneficiaries, but there is potential for the fish and dairy industries as well. John Defterios, CNN, Pune, India.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: \"Be glorious.\" That was Gloria Vanderbilt's advice to women everywhere. Now they are remembering and celebrating her life.</p><p>NEWTON: From poor little rich girl to fashion designer and business woman. The world is remembering and celebrating the life of Gloria Vanderbilt. She died Monday at the age of 95. She was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer earlier this month. Now, her son, CNN's Anderson Cooper, says she was determined to make a name for herself on her own terms.</p><p>Famous from childhood, she came from one of America's wealthiest and most storied families. Not only a socialite and heiress, Gloria Vanderbilt was a pioneer in designer jeans, yes she invented that, it was a market in the late '70s and the early '80s. Booth Moore is the executive editor of \"Women's Wear Daily\" and she joins me now live from Los Angeles.</p><p>I am more than old enough to remember those ads, and I have to say in thinking about her, I still remember her still as a woman whose life you wanted, and that's an interesting thing because when you think this was before Martha Stewart, this was before Tory Burch.</p><p>BOOTH MOORE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, WOMEN'S WEAR DAILY: Yes, it was before the Beverly Hills \"House Wives\" going on TV and selling skinny girl margarita mix and shape-wear. She really was a visionary marketer, and used that in a bunch of different categories, but most famously in Denim.</p><p>She was a key pioneer in the designer Denim market in the U.S. and even Calvin Klein kind of tips his hat to her and says she was the first. She had the foresight to know that she could use her famous name on the most basic of American garments. The humble blue jean and elevate it to a status symbol.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and I think most people don't realize to actually brand the blue jean back then. Yes, you had the Wrangler and the Levi's, but no, this was different, this was high-end, then for that reason, it was much different. You know, Sheila Evans who did the documentary about her life called her a disruptor, a disruptor. Do you think that's true?</p><p>MOORE: I do. I think that, you know, she had become a tabloid fixture at a very young age, and she was determined to kind of turn that around and to make herself a successful businesswoman.</p><p>[15:55:00] And you know, let's not forget that this was the 1970s. That was still somewhat pioneering then. And you know, she saw that she could fund her artistic endeavors by having this huge empire by making money off of her name, and certainly her approach to Denim was interesting because it was kind of this -- creating this aspirational luxury that now we talk about so much in fashion where you kind of have a little bit of the park avenue gloss of her on your own derriere, she used to say.</p><p>NEWTON: Quintessential. You know, she was quite an artist in her own right and certainly appreciated that kind of a thing in terms of actually that culture and appreciating something beautiful for what it was. Do you think it was feminist in a way because certainly as many people point out, she had enough money, there was no reason she had to go out and make a name for herself and yet, she was a businesswoman before you could even coin the term.</p><p>MOORE: Absolutely. I think that, you know, she wanted to have success on her own terms, as you said, and also you know, we heard her make comments like, you know, there's something to be said for money that you make on your own. And at one time she was making millions of dollars off of her clothing, and that way she was able to do things like paint and write books and all these other things that made her such a renaissance woman.</p><p>And I really think she was a woman of her time and as time changed, she changed. I think it's remarkable that she -- you know, in the 1950s was linked to a number of famous men, and including, you know, Gordon Parks who was --</p><p>NEWTON: Right --</p><p>MOORE: An African-American photographer. I think it's amazing that she wrote an erotic novel at age 85, I mean, talking --</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, she broke a lot -- yes --</p><p>MOORE: Talking about breaking boundaries, yes --</p><p>NEWTON: She broke a lot of boundaries, that is for sure. Thanks so much, I really appreciate it and of course --</p><p>MOORE: Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON: We know that our colleague and friend Anderson Cooper will of course miss her as well. She will be remembered as an artist, a designer and a mother. Gloria Vanderbilt was 95 years old.</p><p>NEWTON: We are moments away from the closing bell. As you can see there, Wall Street losing a little bit of momentum today, the Dow has come off the highs and we'll call it flat. So that's it for now, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton in for Richard Quest, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061701cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-S8V1-JB20-G34R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 17, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002NKZ</classCode><className>SOTHEBY'S</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0004Z1F</classCode><className>QATAR AIRWAYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0008Z4K</classCode><className>AIRBUS SAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS454390 OTHER DIRECT SELLING ESTABLISHMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC5963 DIRECT SELLING ESTABLISHMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Maar nu Facebook ook in de VS een miljardenboete boven het hoofd hangt, lijkt het tij te keren. Want ook in Amerika moet de  big tech zich aan steeds meer en strengere regels houden.</p><p>Facebook heeft drie miljard dollar opzijgezet omdat het een boete verwacht van de Amerikaanse Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Sinds begin dit jaar doen geruchten de ronde over een sanctie, omdat Facebook niet omzichtig omspringt met de data van zijn gebruikers. Het zou de eerste Amerikaanse boete ooit voor Facebook worden, en meteen ook de grootste boete voor een techbedrijf die de FTC ooit oplegde. Volgens Facebook zal het bedrag ergens \u00adtussen 3 en 5 miljard dollar landen. Ter vergelijking: in 2012 moest Google van de FTC 22,5 miljoen dollar boete betalen toen het de regels overtrad.</p><p>De monsterboete zou dan ook een nieuw tijdperk inluiden. Boetes voor Amerikaanse techbedrijven leken eerder iets waar vooral de Europese Unie zich in bekwaamde. Denk maar aan de drie miljardenboetes tegen Google (2,4 miljard euro in 2017, 4,3 miljard euro in 2018 en 1,49 miljard euro in 2019). Het harde optreden van Europa werd door tal van Amerikanen, onder wie voormalig president Barack Obama, weggezet als Europese afgunst en protectio\u00adnisme, omdat Europa niet in staat zou zijn om zulke grote techbedrijven voort te brengen.</p><p>De acties van de FTC maken duidelijk dat  big tech ook in de VS almaar meer aangeschoten wild is. \"In de VS zie je almaar meer regels en wetten\", zegt Leighton Andrews, professor aan de Cardiff Business School. Hij is gespecialiseerd in regulering van \u00adsocialemediabedrijven en werkt aan een boek over Facebook. \"De stemming is dat je niet op Facebook kunt vertrouwen om zichzelf binnen de perken te houden. Er waren te veel incidenten, te veel beloften, te veel loze woorden.\" Volgens hem beschouwt de FTC Facebook intussen als een  serial offender - een recidivist.</p><p>De verwachte miljardenboete kadert in een onderzoek van de FTC over hoe Facebook met data van zijn \u00adgebruikers omgaat. In 2011 sloot het daarover een overeenkomst met de regulator. Gebruikers zouden onder meer \"nadrukkelijke toestemming\" moeten geven vooraleer hun data kunnen worden gedeeld met andere partijen. Maar tal van schandalen, en dan vooral het verhaal rond Cambridge Analytica, maakten duidelijk dat Facebook zich niet aan de af\u00adspraken hield.</p><p>Peanuts</p><p>Toch lijkt Facebook niet wakker te liggen van 3 miljard dollar. Het \u00adbedrijf heeft een cashberg van zo'n 44 miljard dollar, en de resultaten in het eerste kwartaal van dit jaar waren uitstekend. De koers ging na de aankondiging met 8 procent omhoog. Facebook werd zo op de beurs \u00adzomaar eventjes 40 miljard dollar meer waard. \"Een boete van enkele miljarden dollars is niet meer dan een tik op de vingers voor Facebook\", stelde David Cicilline, Democratisch parlementslid voor Rhode Island, op Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HETNIE-ebfb604c676911e989882e818b2016c3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HETNIE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYY-RMV1-JDP0-507B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343657</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Corelio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Het Nieuwsblad</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61008\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Waasland Editie</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>26 April 2019 Vrijdag</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Krant</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>DUTCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>NEDERLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Discretion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdERjFENTBEOTdDNENFRjk5ODNBRUJDM0MwRjc4MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUU1OTEyOTNEQ0U4NEQ1RkEwMkU0MzZCQkE0QjBBOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Federal Trade Commission Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFCREMwMjhDNjM2NDZDOTlFMkVFREFEMjVFQ0ZEOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDE1NTFGNzBDNTIyNDBEQUE2MkYwNkNCOTAzNjNGNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Federal Trade Commission Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFCREMwMjhDNjM2NDZDOTlFMkVFREFEMjVFQ0ZEOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDE1NTFGNzBDNTIyNDBEQUE2MkYwNkNCOTAzNjNGNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009RNX</classCode><className>Instant Messaging</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Back in March 2018, when commenting [3]on what was then the 2nd longest central-bank induced bull market of all time (it is now the longest ever) Bank of America's CIO Michael Hartnett pointed out that \"bull market leadership has been in assets that provide scarce 'growth' ...arce 'yield'. Specifically, the \"deflation\" assets, such as bonds, credit, growth stocks (315%), have massively outperformed inflation assets, e.g., commodities, cash, banks, value stocks (249%) since QE1. At the same time, US equities (269%) have massively outperformed non-US equities (106%) since launch of QE1.\"  And, as happens every time the Fed tries to manage asset prices, it had blown another bubble: commenting on the hyperinflation in risk assets, Hartnett said that the \"lowest interest rates in 5,000 years have guaranteed a melt-up trade in risk assets\", which the strategist had called the Icarus Trade since late 2015, noting that the latest, \"e-Commerce\" bubble, which consists of AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, TWTR, EBAY, FB, is up 617% since the financial crisis, making it the 3rd largest bubble of the past 40 years.\" </p><p>   Fast forward two years, one failed attempt at normalizing interest rates, one QE4, and one historic P/E multiple expansion meltup later, when the same bull market leadership in \"growth\" assets has led to the unprecedented result that the top 5 stocks now account for a greater share of S...0 market cap than ever before[4]    and when what in 2018 was the third largest bubble of all time only has - thanks to 800 rate cuts by central banks since the Lehman bankruptcy - now been rebranded to \"e-Commerce\" by BofA's Hartnett, and which as shown in the chart below has - after rising more than 1,000% from its crisis lows - become the single biggest asset bubble of all time.    Commenting on this biggest ever asset bubble in his latest Flow Show report, Hartnett explains it as follows:  the US dollar off to best start to year since 2015, DXY threatening to breakup toward 104 post-GFC high bullishly driven by positioning (consensus bearish US$), politics (probability of Trump or Bloomberg victory in US presidential election at fresh high of 77% according to poll aggregator Oddschecker.com), and bubble with global capital flowing to US tech disruption bubble.  Ironically, and confirming the barbell strategy pursued by investors, even as global capital floods into the \"growth\" sector, a \"twin bubble\" continues to grow, with inflows into bonds seemingly neverending, and just this week investors poured the most money ever into IG corporate bonds ($13.4BN)    in addition to a $1.2BN inflow into tech funds, despite broader FTC \"Big Tech\" antitrust action into what is now America's least regulated sector:    Meanwhile, easing COVID-19 fears have lent a strong weekly bid to HY corporate bonds ($3.4bn), EM equity ($2.7bn), ... debt ($2.1bn). In short investors appear to be buying anything that is not nailed down, resulting in record annualized inflows into bond and equity funds.    Of course, the bubble may be the biggest ever, but the action observed now is hardly new, and there is a familiar word to describe what is going on: distribution as the smartest and richest money in the room - private clients - continue to quietly sell stocks to retail investors even as the buy more and more and more bonds.    Putting it all together, what does Hartnett - who like Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson - has been reluctantly bullish into this meltup, think happens next, and when will he finally sell? His answer below:  We stay \"irrationally bullish\" in Q1: positioning not yet \"euphoric\" ...d caught in \"liquidity trap\"; we expect rising probability of a \"Minsky moment\" to coincide with peak positioning ...ak liquidity in Q2 triggering \"big top\" in risk assets; sell S...0 when PE &gt;20X, go short credit ...ocks when new lows in bond yields ...$ appreciation becomes disorderly bearish signaling tighter Fed liquidity ...arking recession/default fears.

In this screenshot from a Facebook page, a search result for \"solar energy governor\" in Facebook's Ad Archive shows false ads.APAP</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of ads on Facebook promised U.S. homeowners that they were eligible for huge state tax breaks if they installed new solar-energy panels. There was just one catch: None of it was true. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor - and sometimes President Donald Trump - to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those incentives don't exist. </p><p>While the ads didn't aim to bilk people of money directly - and it wasn't possible to buy solar panels through these ads - they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, both scammy and legitimate. It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. </p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state government officials who noticed the ads. </p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt Internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom. </p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\" </p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms. </p><p>Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on political ads it runs, including who bought them and the age and gender of the audience. But it didn't make that information available for other ads until Thursday, when it announced it was expanding the database to include all active ads. Twitter offers its own database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only. </p><p>The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is the fact that ads can be targeted so narrowly that journalists and watchdog groups often won't see them. </p><p>\"That allows people to do more dirty tricks,\" said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program. </p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them. </p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\" </p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. </p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\" </p><p>Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them. </p><p>Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to re-appear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time. </p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\" He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but he worried others might not be. </p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said. </p><p>The Associated Press found that some of these ads directed people to solar-energy websites that listed the same business address - a mailbox in Carlsbad - that had been used by a company once under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the government's consumer protection agency. In 2012, the FTC sued Jason Akatiff and his company - then called Coleadium, also known as Ads 4 Dough - for running fake news websites that marketed unfounded health benefits of colon cleanse and acai berry products, according to court records. </p><p>Akatiff settled the allegations without admitting guilt and agreed to a $1 million fine. Akatiff changed his company's name to A4D Inc. in 2015, according to California business filings. </p><p>Akatiff did not respond to messages left with his California business. </p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers. </p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. </p><p>The scammers sell the personal information they collect to other companies looking for potential customers, Marinello said. \"That's how this whole process plays out.\" </p><p>Seitz and Anderson write for The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0093226070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT3-0FT1-DY37-F2P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is a simplistic summary of how the data-based economy has evolved till date. In future, India is poised to play a critical role in the data sweepstakes. India can choose market distortionary regulations which appear rewarding in the short run, or a new approach of platform interoperability; business self-regulation; and enhanced individual agency. This bold new approach is likely to serve India better than a more traditional policy toolkit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, we simply do not have the luxury of timid, incremental policy changes because the world around us is changing dramatically. Over the last five years, Facebook's active monthly users have nearly doubled from 1.3B to 2.4B. During this time, India has added 250 million mobile phone subscribers - a number nearly equalling the size of Indonesia's population. These trends can create a foundation of services to catalyse businesses, empower citizens and improve governance. But while these benefits have been tangible, the risks have also become all too evident.</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated how unethical actors can exploit poor privacy policies to influence elections. Similarly, the number of data accounts breached in the United States has gone from 86 million in 2013 to 446 million in 2018 - throwing light on the risks to cybersecurity and individual privacy.</p><p>It is against this complex play of the global digital economy that the new BJP Government will determine the regulatory direction India takes. Over the next five years, the next wave of hundreds of millions of internet users will likely come online in India. By 2022, Indians will be using 646 million gigabytes of data per day, which is 490% higher than it was a year back. The government will need to respond to these tectonic shifts. But why should it look for bold new policy ideas?</p><p>Historically, Asian economies have responded to tech innovation emanating from the West. This has usually taken the form of constraining US tech and making them more amenable to serving national interest. China is the leading example of this approach, having forced tech companies to modify their products to suit the Chinese Government's priorities. For example, Apple has removed VPNs from its Chinese app store, and also stores Chinese users' data in government-linked servers. While China is an extreme example, developing countries feel a legitimate need to avoid a new age of \"data colonialism\".</p><p>But India doesn't need to follow the same protectionist impulses. There is an alternative bigger-picture approach - one that India, with its large market size, democratic polity and deep tech talent is especially well placed to undertake. Indeed, instead of being reactive to US tech, India can be proactive and fundamentally reshape internet governance. It can take the lead and help solve some of the issues that the US and Europe are grappling with.</p><p>Take the example of regulating technology giants like Google and Facebook. The most popular policy proposals, like breaking up these companies or taxing them higher, are part of a traditional policy toolkit. India can consider something more revolutionary. For example, tech platforms can be mandated to adhere to a uniform set of standards that allow users on one platform to interact with those on another. Imagine the user of an Indian social media start-up interacting with her friends on Facebook. Or an Ola user booking cabs on Uber.</p><p>Such platform interoperability will enable Indian start-ups to compete with American tech companies on a more equal footing. American big tech companies will be unable to monopolise Indians' data the way they do today. There is ample precedence for such an approach. For example, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) created an analogous infrastructure in the payments space, thus greatly expanding access to financial services and creating a level playing field.</p><p>Enforcement of privacy laws is another area in which India can lead the world. American and European regulators are struggling to identify and respond to privacy violations in a timely manner. After all, a privacy regulator's mandate is theoretically infinite - it regulates each and every organisation in a country. India should therefore explore self-regulation, where the burden of compliance is largely borne by the entity being regulated. Successful self-regulation schemes are based on clearly defined objectives, processes, and outcomes. Transparency is paramount - individuals should be able to detect and punish any deviation from appropriate behaviour.</p><p>Evidence shows that such measures are effective. For example, mandatory data breach notification requirements were seen to reduce cases of identity thefts in US states. The Government can encourage simple visual cues (like a star rating) that reflects the data practices of companies, so that individuals can choose what kind of companies they want to give their data to. The Government can also mandate easier to read privacy policies. Experimental research has shown that aggressively trimming these policies to only a few essential facts - those least expected by consumers - and presenting them in a standardised, nontechnical and easily comparable format, enhances a user's understanding of these policies.</p><p>The renewed mandate to the Government, presents India with two paths. One path is defensive, outdated and won't allow India to reap the potential of its technology talent or consumer power. Like China, we can seek to cage the tech giants emanating from Silicon Valley. The other path involves taking innovative and bold steps that reshape the data economy in a way that empowers citizens while serving the Government's legitimate aims. While the second is more difficult, the time to allow innovative technology to reshape the data economy is now. This road less travelled will help fulfil Prime Minister's call on 26 May this year for India to regain her rightful position in the world order.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from New Delhi Times.

(She emailed the banks and agencies involved, and then reached for a beer - yes, in that order.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While this grievance is a personal matter - and resolved somewhat through a few cash vouchers - it does bring to mind the bigger, broader trend of \"open banking\" that banks are looking at closely.</p><p>The over-arching idea behind the \"open banking\" concept is for banks to open up their services to partners, typically through the use of application programming interfaces, or APIs - a set of commands that allow software applications to speak to one another.</p><p>In the UK, the methods of implementing \"open banking\" have gone to the extent of giving consumers an easy switch to turn on and off access to their banking information that is given to banks and other financial firms such as fintech companies. It also implies that consumers should be allowed to more quickly switch their primary accounts from one bank to another.</p><p>The change has been sparked in part by the European regulations in the payments space, as regulators there sought to give account holders the clear option to hand over banking information to authorised third parties - such as fintechs or smaller banks - and to make payments through these third-party firms that are presumably charging lower fees than that of the banking incumbents.</p><p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has said that this \"open banking\" model will help to create more innovative services by new entrants and technology companies, with banks meant to offer APIs, such that brands, corporates, fintechs and software developers can \"talk\" to the bank to access a breadth of services.</p><p>The \"open banking\" initiative will also prompt the banks to \"publish trustworthy and objective information on quality of service\", the authority added.</p><p>In doing so, customers can assess their banks on their service standards and charges, giving them an option to switch financial providers based on the available information.</p><p>Consumer angst</p><p>In theory, this is an achingly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, there are practical hurdles.</p><p>Firstly, information shared by banks is varied and hard to compare. A fee charge statement should be, by now, a simple and comparative piece of information. Yet, as this reporter's personal experience a few weekends showed, it is just not the case.</p><p>Consumers still have to jump through hoops to figure out how much one transaction would cost. It is worse when the front-desk staff tells you there is no charge, when actually, there would be. Heavy remains that damning paper statement that arrives after the transaction has been finalised and completed.</p><p>Secondly, that damning paper statement is not digitised, which means consumers would have to take time to transfer that information on paper onto a spreadsheet, in order to make worthwhile comparisons. (At this point, the benefits of a second beer begin to outweigh the risks of poor data entry from inebriation.)</p><p>Finally, there are security concerns. For example, as the regulators here look to raise the cyber hygiene standards of banks here, it remains less clear how fintech firms would be assessed against such higher standards.</p><p>So while there is overall irritation with banks over poor services, consumers would not necessarily be better served in having fintech firms control an outsized portion of sensitive banking data at this point, if start-ups are not held to the same cyber-security standards as banks, and as there remain practical challenges behind UK's version of \"open banking\".</p><p>But the prevalent angst of consumers is precisely the reason that the \"open banking\" philosophy is not to be scoffed at. The bigger lesson to take from the \"open banking\" experiment is that banks should be expected to be transparent about information such as fees, and in a way that is accessible and comparative.</p><p>Notably, should regulators ensure that banks have standardised terms and conditions to make them effectively machine readable, so consumers can have that crucial information at a glance through a digital portal? If the industry is to pursue the \"open banking\" concept, it's worthwhile thinking about such standardisation as a start.</p><p>The bottom line is that banks' certain failings in working to the consumers' best interest will only add fuel to the criticism of banks being fair-weather in nature.</p><p>The \"open banking\" model is still at its infancy, but the bigger takeaway from it is that banks that still do not embrace the notion of transparency and value-added service will trail far behind not just their traditional peers, but also their Big Tech foes.</p><p>And in the era of runaway competition, especially given the open competition in Asia's financial sector, that disadvantage could tomorrow bring a bank to its dusty - but deserving - end.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-206677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGY-PSH1-JCF2-83P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 7, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Authority of State Agencies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc4MzRFMzEwMEEwNDZEMTgzMjZFMjg1N0M2Q0FENTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFDOEJBNTMwMzE5NERBQjk4MUM3QjI0QjdCRTYyRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p> I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p> Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p> GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p> KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p> MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p> MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p> Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p> KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p> KISSEL:  No.</p><p> GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p> When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p> Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p> Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p> GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p> MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p> MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p> MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p> But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p> On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p> STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p> President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p> President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p> Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p> KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p> KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p> GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p> KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p> GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p> That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p> MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p> KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p> KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p> GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p> KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p> MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p> When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p> Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p> ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p> KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p> KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p> GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p> KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p> GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p> Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> -- Allysia Finley.  </p><p> You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p> ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p> GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p> FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p> FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p> But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p> Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p> GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p> We hope that's not true.  </p><p> GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p> Thank you, Allysia.</p><p> Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p> Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p> But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p> MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p> So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p> KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p> But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p> We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p> MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p> GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p> MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p> All right.</p><p> Dan?</p><p> HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> Thanks to all of you.</p><p> And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p> That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p>I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p>Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p>GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p>KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p>MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p>MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p>Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p>When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p>Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p>Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p>GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p>MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p>MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p>MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p>But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p>On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p>STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p>President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p>President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p>Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p>KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p>GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p>KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p>GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p>That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p>KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p>KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p>GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p>KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p>MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p>Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p>ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p>KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p>KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p>KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p>GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p>KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p>GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p>Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- Allysia Finley.  </p><p>You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p>ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p>GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p>FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p>FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p>But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p>Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p>GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p>We hope that's not true.  </p><p>GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p>Thank you, Allysia.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p>Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p>But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p>MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p>So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p>KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p>But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p>MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p>That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p>I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p>Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p>GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p>KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p>MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p>MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p>Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p>When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p>Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p>Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p>GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p>MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p>MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p>MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p>But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p>On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p>STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p>President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p>President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p>Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p>KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p>GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p>KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p>GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p>That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p>KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p>KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p>GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p>KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p>MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p>Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p>ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p>KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p>KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p>KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p>GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p>KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p>GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p>Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- Allysia Finley.  </p><p>You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p>ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p>GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p>FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p>FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p>But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p>Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p>GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p>We hope that's not true.  </p><p>GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p>Thank you, Allysia.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p>Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p>But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p>MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p>So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p>KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p>But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p>MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p>That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p> I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p> Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p> GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p> KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p> MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p> MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p> Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p> KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p> KISSEL:  No.</p><p> GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p> When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p> Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p> Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p> GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p> MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p> MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p> MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p> But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p> On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p> STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p> President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p> President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p> Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p> KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p> KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p> GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p> KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p> GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p> That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p> MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p> KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p> KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p> GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p> KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p> MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p> When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p> Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p> ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p> KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p> KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p> GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p> KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p> GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p> Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> -- Allysia Finley.  </p><p> You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p> ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p> GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p> FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p> FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p> But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p> Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p> GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p> We hope that's not true.  </p><p> GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p> Thank you, Allysia.</p><p> Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p> Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p> But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p> MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p> So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p> KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p> But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p> We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p> MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p> GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p> MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p> All right.</p><p> Dan?</p><p> HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> Thanks to all of you.</p><p> And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p> That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p> I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p> Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p> GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p> KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p> MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p> MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p> Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p> KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p> KISSEL:  No.</p><p> GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p> When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p> Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p> Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p> GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p> MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p> MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p> MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p> But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p> On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p> STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p> President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p> President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p> Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p> KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p> KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p> GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p> KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p> GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p> That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p> MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p> KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p> KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p> GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p> KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p> MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p> When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p> Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p> ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p> KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p> KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p> GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p> KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p> GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p> Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> -- Allysia Finley.  </p><p> You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p> ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p> GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p> FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p> FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p> But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p> Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p> GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p> We hope that's not true.  </p><p> GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p> Thank you, Allysia.</p><p> Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p> Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p> But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p> MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p> So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p> KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p> But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p> We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p> MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p> GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p> MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p> All right.</p><p> Dan?</p><p> HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> Thanks to all of you.</p><p> And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p> That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p>I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p>Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p>GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p>KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p>MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p>MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p>Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p>When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p>Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p>Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p>GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p>MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p>MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p>MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p>But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p>On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p>STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p>President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p>President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p>Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p>KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p>GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p>KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p>GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p>That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p>KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p>KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p>GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p>KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p>MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p>Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p>ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p>KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p>KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p>KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p>GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p>KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p>GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p>Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- Allysia Finley.  </p><p>You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p>ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p>GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p>FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p>FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p>But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p>Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p>GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p>We hope that's not true.  </p><p>GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p>Thank you, Allysia.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p>Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p>But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p>MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p>So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p>KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p>But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p>MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p>That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p> I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p> Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p> GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p> KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p> MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p> MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p> Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p> KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p> GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p> KISSEL:  No.</p><p> GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p> When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p> Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p> Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p> GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p> MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p> MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p> MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p> But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p> On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p> STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p> President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p> President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p> Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p> KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p> KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p> GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p> GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p> KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p> GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p> That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p> MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p> MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p> KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p> KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p> GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p> KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Right.</p><p> GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p> MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p> GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p> When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p> Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p> ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p> KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p> KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p> GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p> GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p> GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p> KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p> GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p> Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> -- Allysia Finley.  </p><p> You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p> ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p> GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p> FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p> GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p> FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p> GIGOT:  Right.</p><p> HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p> But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p> Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p> GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p> We hope that's not true.  </p><p> GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p> Thank you, Allysia.</p><p> Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p> We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p> Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p> MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p> But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p> MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p> So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p> KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p> But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p> KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p> We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p> MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p> GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p> MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p> FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p> GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p> FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p> GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p> All right.</p><p> Dan?</p><p> HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p> GIGOT:  All right.</p><p> Thanks to all of you.</p><p> And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p> That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Paul Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R. McMaster as national security advisor. This comes on the heels of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea. Does it signal a shift in the administration's foreign policy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton, \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\" Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives. Is that fair?</p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR: No, it's not fair. What I'd point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because probably that wouldn't happen.</p><p>I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo. John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo. Let me say also that he served in two presidential administrations. He served with Jim Baker in the first Bush presidency. He was undersecretary of state in the second Bush presidency. John Bolton has a lot of experience with bureaucracies. And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about North Korea, the status quo will always be careful. And John Bolton's career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability. There won't be buttons pushed here. We're not talking about that. We're talking about a national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our faces.</p><p>GIGOT: Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along with people. If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador to the United Nations. He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through the United Nations. He developed something in the second Bush administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD movements. In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about anymore.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: He got U.N. resolutions that equated Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been accomplished before.</p><p>Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them early. He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear program with the Six Party talks. He went against Condoleezza Rice, then secretary of state.</p><p>GIGOT: He was vindicated.</p><p>KISSEL: He was absolutely vindicated. He has been writing for years about the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let them have nuclear weapons. He predicted that the U.N. process that President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\" So this is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the truth about the threats to the United States. I think it's a great pick.</p><p>GIGOT: But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested. They go, oh, my god, we're headed for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North Korea. Are we?</p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: I don't think so. I think he's clear-eyed about the experience. It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the administration.</p><p>GIGOT: Right.</p><p>MCGURN: It tells you something that he's in now. And I suspect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Why do you think that is? People say it's the mustache.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's so fixated on looks.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: That's not a joke.</p><p>MCGURN: I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew Obama was weak overseas. But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars. And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp. So it says a lot. It also says a lot, look --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?</p><p>MCGURN: That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor. The national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate position. You have to get along. And I don't know all the policy differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth. So clearly there's a comfort level here. And it's interesting that President Trump would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea, said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.</p><p>GIGOT: Yes.</p><p>Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy? One of the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of completely of the Iran agreement, for example.</p><p>HENNINGER: Yes. That is up for renewal in May. I think the expectation is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May. And as Bill was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal when he was in the House of Representatives. And I think you can probably see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier. It's not going to be a stand-pat foreign policy.</p><p>GIGOT: Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?</p><p>KISSEL: Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national security advisor position. I think you have more of a deterrent there or Pyongyang to try something.</p><p>GIGOT: I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president very well as national security advisor. They didn't mesh on a personal level.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL: Yes.</p><p>GIGOT: That's not McMaster's fault.</p><p>KISSEL: No.</p><p>GIGOT: I think that gets more to the president.</p><p>When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on his legal team. What the changes say about the president's stance on the Mueller probe, next.</p><p>GIGOT: Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher pitch in Washington. John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova. The president told reporters at the White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.</p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p>Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation? Was it fundamentally about the strategy difference?</p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: I think there's a strategy difference. I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part. He was frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president. He had asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public. Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.</p><p>Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe. For instance, an obstruction charge.</p><p>GIGOT: Right.</p><p>STRASSEL: You might want some lawyers around you that are much more prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that this legal team was doing that. So this could be a moment for a shake-up that better positions the president.</p><p>GIGOT: Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to say, and you never know what he's going to remember. He may say something that he believes it true and it's entirely false.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. Lawyers love that stuff, right? I'm not a lawyer but every lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p>GIGOT: To do that, right.</p><p>MCGURN: -- because you open yourself up.</p><p>GIGOT: But the president doesn't believe that. He believes, hey, I can handle anything.</p><p>MCGURN: Right.</p><p>GIGOT: What do you think? Do you think Dowd was right?</p><p>MCGURN: I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump. One, I think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he didn't do anything wrong. There are people trying to overturn an election or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Yes. I can see all that.</p><p>MCGURN: But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to work against a presidency this way. How he handles it another matter, you know, the tweets. And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over him.</p><p>GIGOT: That's the point. Trump can believe all that and come in there with absolute certainty.</p><p>But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up. We have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they ended up getting indicted for making false statements.</p><p>HENNINGER: Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p>GIGOT: Right.</p><p>HENNINGER: -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case. It was a nightmare for Ted Olson. And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson to see whether he would join them. He declined. But nonetheless, there's an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a dangerous enterprise.</p><p>On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak. I think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in jeopardy.</p><p>GIGOT: Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe and the Russia issue. The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans, majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered. What did we learn? What are the highlights?</p><p>STRASSEL: This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this. They put out both findings and recommendations. And I think the top line answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the Trump White House and Russians in any way. That's the important thing. They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have been able to exploit. And I think this is important because we want to be looking forward here, not just back. And that is very much what the oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do. What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people they interviewed and went through. This was a very thorough investigation in the end.</p><p>GIGOT: All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these efforts to investigate themselves. Again, remember, under Donald Trump, Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.</p><p>GIGOT: Right. But do we need special counsel?</p><p>MCGURN: I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's really special, it's unconstitutional. Right? And if it's not special, what's the difference? I think what we need is for Congress and the president to exert the levers that they have. For example, there's impeachment. If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is really resisting, they could use that. There's a lot of legislative tools that they have.</p><p>President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.</p><p>GIGOT: I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel. We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p>MCGURN: Right.</p><p>GIGOT: -- we're all waiting for says. If it says something that there was bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding advice. I agree with you, your advice.</p><p>President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China with tough tariffs. How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's announcement, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Doing things for this country that should have been done for many, many years. We've had this abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United States. And we don't want that to happen. We're not going to let that happen. It's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT: President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and billions of dollars in profit. The Dow plunging more than 700 points in the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.</p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board member, Mary Kissel.</p><p>Mary, what do you make of the announcement?</p><p>KISSEL: I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know, when you start a trade war, where it's going to end. And the China have already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.</p><p>GIGOT: You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms. Is there a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously addressing, a real problem with China?</p><p>KISSEL: In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic aggression?\"</p><p>GIGOT: Yes. Yes.</p><p>KISSEL: Trump says yes. Yes. The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p>GIGOT: OK. All right.</p><p>KISSEL: They steal intellectual property. They have state champions that get subsidized loans from state-owned banks. Yes, Trump has a point. The problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American consumers. And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge. How do you punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also punishing American consumers at the same time?</p><p>GIGOT: Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that? There is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior. I've talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point, they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things were opening up. The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property. And the regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that. How do you address that if not with tariffs?</p><p>HENNINGER: You start with the understanding that doing anything is an enormous undertaking. The entire developed world is deeply invested in China. It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.</p><p>That said, you're going to need a strategy. And a strategy is not what it looks to be on offer from the Trump administration. To take on China in any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies, Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe. But you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to impose tariffs on the European Union. Now it may look like they're being exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the United States' trade strategy. One day it's on, another day it's off, and now it's targeted at China. So I think the president at this point is really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia, South Korea, japan or the European Union.</p><p>GIGOT: All right.</p><p>What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way? And if you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really ended.</p><p>MCGURN: I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break with his pro-growth tax reform policy. As we were saying, China does cheat. We've seen it. But it's very hard to hit them without hitting yourself. It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted place and it ricochets off the walls. I think China exports $1 billion worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.</p><p>GIGOT: Right.</p><p>MCGURN: Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer gets hit. It's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: But is there a real economic risk here?</p><p>MCGURN: Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are among the most uncertain. I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars. And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty. You do your thing and you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely different areas.</p><p>KISSEL: I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit. No one forced the companies to go over and do business with China. A lot of the CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for China's authoritarian regime. They thought they had great connections and they'd get a different kind of bargain. Then they woke up 10 years later and realized their intellectual property was stolen.</p><p>GIGOT: But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?</p><p>KISSEL: There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in there, Paul. I have sympathy for them. They had their intellectual property stolen. But I also don't want to let them off the hook.</p><p>GIGOT: The other thing --</p><p>KISSEL: They should have gone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: You had an arc of reform in China.</p><p>MCGURN: Right.</p><p>GIGOT: And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped. It's gone backwards.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: So, I mean --</p><p>MCGURN: It's also the phony argument on trade deficits. People that don't understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping statistics. Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. What Hong Kong and Taiwan did was export their deficits to China. The way they value something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get the full cost of it. So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else, but China gets stuck --</p><p>GIGOT: That's literally true in the case of the iPhone. All China does is assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Part of the deficit.</p><p>When we come back, Facebook under fire. CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign. Is big tech getting different treatment than it did in the Obama years?</p><p>PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: Facebook under fire this week after revelations that more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign. CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and promising to do better.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This was a major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT: Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto. He also writes the \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>Good to see you, Andy. How are you?</p><p>ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST: I'm doing great, thanks.</p><p>GIGOT: Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?</p><p>KESSLER: Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook account, which means democracy is safe again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it is, it's not going to affect their business. I mean, by now, if you use Facebook, you know your data's not safe. You know you're inundated with fake news. Yet, people still use it. And their engagement numbers have rolled over a little bit. It's mostly the younger generation moving to Instagram, which Facebook owns.</p><p>GIGOT: Facebook owns, yes.</p><p>KESSLER: So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.</p><p>GIGOT: Wait a minute. This is not a big deal then? So why are people paying so much attention to it? We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign, the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p>KESSLER: That's right.</p><p>GIGOT: -- for using that data to help their campaign. This time, Trump campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference? We don't know. So is this just politics?</p><p>KESSLER: The hypocrisy is piled high. In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\" ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\" They basically admitted they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook. And Facebook let them. The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you stop doing it on November 7th.\" So there was no backlash then. But now there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is blamed for everything. It's inequality problems, diversity problems and now swinging elections. We're in a lot different environment for these companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar valued enterprises.</p><p>GIGOT: On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500 -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization. A big chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week. So clearly the market is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not, because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come in and start to impose controls. How big a fear is that?</p><p>KESSLER: Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he wanted to be regulated. Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome regulation. I think they have to be careful what they wish.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3 billion users and they're running out of them. They're shut out of China. They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more in Russia because of the competition. And so at some point, Wall Street will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users are hard to come by. But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for Facebook. Think about it. Here's these companies that have been stealing the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections. Facebook should look at that as a profit possibility. Look at what TV networks make on campaigns. Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV campaigns. Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our data, we're going to leverage it ourselves. Near term, I look at it as a positive, as a new business opportunity.</p><p>GIGOT: But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it. And they don't pay Andy Kessler. They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Is that basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it, is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to really bad actors.</p><p>KESSLER: I think that's a huge issue for Facebook. And I think they've made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more trustworthy than those that aren't. And when he talked about regulation, he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about transparency in advertising. Well, I'd like to see a little more transparency in the content that they run, that people link to. Is this a trustworthy site? The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more trustworthy than the Onion or something like that. Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Or \"Russia Today.\" \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KESSLER: -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p>GIGOT: But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor because the market is really -- is skeptical.</p><p>KESSLER: Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market. It shoots first and asks questions later. As long as their growth continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine. Again, I worry long-term. But Facebook has been resilient. They changed their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up. It's a very addicting platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.</p><p>GIGOT: Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.</p><p>Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind? We'll ask our panel, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA: If the industry won't solve these kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation. And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT: Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far behind?</p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- Allysia Finley.</p><p>You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein. Is the Cambridge Analytica uproar overblown?</p><p>ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: It's definitely overblown. We don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica wasn't very good. Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any data that was improperly accessed.</p><p>GIGOT: So why, then, the uproar now? For years, we know Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies. Now Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.</p><p>FINLEY: Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same avenues that Democrats did.</p><p>GIGOT: You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?</p><p>FINLEY: No. Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump automatically becomes a target. They're looking for any kind of target to hit. Tech companies happen to be convenient.</p><p>GIGOT: Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model? Free content next to advertising. Is that in threat at all?</p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR: I don't think the business model is so much in threat. I mean, that's kind of a larger subject. Are they a publisher? Should they pay people for their content.</p><p>GIGOT: Right.</p><p>HENNINGER: The problem here is political. We just listened to Dianne Feinstein address it. I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing about Facebook's technology.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it. No. Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation. They will probably make it worse. That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook doesn't have some vulnerabilities. They are not able to police the privacy of their users. It's like YouTube and jihadist videos. They, too, are unable to really police the videos. Unless the idea privacy is simply dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy. Look at the European Union. They're actively trying to fine Google and Facebook on this basis.</p><p>GIGOT: Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here. The government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy. The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch. So I think the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it. Is that something Facebook needs to worry about?</p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Look, here's the danger here. You now have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign. You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants, because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that they censor conservatives more. You have Facebook inviting people to come in and regulate it. Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would love that. They can then say, well, we're following the rules. We have a safe harbor.</p><p>But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you are in essence talking about regulating free speech. And this becomes then something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there, where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents are not allowed to speak as much as it is. And we know from Facebook's history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other. We don't want to go down that road. That requires Facebook stepping up to do something itself.</p><p>GIGOT: Paying for content, Allysia?</p><p>FINLEY: Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't want to be held responsible for the content. And that would obviously also crimp its profits.</p><p>Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the law which protects it from liability for user-generated content. I think there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable. It doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --</p><p>GIGOT: Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if they paid other people to do it for them. For example, the cable companies pay for cable content. Could they pay newspapers for content, as our proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?</p><p>FINLEY: Maybe so. Why should they do that when they get it for free? They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the actual quality news when users start demanding it. Right now, they're saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently don't want quality news.</p><p>We hope that's not true.</p><p>GIGOT: We hope that's not true. Yes. We hope they will pay for quality.</p><p>Thank you, Allysia.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House calls a fireable offense.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had a call with President Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory. We had a very good call. And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and Syria and North Korea and various other things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT: President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president congratulated Putin for his victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors reportedly instructing him not to do so. Trump defended the call Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. In the past, Obama called him also. The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong. Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing, not a bad thing. They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"</p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.</p><p>Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?</p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: No. Absolutely not. By the way, when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the people of Russia. Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Since when is Obama a role model?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KISSEL: Exactly. Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election. Putin invalidated his opponent. The only credible opponent he had. He controls the media outlets. The election was rigged. There was ballot box stuffing. Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.</p><p>But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say. There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British soil that had happened only a few days prior. That's a very serious incident. So I think the president mishandled this one.</p><p>GIGOT: Bill?</p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: I probably have an unpopular view. I think there was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook. People are angry because Trump did it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>President Obama did do it. I went back and I looked, very little condemnation. Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation. Not only that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about, \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.</p><p>GIGOT: Criticized him.</p><p>MCGURN: But very few others did.</p><p>So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it. I think the defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify. But I think it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little. I'm heartened that John Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the elections an act of war.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: In our election in 2016.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes.</p><p>GIGOT: Mary?</p><p>KISSSEL: It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or what he didn't say about Britain. It was also the assertion that Russia can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race. On what planet? There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful. In fact, what Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to be the problem that I created. So I think Trump has some idea about Putin that's not grounded in reality.</p><p>MCGURN: Very similar to the reset idea. That's what I'm saying.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT: Obama's reset.</p><p>MCGURN: Obama's reset. I'm more interested in the policy. There's a lot more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin. As I say, I'm heartened by John Bolton. I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his eyes about Russia and so forth. But I'm more interested in what the policy direction will be.</p><p>GIGOT: Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's. There's lethal weapons sales to Ukraine. The statement last week from the White House joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.</p><p>But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?</p><p>HENNINGER: And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story. That may drive people crazy to hear that. But when they see the president, going back 15 or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something there. And I think that will just hang out there until the president either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.</p><p>GIGOT: Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it would have come out by now. Let's assume there's nothing there that they have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants him to.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. That's entirely possible, Paul. He got criticized as well for congratulating Xi Jinping. Similar situation.</p><p>GIGOT: Thank you all.</p><p>We have to take one more break. When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>GIGOT: Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?</p><p>MCGURN: A hit for Cynthia Nixon. The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>GIGOT: In New York.</p><p>MCGURN: In New York. And now she's done something very un-Hollywood. She came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a $420 million subsidy in New York. Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it, she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she didn't think it was worth it. If this is progressivism, we need more of it.</p><p>GIGOT: Allysia?</p><p>FINLEY: This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling against high taxation over regulation. Only about 1 percent of California pot growers are licensed. They blame the state's heavy handed regulation, land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.</p><p>GIGOT: And tax rate of what?</p><p>FINLEY: Forty to 60 percent.</p><p>GIGOT: Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER: Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their common sense on gun control. There's no more volatile issue than gun control. But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools. About 75 percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of Republicans want more gun registration. Paul, it looks like there's a solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front of their faces.</p><p>GIGOT: All right.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC.</p><p>That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018032401cb267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYJ-1HF1-JB20-G4XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 24, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Bolton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>H.R.

I'm Paul  Gigot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House shakeup continued this week with President Trump announcing  late Thursday that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace H.R.  McMaster as national security advisor.  This comes on the heels of  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ouster last week and as the White House  faces key decisions on Iran and North Korea.  Does it signal a shift in the  administration's foreign policy?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger,  editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist, Bill McGurn.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dan, I want to read some words that I read describing John Bolton,  \"hawkish, super hawk, fire brand, undiplomatic, blunt, confrontational.\"   Those are the nice ones, the mild assertions, adjectives.  Is that fair?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  No, it's not fair.  What I'd  point out is this is not a position that has to be confirmed because  probably that wouldn't happen.  </p><p>I think we can sum this all up in two words, Paul, and that is status quo.   John Bolton has no patience whatsoever for the status quo.  Let me say also  that he served in two presidential administrations.  He served with Jim  Baker in the first Bush presidency.  He was undersecretary of state in the  second Bush presidency.  John Bolton has a lot of experience with  bureaucracies.  And whether the issue is Iran or what we should do about  North Korea, the status quo will always be careful.  And John Bolton's  career has been built around the idea not so much of not being careful but  pushing the status quo forward to deal with realities, such as the one  facing us with North Korea and the nuclear capability.  There won't be  buttons pushed here.  We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a  national security advisor that will push the rest of the policy making  community to come up with solutions reflecting the reality in front of our  faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, it's suggested that, somehow, he is dogmatic, can't get along  with people.  If you look at his diplomatic record, he was also ambassador  to the United Nations.  He got a lot of sanctions on North Korea through  the United Nations.  He developed something in the second Bush  administration in 2003 called the Proliferation Security Initiative, which  got the world together to be able to police arms movements and WMD  movements.  In the first H.W. administration he worked a peace deal on the  western Sahara, which was a real trouble spot that you don't hear about  anymore.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  He got U.N. resolutions that equated  Zionism with racism repealed that the United Nations, which has never been  accomplished before.</p><p>Look I think the bottom line on Bolton is he's a realist and he's been  correct throughout the years about the threats to America and he sees them  early.  He was correct that Pyongyang was not going to give up its nuclear  program with the Six Party talks.  He went against Condoleezza Rice, then  secretary of state.  </p><p>GIGOT:  He was vindicated.  </p><p>KISSEL:  He was absolutely vindicated.  He has been writing for years about  the danger of the essential nature of the Iran regime, why we can't let  them have nuclear weapons.  He predicted that the U.N. process that  President Obama started on Syria was, quote, \"doomed to failure.\"  So this  is a clear-eyed guy with a lot of experience who is unafraid to tell the  truth about the threats to the United States.  I think it's a great pick.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But when a lot of people hearing all that and knowing all that and  knowing in addition to that that he's actually pretty effective as a  bureaucratic insider, as Dan suggested.  They go, oh, my god, we're headed  for war, we're headed for war with Iran and we're headed for war with North  Korea.  Are we?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I don't think so.  I think he's clear-eyed about  the experience.  It's interesting, a year ago he didn't make it into the  administration.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>MCGURN:  It tells you something that he's in now.  And I suspect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Why do you think that is?  People say it's the mustache.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's so fixated on looks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not a joke.  </p><p>MCGURN:   I think a lot of it is, look, President Trump campaigned, he knew  Obama was weak overseas.  But he also campaigned against Bush-style wars.   And he probably associated John Bolton with that camp.  So it says a lot.   It also says a lot, look -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  It says a lot that he is replacing -- going to Bolton?  </p><p>MCGURN:  That he's going to Bolton for his national security advisor.  The  national security advisor is in the White House, so it's a very intimate  position.  You have to get along.  And I don't know all the policy  differences that General McMaster had with the president, but it sounds  like, on a lot of personality issues, he rubbed the president the wrong  way, and even there's reports General Mattis and so forth.  So clearly  there's a comfort level here.  And it's interesting that President Trump  would pick Mike Pompeo, who is the one that warned us about North Korea,  said within months they'll have this capacity to strike us with a nuclear  weapon, and John Bolton, who has more hawkish views on this as well.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes. </p><p>Dan, what do you think about the implications of this for policy?  One of  the implications I would suggest is that John Bolton is going to say, as he  has written for us many times, Mr. President I think you should pull out of  completely of the Iran agreement, for example.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  That is up for renewal in May.  I think the expectation  is the president will not renew the Iran nuclear deal in May.  And as Bill  was suggesting, Mike Pompeo was a primary congressional critic of that deal  when he was in the House of Representatives.  And I think you can probably  see Pompeo and John Bolton now performing something of an alliance to be  more forward-leaning with their foreign policy in Iran, North Korea, and I  would say Syria, as Mary was suggesting earlier.  It's not going to be a  stand-pat foreign policy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, briefly, any change on North Korea?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Look, if you don't want a war with North Korea, then the North  Koreans have to believe that President Trump is willing to strike them by  naming strong people like Pompeo at State and now Bolton at the national  security advisor position.  I think you have more of a deterrent there or  Pyongyang to try something.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I should add, we should add that H.R. McMaster served the president  very well as national security advisor.  They didn't mesh on a personal  level.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>GIGOT:  That's not McMaster's fault.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>GIGOT:  I think that gets more to the president.  </p><p>When we come back, another shake-up in Trump world this week, this time, on  his legal team.  What the changes say about the president's stance on the  Mueller probe, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Another Trump shake-up this week, this time, on the president's  legal team as the frenzy surrounding the Mueller probe reached a higher  pitch in Washington.  John Dowd, the president's lead lawyer in the Russia  investigation, resigned this week, just days after Trump hired veteran  Washington attorney, Joe DiGenova.  The president told reporters at the  White House Thursday that he would like to testify before Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, something Dowd had argued against.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, and \"Wall Street Journal\"  columnist, Kim Strassel.</p><p>Kim, how do you read the Dowd resignation?  Was it fundamentally about the  strategy difference?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  I think there's a strategy difference.   I think there was also just a frustration on Mr. Dowd's part.  He was  frustrated that he didn't have more control over the president.  He had  asked the president, his entire legal team has asked him not to go out  there and be texting and complaining about the Mueller probe in public.   Obviously, the president has been ignoring that advice.  </p><p>Look, I think there's an opportunity here, Paul, in that a lot of people  have wondered if this existing legal team is the right one in terms of what  we're hearing might come out of the Mueller probe.  For instance, an  obstruction charge.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  You might want some lawyers around you that are much more  prepared to deal with the constitutional questions of something like that  and have a strategy that's designed to counter, and it wasn't clear that  this legal team was doing that.  So this could be a moment for a shake-up  that better positions the president.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill, the Dowd concern was that if he put the president in with  Mueller, let's face it, the president, you never know what he's going to  say, and you never know what he's going to remember.  He may say something  that he believes it true and it's entirely false.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  Lawyers love that stuff, right?  I'm not a lawyer but every  lawyer I know would tell you not to do that --</p><p>GIGOT:  To do that, right.</p><p>MCGURN:  -- because you open yourself up.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But the president doesn't believe that.  He believes, hey, I can  handle anything.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  What do you think?  Do you think Dowd was right?  </p><p>MCGURN:  I think you have to look at two parts with Donald Trump.  One, I  think he has legitimate concerns that he feels he didn't do anything, he  didn't do anything wrong.  There are people trying to overturn an election  or make his administration so that it looks illegitimate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  I can see all that.  </p><p>MCGURN:  But I think it's important to see that because it's a big thing to  work against a presidency this way.  How he handles it another matter, you  know, the tweets.  And the lawyers don't seem to have much control over  him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's the point.  Trump can believe all that and come in there  with absolute certainty.</p><p>But, ultimately, what he says, Dan, can be something that trips him up.  We  have personal friends who still believe that they told the truth and they  ended up getting indicted for making false statements.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, one good example of someone who did not get indicted but  went through the process is Ted Olson --</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  -- the Supreme Court solicitor, former Justice Department  official who, when he was in the Reagan government, was investigated by an  independent counsel, became a very famous Supreme Court case.  It was a  nightmare for Ted Olson.  And the Trump team has reached out to Mr. Olson  to see whether he would join them.  He declined.  But nonetheless, there's  an awareness that dealing with a special counsel like Robert Mueller is a  dangerous enterprise.  </p><p>On the other side, there is Donald Trump who thinks he has been wronged and  he doesn't want those kinds of lawyers selling him out, so-to-speak.  I  think he's brought in someone like Joe DiGenova to be the guy who is going  to be kind of the bad cop, someone who is going lean on the system and make  sure Trump's personal interests are represented and that the lawyers  dealing with Mr. Mueller don't make a deal that puts the president in  jeopardy.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, let's turn to some other news this week on the Mueller probe  and the Russia issue.  The House Intelligence Committee, Republicans,  majority, released their report, initial report on what they discovered.   What did we learn?  What are the highlights?  </p><p>STRASSEL:  This matters, first and foremost, Paul, because it's the first  of any congressional committees to actually finish up a probe on this.   They put out both findings and recommendations.  And I think the top line  answer is here they did not find any evidence of any collusion between the  Trump White House and Russians in any way.  That's the important thing.   They did identify a number of holes in our system that the Russians have  been able to exploit.  And I think this is important because we want to be  looking forward here, not just back.  And that is very much what the  oversight -- I mean, the Intelligence Committee has been trying to do.   What's extraordinary is the depth and the breadth of the number of people  they interviewed and went through.  This was a very thorough investigation  in the end.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right, Bill, and in another move, momentum is building for  something I know you don't support, which is the naming of a second special  counsel, this time, to investigate how the FBI and justice handled Hillary  Clinton's e-mail investigation, among other things.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.  Look, the idea is that DOJ and FBI are resisting all these  efforts to investigate themselves.  Again, remember, under Donald Trump,  Rod Rosenstein at Justice and Christopher Wray at the FBI tried to make an  end-run around the Intel Commit at this and at this and they only coughed  up with documents because they were threatened with contempt.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  But do we need special counsel?</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think we need -- the problem with special counsel, if it's  really special, it's unconstitutional.  Right?  And if it's not special,  what's the difference?  I think what we need is for Congress and the  president to exert the levers that they have.  For example, there's  impeachment.  If the FBI director doesn't cough up the documents and is  really resisting, they could use that.  There's a lot of legislative tools  that they have.  </p><p>President Trump baffles me by not assigning someone at Justice to do as we  recommended to disburse information since it mostly vindicates him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  I think the political momentum is building for the special counsel.   We'll see what the inspector general report --</p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- we're all waiting for says.  If it says something that there was  bad behavior, I think we'll get a second special counsel, notwithstanding  advice.  I agree with you, your advice.  </p><p>President Trump following through on a campaign promise and hitting China  with tough tariffs.  How the markets and Beijing reacted to Thursday's  announcement, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Doing things for this  country that should have been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States.  And we don't  want that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  It's probably  one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump making good on a central campaign promise Thursday  and slapping tariffs on nearly $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move  meant to punish Beijing for what White House officials say is a pattern of  economic aggression that has robbed U.S. companies of millions of jobs and  billions of dollars in profit.  The Dow plunging more than 700 points in  the wake of Thursday's announcement as fears of a trade war increase.  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member, Mary Kissel.  </p><p>Mary, what do you make of the announcement?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I think it's a very dangerous game, Paul, because you never know,  when you start a trade war, where it's going to end.  And the China have  already said they would also impose tariffs as well on states that, by the  way, are important to Trump's base, most notably agriculture.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You worked in Hong Kong, as Bill did and as I did, and you know  from covering China that they discriminate against foreign firms.  Is there  a point, unlike maybe with steel tariffs, that Trump is actually seriously  addressing, a real problem with China?  </p><p>KISSEL:  In other words, does China commit, quote, unquote, \"economic  aggression?\"  </p><p>GIGOT:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Trump says yes.  Yes.  The answer is yes, they absolutely do.</p><p>GIGOT:  OK.  All right.</p><p>KISSEL:  They steal intellectual property.  They have state champions that  get subsidized loans from state-owned banks.  Yes, Trump has a point.  The  problem is, as we've pointed out in numerous editorials, is that you want  to put in place a system that doesn't harm American businesses and American  consumers.  And to be frank, that's a difficult challenge.  How do you  punish a country that's such a large part of global trade without also  punishing American consumers at the same time?  </p><p>GIGOT:  Well, Dan, Mary raises a good question, how do you do that?  There  is no question in my mind that China has been guilty of bad behavior.  I've  talked to many business executives who operate over there, and their point,  they said we go over there with enormous optimism and for a while things  were opening up.  The last few years, it's gotten really tough and they're  coerced to turn over trade secrets, intellectual property.  And the  regulatory system is rigged to get them to do that.  How do you address  that if not with tariffs?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  You start with the understanding that doing anything is an  enormous undertaking.  The entire developed world is deeply invested in  China.  It's difficult to extract themselves from those commitments.  </p><p>That said, you're going to need a strategy.  And a strategy is not what it  looks to be on offer from the Trump administration.  To take on China in  any sort of targeted way is going to require the support of our allies,  Western European nations, the other nations that trade with Europe.  But  you roll the tape back about 10 days and the president was threatening to  impose tariffs on the European Union.  Now it may look like they're being  exempted at the moment, but what are they supposed to think about the  United States' trade strategy.  One day it's on, another day it's off, and  now it's targeted at China.  So I think the president at this point is  really heading for an uphill battle in trying to do negotiation with China  because I suspect he won't have that much support from, say, Australia,  South Korea, japan or the European Union.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>What do you make, Bill, of the market response, down in a big way?  And if  you look at what the market's done since the tariffs began on steel, since  the trade initiative started, the momentum from tax reform has really  ended.</p><p>MCGURN:  I don't think the president sees this, but I think this is a break  with his pro-growth tax reform policy.  As we were saying, China does  cheat.  We've seen it.  But it's very hard to hit them without hitting  yourself.  It reminds me of someone shooting a gun in a small constricted  place and it ricochets off the walls.  I think China exports $1 billion  worth of steel to us, but we export $13 billion of soybeans to them.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Right.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Who's going to -- I fire at you, China, and then you the farmer  gets hit.  It's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  But is there a real economic risk here?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Uncertainty is what markets fear most, right, and trade wars are  among the most uncertain.  I'm a hawk in everything except for trade wars.   And it just -- it's the definition of uncertainty.  You do your thing and  you expect them to do one thing, but they could branch out into completely  different areas.  </p><p>KISSEL:  I do have to maybe play devil's advocate a little bit.  No one  forced the companies to go over and do business with China.  A lot of the  CEOs, I know many of the financial institutions CEOs, were cheerleaders for  China's authoritarian regime.  They thought they had great connections and  they'd get a different kind of bargain.  Then they woke up 10 years later  and realized their intellectual property was stolen.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But if you're a CEO, how do you ignore the Chinese market?  </p><p>KISSEL:  There are several large Fortune 500 companies that haven't gone in  there, Paul.  I have sympathy for them.  They had their intellectual  property stolen.  But I also don't want to let them off the hook.  </p><p>GIGOT:  The other thing --</p><p>KISSEL:  They should have gone --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  You had an arc of reform in China.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Right.</p><p>GIGOT:  And with Xi Jinping and his predecessor, it stopped.  It's gone  backwards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  So, I mean -- </p><p>MCGURN:  It's also the phony argument on trade deficits.  People that don't  understand how these numbers are put together -- our former boss, Bob  Bartley, said the way to fix the deficit problem is to stop keeping  statistics.  Just take Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.  What Hong Kong and  Taiwan did was export their deficits to China.  The way they value  something is the last person that puts something into an iPhone, they get  the full cost of it.  So the bulk of the value can be from somewhere else,  but China gets stuck --  </p><p>GIGOT:  That's literally true in the case of the iPhone.  All China does is  assemble it and it's counted as total value as part --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Part of the deficit.  </p><p>When we come back, Facebook under fire.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promises  changes after data from more than 50 million users was harvested by a data  analytics firm with ties to the Trump campaign.  Is big tech getting  different treatment than it did in the Obama years?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST:  Facebook under fire this week after revelations that  more than 50 million user profiles were harvested by a data analysis firm  employed by President Trump's 2016 campaign.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his  silence on the growing furor Wednesday apologizing for the breach and  promising to do better.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust, and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We have a basic responsibility to protect  people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the  opportunity to serve people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler was a co-founder and president of Velocity Capital  Management, an investment firm based in Palo Alto.  He also writes the  \"Inside View\" column for the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  </p><p>Good to see you, Andy.  How are you?  </p><p>ANDY KESSLER, INSIDE VIEW COLUMNIST:  I'm doing great, thanks.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Taking a look at this news about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,  is this a real scandal or kind of overdone?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, first, I have good news, which is Cher deleted her Facebook  account, which means democracy is safe again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>My sense is this is a big P.R. problem for Facebook, but the reality of it  is, it's not going to affect their business.  I mean, by now, if you use  Facebook, you know your data's not safe.  You know you're inundated with  fake news.  Yet, people still use it.  And their engagement numbers have  rolled over a little bit.  It's mostly the younger generation moving to  Instagram, which Facebook owns.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Facebook owns, yes.</p><p>KESSLER:  So big P.R. problem, not so much an operations problem.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Wait a minute.  This is not a big deal then?  So why are people  paying so much attention to it?  We knew, for example, the 2012 campaign,  the Obama campaign used Facebook data, and when that was discovered they  were hailed as geniuses for --</p><p>KESSLER:  That's right.</p><p>GIGOT:  -- for using that data to help their campaign.  This time, Trump  campaign-related group used it, and did it make a difference?  We don't  know.  So is this just politics?  </p><p>KESSLER:  The hypocrisy is piled high.  In June of 2013, \"The Sunday Times\"  ran a piece called \"Obama's Masterminds Catch In.\"  They basically admitted  they stole the social graph, which is the connections between the users  from Facebook, blowing all of the terms of use of Facebook.  And Facebook  let them.  The quote from the article was, \"You can do this, as long as you  stop doing it on November 7th.\"  So there was no backlash then.  But now  there's a huge -- people are calling it the tech-lash, as big tech is  blamed for everything.  It's inequality problems, diversity problems and  now swinging elections.  We're in a lot different environment for these  companies as they become these big, massive multi-hundred-billion-dollar  valued enterprises.  </p><p>GIGOT:  On that point, Facebook has had a really dream ride, right, up 500  -- more than $500 billion, $500 billion in market capitalization.  A big  chunk of that, 10 percent, 12 percent off this week.  So clearly the market  is fearing that there might be some threat to the business model, if not,  because users will abandon it, because the regulators will decide to come  in and start to impose controls.  How big a fear is that?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out on CNN and other places saying he  wanted to be regulated.  Sheryl Sandburg said they would welcome  regulation.  I think they have to be careful what they wish.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think Facebook has big problems down the road in that they now have 2.3  billion users and they're running out of them.  They're shut out of China.   They can't go into Russia because there's competition, can't grow much more  in Russia because of the competition.  And so at some point, Wall Street  will get annoyed with their growth rate as that rolls over, as new users  are hard to come by.  But right now, I look at this as an opportunity for  Facebook.  Think about it.  Here's these companies that have been stealing  the social graph, all the data about all these inner connections.  Facebook  should look at that as a profit possibility.  Look at what TV networks make  on campaigns.  Every four years, it's a huge growth in revenues for TV  campaigns.  Facebook should say this is our business, stop stealing our  data, we're going to leverage it ourselves.  Near term, I look at it as a  positive, as a new business opportunity.  </p><p>GIGOT:  But their model has been we'll get content for free, they'll get  content, they'll get Andy Kessler's column because the \"Wall Street  Journal\" runs it and then they'll get advertising against it.  And they  don't pay Andy Kessler.  They don't pay the \"Wall Street Journal.\"  Is that  basic advertising model, free content, and putting advertising against it,  is that going to be in jeopardy because of -- this is a little different  than the privacy element, but this gets into the fake news problem, where  people are putting -- they're putting content and advertisers next to  really bad actors.  </p><p>KESSLER:  I think that's a huge issue for Facebook.  And I think they've  made noise about taking steps to identify which content is real or more  trustworthy than those that aren't.  And when he talked about regulation,  he had talked about -- Zuckerberg talked about regulation, he talked about  transparency in advertising.  Well, I'd like to see a little more  transparency in the content that they run, that people link to.  Is this a  trustworthy site?  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is going to be a lot more  trustworthy than the Onion or something like that.  Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Or \"Russia Today.\"   \"Or Russia Today.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KESSLER:  -- the steps they take over the next year or so.</p><p>GIGOT:  But they're going to have to act to do something to stop this furor  because the market is really -- is skeptical.  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, the market -- that's the fun part about the stock market.   It shoots first and asks questions later.  As long as their growth  continues to tick up, I think the stock is going to continue to do fine.   Again, I worry long-term.  But Facebook has been resilient.  They changed  their news feed a bunch of years ago, a bunch of users were up in arms, I'm  going to quit, and yet the numbers went up and up.  It's a very addicting  platform and they seem to be able to do the right thing.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Andy Kessler, thanks for being here.  </p><p>Still ahead, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  breach, can government regulation of social media be far behind?  We'll ask  our panel, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  If the industry won't solve these  kinds of problems themselves, we'll have to solve them with legislation.   And I don't think that's the most desirable course of action, but you can't  have 50 million people lose the privacy of their data this way.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  Well, as calls grow on Capitol Hill for hearings on the Facebook  data breach, can legislation regulating the social media giant be far  behind?  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial board member and devoted Facebook user - well, maybe not so much  --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- Allysia Finley.  </p><p>You heard Andy Kessler and Dianne Feinstein.  Is the Cambridge Analytica  uproar overblown?  </p><p>ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  It's definitely overblown.  We  don't even know if Cambridge Analytica used this data for the Trump  campaign.  The Trump campaign last year said that it used the Republican  National Committee's database because the data from Cambridge Analytica  wasn't very good.  Cambridge Analytica has also said that it deleted any  data that was improperly accessed.  </p><p>GIGOT:  So why, then, the uproar now?  For years, we know Democrats in  Congress and the Obama administration provided a lot of political  protection for Facebook, for Google, for the big tech companies.  Now  Democrats are saying, look, we're going to look at you.  </p><p>FINLEY:  Because they're discovering that Republicans can exploit the same  avenues that Democrats did.  </p><p>GIGOT:  You really don't think that Donald Trump won because of Facebook?  </p><p>FINLEY:  No.  Anything that can be social associated with Donald Trump  automatically becomes a target.  They're looking for any kind of target to  hit.  Tech companies happen to be convenient.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, what about the risks to Facebook's business model?  Free  content next to advertising.  Is that in threat at all?  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  I don't think the business model  is so much in threat.  I mean, that's kind of a larger subject.  Are they a  publisher?  Should they pay people for their content.</p><p>GIGOT:  Right.</p><p>HENNINGER:  The problem here is political.  We just listened to Dianne  Feinstein address it.  I expect Senator Feinstein knows pretty much nothing  about Facebook's technology.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But she says, if they don't solve the problem, we'll solve them for it.   No.  Washington, Congress will not solve the problem through regulation.   They will probably make it worse.  That doesn't mean, though, that Facebook  doesn't have some vulnerabilities.  They are not able to police the privacy  of their users.  It's like YouTube and jihadist videos.  They, too, are  unable to really police the videos.  Unless the idea privacy is simply  dead, and people say we don't care what companies like Facebook do, there  will always be pressure to try to do something to protect people's privacy.   Look at the European Union.  They're actively trying to fine Google and  Facebook on this basis.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Kim, I think this is one of the vulnerabilities here.  The  government will go after Facebook and Google I think very hard on privacy.   The E.U.., the European Union, is leading the way on this and we know kind  of when they get in, they do it not with a light touch.  So I think the  FTC, Federal Trade Commission, is looking at it.  Is that something  Facebook needs to worry about?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Look, here's the danger here.  You now  have Democrats furious at Facebook because it helps the Trump campaign.   You have Republicans who have always been skeptical of these tech giants,  because they've long believed they're biased against conservatives, that  they censor conservatives more.  You have Facebook inviting people to come  in and regulate it.  Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, because they would  love that.  They can then say, well, we're following the rules.  We have a  safe harbor.  </p><p>But whenever you're talking about regulating an organization like this, you  are in essence talking about regulating free speech.  And this becomes then  something akin to the campaign finance regulations that you have out there,  where the party in power has an interest in making sure that its opponents  are not allowed to speak as much as it is.  And we know from Facebook's  history that it has a predilection for Democrats, so the way it interprets  the regulations could be biased against one political party or the other.   We don't want to go down that road.  That requires Facebook stepping up to  do something itself.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Paying for content, Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Well, I think it's going to try to resist that because it doesn't  want to be held responsible for the content.  And that would obviously also  crimp its profits.  </p><p>Look, right now, they've enjoyed legal protection under Section 230 of the  law which protects it from liability for user-generated content.  I think  there's a concern, if it had to pay for content, maybe Congress would  reinterpret Section 230, or courts could, in order to hold it liable.  It  doesn't want to be in the position of curating content or actually --  </p><p>GIGOT:  Why couldn't they -- they wouldn't necessarily have to do that if  they paid other people to do it for them.  For example, the cable companies  pay for cable content.  Could they pay newspapers for content, as our  proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, has suggested?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Maybe so.  Why should they do that when they get it for free?   They may have to eventually try to sift through the fake news and the  actual quality news when users start demanding it.  Right now, they're  saying basically we're giving users what they want, and users apparently  don't want quality news.  </p><p>We hope that's not true.  </p><p>GIGOT:  We hope that's not true.  Yes.  We hope they will pay for quality.  </p><p>Thank you, Allysia.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump defending his decision to congratulate Russian  President Vladimir Putin on his reelection amid a leak that the White House  calls a fireable offense.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a call with President  Putin and congratulated him on the victory, his electoral victory.  We had  a very good call.  And I suspect that we'll probably be meeting in the not- too-distant future to discuss the arms race and also to discuss Ukraine and  Syria and North Korea and various other things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIGOT:  President Trump facing blow-back for his call this week to Russian  President Vladimir Putin.  The president congratulated Putin for his  victory in last Sunday's election, despite his national security advisors  reportedly instructing him not to do so.  Trump defended the call  Wednesday, tweeting, quote, \"I called President Putin of Russia to  congratulate him on his election victory.  In the past, Obama called him  also.  The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate  him.  They are wrong.  Getting along with Russia and others is a good  thing, not a bad thing.  They can help solve problems with North Korea,  Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.\"  </p><p>We're back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.  </p><p>Mary, was he right to congratulate Putin?  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER:  No.  Absolutely not.  By the way,  when Obama called, he didn't congratulate Putin, he congratulated the  people of Russia.  Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Since when is Obama a role model?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KISSEL:  Exactly.  Look, first of all, it was absolutely a rigged election.   Putin invalidated his opponent.  The only credible opponent he had.  He  controls the media outlets.  The election was rigged.  There was ballot box  stuffing.  Look, this is nothing to congratulate him on.  </p><p>But, Paul, it wasn't just what Trump said, it was what he didn't say.   There was no question at all about the chemical weapons attack on British  soil that had happened only a few days prior.  That's a very serious  incident.  So I think the president mishandled this one.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Bill?  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  I probably have an unpopular view.  I think there  was a lot -- it's a lot like Facebook.  People are angry because Trump did  it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>President Obama did do it.  I went back and I looked, very little  condemnation.  Charles Krauthammer wrote a strong condemnation.  Not only  that, 12 days after Obama had called Putin, he issued his statement about,  \"I could be more flexible after the elections,\" and we criticized him.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Criticized him.</p><p>MCGURN:  But very few others did.  </p><p>So look, I think the problem -- I wouldn't have done it.  I think the  defense of it is harder than the actual doing it to justify.  But I think  it's a lot -- it's a lot to do about very little.  I'm heartened that John  Bolton actually is on record as calling Putin's interference in the  elections an act of war.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  In our election in 2016.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary?  </p><p>KISSSEL:  It wasn't just about congratulating him on a sham election or  what he didn't say about Britain.  It was also the assertion that Russia  can work with us on things like Syria or the nuclear arms race.  On what  planet?  There's no evidence at all that Putin is helpful.  In fact, what  Putin does is he creates problems, like Syria, and then he goes to the  United States and says, I can help you solve your problem, just happens to  be the problem that I created.  So I think Trump has some idea about Putin  that's not grounded in reality.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Very similar to the reset idea.  That's what I'm saying.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Obama's reset.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Obama's reset.  I'm more interested in the policy.  There's a lot  more I would like to see President Trump do vis-a-vis Putin.  As I say, I'm  heartened by John Bolton.  I don't think John Bolton has any scales on his  eyes about Russia and so forth.  But I'm more interested in what the policy  direction will be.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Dan, when you look at the policy record on Russia in the first year  of the Trump administration, it's tougher than Obama's.  There's lethal  weapons sales to Ukraine.  The statement last week from the White House  joining the leaders of Europe in condemning the chemical attack in London.  </p><p>But there's this issue people raise, which is, why can't Donald Trump  himself seem to say a discouraging word about Vladimir Putin?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  And that is the big question, Paul, which I have said and  written several times is one of the reasons people continue to think that  there is something to the Trump, Russian collusion story.  That may drive  people crazy to hear that.  But when they see the president, going back 15  or 16 months, praising Vladimir Putin, having all of these Russian  aggressions take place, and then this very week, call him to congratulate  him, they default -- many people default to the belief there is something  there.  And I think that will just hang out there until the president  either explains why he keeps making these congratulatory calls to Putin or  shows some evidence that they're producing policy as a result.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Mary, assuming there is nothing there -- OK, you would think it  would have come out by now.  Let's assume there's nothing there that they  have over Trump, it's almost as if he won't say it because everybody wants  him to.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  That's entirely possible, Paul.  He got criticized as well  for congratulating Xi Jinping.  Similar situation.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Thank you all.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GIGOT:  Time now for our \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week -- Bill?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit for Cynthia Nixon.  The former \"Sex in the City\" star, this  week, announced she's running in the Democratic primary against Governor  Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>GIGOT:  In New York.</p><p>MCGURN:  In New York.  And now she's done something very un-Hollywood.  She  came out against the tax breaks for film and TV that work out to about a  $420 million subsidy in New York.  Asked by the \"Buffalo News\" about it,  she said these breaks mostly benefit large entertainment companies and she  didn't think it was worth it.  If this is progressivism, we need more of  it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Allysia?  </p><p>FINLEY:  This is a hit to California's pot industry that is rebelling  against high taxation over regulation.  Only about 1 percent of California  pot growers are licensed.  They blame the state's heavy handed regulation,  land use regulation, zoning restrictions, water conservation, you name it.  </p><p>GIGOT:  And tax rate of what?  </p><p>FINLEY:  Forty to 60 percent.  </p><p>GIGOT:  Now, suddenly, they're all Libertarians.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER:  Paul, I'm going to give a hit to the American people for their  common sense on gun control.  There's no more volatile issue than gun  control.  But an IPSO/Reuters poll just out shows that a majority of  Americans, including Republicans, Democrats, and gun owners, want more  restrictions on guns and they want armed guards in schools.  About 75  percent of adults say they want armed guards in schools, and 83 percent of  Republicans want more gun registration.  Paul, it looks like there's a  solution here if the Republicans and Democrats would just see it in front  of their faces.  </p><p>GIGOT:  All right.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.  </p><p>That's it for this week's show.  Thanks to my panel.  Thanks to you for  watching.  I'm Paul Gigot.  Hope to see you right here next week.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Grounded.  President Trump has announced that he's keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say the Ethiopian Airlines crash show similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation.  At the center of that probe, the social media giant's data deals with technology companies.  It comes after a major outage hits Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are lower this morning.  Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down 26 points on the Dow.  That's well off of the lows of the morning.  The S&amp;P is down two and the NASDAQ is now slipped into positive territory, it is up four points.  This after a wild day yesterday on Wall Street when all was set and done the major indices finished strong up 148 points on the Dow industrials yesterday, two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P was up 19, the NASDAQ was up 52.  Two-thirds of a percent there as well.  In Europe this morning, markets are higher across the board.  FT-100 up 48, CAC Quarante up 35, DAX Index up 21.  In Asia overnight, mixed performance.  Worst performer was China.  Shanghai Composite down 1-1/4 percent.</p><p>A deadly and historic blizzard bringing hurricane force winds to central U.S.  And those winds causing this tractor trailer to completely flip over in Texas.</p><p>Out on bond.  Actress Lori Loughlin posting a million after appearing in court for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal.</p><p>Plus, pay to play.  A new report says electronic arts paid top gamer ninja a million dollars to promote Apex legends.  All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst, Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.</p><p>FORBES:  Lot of news, especially on the college front.  This big overhang is still China.  Where we get that trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  We haven't heard when this meeting is between President Trump and Xi Jinping.  Now the President says they're pushing it off until April.</p><p>FORBES:  And you have to wonder, does this mean they're close to a deal but they're trying to get last-minute concessions and they're planning to seek --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or not close at all.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think you hit the nail on the head earlier, Steve.  It's all about enforcement, right?  What is he going to -- we talked about this on the show just a few weeks ago.  What is Xi going to say to Trump that he didn't already promise in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama?  How do we hold their feet to the fire?  How do we enforce these things?  That's what's crucial for me for this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the U.S. wants to be able to put tariffs back in place, should the Chinese not follow through on their promises.  The Chinese say well, then we want that as well.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  The Chinese are never going to agree to that.  But the key thing is not just the enforcement mechanism.  It's the ability or the willingness of the United States to enforce agreements.  We haven't done it consistently in the past.  That's why this Huawei thing is so important.  We are now going to do it in the future.  I think that weighs more than any mechanism.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And I will quickly point to a great, what they call in journalism, a tick-tock in the Wall Street Journal about this college cheating scandal.  And it all started with one guy, a financial executive who was being pursued on securities fraud charges and he told investigators, oh, I got something much bigger for you.  And he pointed to the Yale Soccer coach wore a wire, meeting with him in Boston, who asked the individual, this coach asked for a $450,000 payout to get a kid into Yale and there, the ball started rolling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was surveillance, phones being tapped of the mastermind, Rick Singer.  He was recording conversations.  He tried to tip off about half a dozen of the families that he was wearing a wire and that they ought to be careful but again, 33 parents charged so far.  Lori Loughlin out on -- a million dollars bail is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So he was trying to get his securities issues lessened.  He was under securities investigation and that's how he did it.  By saying look over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People with money can be very, very stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is grounding the entire Boeing 737 Max fleet after the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  Jeff flock is covering the story.  He's live at O'Hare International Airport this morning in Chicago.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  One-two punch to air travelers today.  Both the storm canceling flights as well as the grounding of those aircraft, the 737 Maxes.  Take a look at the board at O'Hare.  If you see yellow or red, that means your flight is either canceled or delayed.  The grounding of the 737s announced by the President yesterday.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.  All of those planes are grounded effective immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  Latest on the investigation, one, the black box now to France to be analyzed but as you reported earlier, Maria, similarities in the two crashes.  That leading the FAA to say we better shut it all down.  People being rebooked now but as we said, some of the flights canceled.  Now, as you reported also, a fairly small number of planes in the air that are 737 Maxes or at least were in the air.  Southwest, the biggest among them.</p><p>But if you look at the overall fleet, take a look at those numbers, the overall U.S. Air fleet is about 7,000 or more aircraft.  The number grounded, less than 70.  You can do the math on that.  It's less than one percent.  We have the latest number of delays and cancellations and I would say the Lion's share of these are as a result of the so-called bomb cyclone.  Don't like that term, but there you go.</p><p>490 delays and over 1,000 cancellations, the majority of those coming in Denver.  Number two on the list here in Chicago.  We're at least number two on the list.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Jeff, thanks very much.  We'll keep following that.  Jeff Flock in Chicago this morning.  I want to turn to the race for 2020 now.  Beto O'Rourke has thrown his hat in the ring officially for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D) TEXAS:  This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.  The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate have never been greater.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor, Karl Rove.  Karl, great to see you.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  How are you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm great.  Want to get to your op-ed on AOC in a second.  But first, your reaction to Beto announcing his bid.</p><p>ROVE:  Am I the only one who thinks it's ironic that he sort of makes his announcement in a long interview in a magazine with vanity in its title?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROVE:  Look, it was revealing -- it was a revealing interview, though.  He said you know what, I never prepare my speeches which is why he said he's a reckless guy as a result.  So that's what led him to say I don't think there's nothing more American than taking a knee, law enforcement is the Jim -- new Jim Crow-ism.  We heard him recently in El Paso say, yes, I'm in favor of tearing down all the fences and borders between us and Mexico.</p><p>It's why when he went out to campaign in Texas in 2017 and '18 and went to all 254 counties, he would go to these small towns and give a speech to the local group of Democrats and routinely drop the F-bomb.  And that was OK, I guess, for the hip parts of Dallas and Austin and Houston, but when you're out in Friona or Jacksonville or Cuero, those people are church-going people even if they're Democrats and by god, you don't use the F-bomb in front of polite people.  I mean, he's a little bit reckless.</p><p>FORBES:  So what's the attraction, Karl?  Other than he's a pretty boy and nearly beat Ted Cruz, who had his own popularity issues in Texas?  What's the fascination with this guy?  Should we take him seriously?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, -- Steve, glad you asked.  I've got a white board here.  Some -- for the interview as well.  For the interview as well.  You can't -- he said, you know, you can't hide from whom you are.  And he's right.  And he's got charisma and natural authenticity and a comfort level about being around people and being in the public arena and that will be helpful to him.  He talks in the article about how he is more enthused about talking about what he is for than what he is against.</p><p>And I think it's going to be an important element in the 2020 campaign for any Democrat.  He said I got to have a campaign that looks like America.  He realizes that he's a white guy so he's going to have a campaign and pledges an administration that looks like America.  So we're going to see a lot of -- a lot of women and we're going to see a lot of people of color in his campaign.  He says, I will work with republicans.  I did it when I was in Congress.</p><p>I will do it as President which is going to be unique.  Is Elizabeth Warren going to say, Bernie Sanders going to say, Kamala Harris going to say, oh, I'm going to work with Republicans?  And then remember, he raised $80 million for a Senate race.  The question is how many of those donors are going to stick with him.  But that's a big starting point that makes it -- makes it possible for him to be competitive.  The real question's going to be what's the message?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  And we've got a little bit of a sense of it.  It's like hope and optimism, we're a great country, we faced big challenges but we can overcome them.  We'll see how this goes.  The big challenge for him is going to be his Senate race where he got close to Ted Cruz is not going to be like the Presidential race because Ted Cruz ignored him.  He gave him 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 and virtually all of 2018 to go out there and be by himself projecting a message to the voters and only in late September and October did Cruz engage with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, really?  OK.</p><p>ROVE:  He's going to be engaged with right away by a bunch of Democrats.  We'll see how he handles it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Karl, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>ROVE:  Dagen?  Of course it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Here's Beto O'Rourke,\" the challenges we face are the greatest in living memory.  OK.  Not the Great Depression, not Pearl Harbor, not World War II, not the Cold War, not the Cuban Missile Crisis, not the 70s with the Sky High guest, not 9/11, not the 2008 financial crisis.  Down south we say don't spit in my face and tell me it's raining.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes, yes.  This is going to be a problem for all the Democrats of hyperventilating about how bad the country is but remember that helps them inside their party.  There are -- there are -- the core of the Democratic base does believe the biggest threat we have faced in our lifetimes is the presence of Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office.  This is I think Robert Francis O'Rourke's attempt to negotiate around this.</p><p>And look, please, let's not refer to him by the fake name -- nickname that he did not use at Woodbury Forest, that he did not use at Colombia, that he did not use as an adult when he was -- when he was in a grunge band but only started to reemphasize when he ran for the city council in a heavily Latino town, El Paso, Texas.  Let's please refer to him by the name that he appears on the ballot as Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Please.  Let's do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.  He went to Woodbury?  Well, that's an elitist private school in Orange, Virginia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's that about?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he was there -- he was there when it was not co-ed.  So -- and he went to Colombia.  As I remember, that's sort of a private elite institution on the upper west side of New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he just started using it when he ran for office.  That's interesting because I was just asking the panel about Beto and Robert Francis and why now we're calling him Beto.  I mean, he's Irish, right?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he's Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Yes.  And look, if you want a want a nickname, let's give him what his name represents RFOR.  Robert Francis O'Rourke.  RFOR.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Karl, before you go, you got to talk to us about your op-ed this morning in the Journal.  American history as told by AOC.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  I listened to her speech here in Austin at south by southwest and it is jaw-dropping.  Look, of course, we were going to have her and the moderator immediately say Donald J. Trump is a racist but Ronald Reagan is a racist and why, because he talked about a woman who bilked welfare in the 70s out of $150,000 and he called her -- he didn't call her welfare queen.  Others did.</p><p>But AOC says well, that was racist.  Well, the woman was white.  Please tell me what's racist about that.  And then FDR --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the new deal?  The new deal too.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  The new deal was racist because it expanded, it legit -- it literally gave mortgage relief to white people but not to black people and as a result, the housing gap, the wealth gap grew because of the racist policies of Franklin Roosevelt.  Well, first of all, it is not borne out by the facts.  The Home Owners' Loan Corporation did not expand the difference between home ownership between blacks and whites.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROVE:  And it's just jaw-dropping.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she said it does not -- it does not feel good to live in America today.  I mean, what in the world are these people living in?</p><p>ROVE:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The America is the highlight of the world.  I mean, particularly now, where you've got this economy that is -- that is firing on all cylinders.</p><p>FORBES:  You know, we're raising money here to give her a ticket to Venezuela.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, you know what, that private charity is wrong.  The government should pay for the ticket to Venezuela.  Please.  Private charity is bad.  It's -- that's merely an expression of the wealthy who have been stealing the money from -- what I loved was she was talking about ordinary people, ordinary working people and her audience had to pay between $1300 and $1600 for their tickets that allowed her to go -- that allowed them to go in. They had all access premium passes in order to go see AOC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they did and she had a packed house.  Karl, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Karl Rove.</p><p>ROVE:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great op-ed.  Coming up, trouble for Facebook.  The social media giant reportedly facing a criminal investigation now for handing over user data to major tech companies without permission.  The fallout, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, it's been something else.  Good morning again.  Nearly 3100 flights canceled over two days, most of them at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there.  Wind gusts as strong as 80 miles per hour.  Now, the Colorado police officer -- elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.</p><p>Now, let's go to Texas.  Small planes overturned in the municipal airport by high winds.  They looked like toys.  Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico, sweeping a train right off of the tracks.  And then there is some stunning video out of Texas.  Look at this.  Strong winds blowing over a tractor trailer.  And this wasn't the only one.  There's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over.  No word, folks, of the condition of this driver, if he's OK or not.  But wow, something else.</p><p>OK.  Shares of General Electric lower in the premarket.  They're forecasting adjusted earnings between 50 and 60 cents per share this year.  That is below analyst expectations of around 70 cents.  G.E. also says its industrial operations could burn about two billion more cash than they generated in 2018.  There is the stock, actually it's higher in the premarket, 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>And then there is this.  Next year's Major League Home Run Derby winner is going to reportedly get a nice little bonus, $1 million.  That is according to the new agreement between the MLB and the players association.  Other changes coming to the league include a single trade deadline and a three batter minimum for pitchers.  All that starts in 2020.  And those are your headlines, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Coming up, Facebook is under fire this morning.  The technology giant reportedly now under criminal investigation for the company sharing user data with more than 150 of the largest technology companies out there without permission.</p><p>Then game on.  E.A. games reportedly paying the world's most followed gamer $1 million to play and promote the launch of Apex legends.  The big business of gaming, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook is under fire once again.  The company reportedly facing a criminal investigation over controversial data sharing deals with technology giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft.  Now, Facebook reportedly gave access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its users to those tech companies.  This after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatApp across the globe yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is former prosecutor and criminal defense attorney at the Bianchi Law Group, David Bruno.  David, good to have you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, PARTNER, THE BIANCHI LAW GROUP:  Good morning.  And thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the Facebook news.</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes.  This is -- the information comes from the New York Times through unnamed sources so let's start there.  But if there's a grand jury investigation out of the district, it's criminal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  It's criminal.  This is unrelated to any of the administrative action, unrelated to the consent order, unrelated to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the implications of a criminal investigation for Facebook?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, the grand jury subpoenas mean nothing, right?  Because when we talk about criminal, you got to talk about presumption of innocence.  Even for somebody that's charged, there's a presumption of innocence.  And there's even more caution when it's just a grand jury subpoena.  So in the event that crimes have been violated, it could be the corporation generally, could be individual officers, could be board members.  You know, it's limitless when you talk about criminal law.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's not just this investigation.  This is in the Eastern district of New York.  There's also a securities fraud investigation going on within the Justice Department in the Northern District of California related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  There's the FTC looking into its behavior, did it basically violate a consent agreement that it signed in 2011 over again, shared data that deceived customers and consumers.</p><p>And then also, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into their behavior.  And what's going on is they keep saying that they're fixing problems, we're not doing this, and it turns up time and time again that they're not being quite frankly honest with the American people and regulators.</p><p>BRUNO:  Great point.  Especially on the consent order.  Because they had problems releasing consumer data before the consent order in 2011.  That's why there's a consent order.  And they agreed not to release without the consent of the consumers.  So the Cambridge Analytica issue is a potential violation and they're still looking at that.  Like you said, that's the California stuff.  But it's interesting because New York is different.  I think the New York investigation is completely different than Cambridge Analytica, which could sign -- be a sign for problems for safety.</p><p>FORBES:  So what exactly in New York is the crime they think?</p><p>BRUNO:  Even Times article itself says we don't know.  We don't know how long it's been open and we don't know what the scope is.  All they know is that these two unnamed cell phone companies received grand jury subpoenas.  That's going to be subpoena duces tecum for records.  So they're probably looking at the agreement between Facebook and the cell phone companies as well as any data that was received in exchange between the two.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  This is totally separate from Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the big tech companies but it certainly adds, you know, more political pressure and more weight to her proposal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll break up?  They will be forced to break up?</p><p>BRUNO:  I was talking about this in the morning show a couple days ago.  I think ultimately, yes.  But right now, no.  It would be under the antitrust laws.  They could -- they could proceed under those laws or through new laws by Congress.  That would potentially be something that could affect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congress will start by putting up roadblocks to additional acquisitions by these companies.  Again, buying up the smaller companies and essentially buying them up and then shutting them down just to own and sit on top of technology that might be valuable and increase their market share.  That would be the first step.  It won't be breaking a lot.</p><p>BRUNO:  When is Congress going to act?  This was in the forefront last year when we were talking about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, they got --</p><p>BREAM:  This is a completely different --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got many of the CEOs to come down and testify --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes, exactly.  Zuckerberg himself testified last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  David Bruno there.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Tesla is gearing up for a big reveal.  The company will unveil its Model Y SUV later today.  We will tell you what to expect when we come back.</p><p>And then the college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin posted a million dollars in bond after appearing in Federal court yesterday while her daughter was reportedly onboard the yacht of the chairman of the USC's board of trustees.  When the scandal actually broke, the outrage coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now, 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news, we're getting readings on initial Jobless Claims and Import/Export Prices.  You'll see it on the screen momentarily.  Futures, meanwhile, off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now showing a decline of just 10 points.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged, exactly where it closed yesterday.  And the NASDAQ is up six points currently.  In Europe this morning, gains across the board, pretty much all morning this morning.  European indices look like this.  Jobless Claims coming out, 229,000 as you can see.  And the Ft-100 is up 41 points.  The CAC Quarante is up 35 points.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 39.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Shanghai was the worst performer, down 1-1/4 percent.  Pushing back on the Green New Deal, top Republicans are calling for a hearing on the controversial Green Deal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Onto the latest on the college cheating scandal, one of the parents who was arrested, his son coming to his defense while casually smoking marijuana on the streets of New York City.  Wait until you see this.  Then pay to play, a new report says Electronic Arts paid top gamer, Ninja, $1 million to promote Apex Legends, all those stories coming up.  But first, new economic data out this morning.  We've got the Initial Jobless claims number.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at a market that is pretty much back and forth, positive and negative territory all morning.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  That's right, Maria.  We've been looking at these numbers.  I was just talking with a trader, that's why my attention was not on you.  Initial Jobless Claims, this is actually higher than anticipated.  So, you know, I got to tell you, we had such great news on the jobs market so far.  I'm not sure traders are going to pay a whole lot of attention to this.  As you know, it's a very volatile number week to week, the four-week moving average, 226,250.  We come in at 229,000.  It's a little higher, but not anything that's likely to move the markets here.  Import/export prices, this is a turnaround and interesting, because what we've had are import and export prices that have been declining.  Now, a turnaround, higher and higher than anticipated.  The question here, is the government actually dealing with the real numbers now after the shutdown?  They're still trying to get it together, I think.  And there could be noise in these numbers.</p><p>We're going to talk quickly about Tesla here.  They're coming out tonight with a Crossover SUV.  It's going to be very big news.  The Y, they will unveil it at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 11:00 p.m. Eastern.  They're going to live stream it on their website.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  You can see the stock up here one percent.  It is the sister car of the Model 3, but 10 percent bigger, 10 percent more expensive, and slightly less range.  This is the car that everybody wants to buy, the Crossover, the small SUV, is what's really selling in this country and frankly, across the world.  It will be made at the Gigafactory in Nevada.  That's the plan right now.  But lots of questions, of course, about Tesla, how it's dealing with its debt.  Those questions continue.  That company frankly in turmoil as it prepares to roll out this new Crossover, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Gerri Willis there on Wall Street pushing back on the Green New Deal.  Eleven house members are urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold hearings on the agenda championed by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Joining me now is Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Greg Walden.  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've got the letter in my hand from many of you -- from you and many of your colleagues who have signed on on the bottom line here.  You're urging the chairman to put hearings on this.  Why?  What's the point?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, we know from history that the last time this happened, Speaker Pelosi told the National Association of CountiesCongress had to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it.  We don't want that to happen here.  Look, the American people have a right to know what's in the Green New Deal, the effect it will have on their energy prices, on climate, on jobs.  The AFL-CIO yesterday came out and said millions of workers in America would be adversely affected by the Green New Deal.  Independent think tanks have said it caused out a $93 trillion would increase your energy bills by 22 percent.</p><p>We have a right to know what the left is doing here, what the Socialist Democrats are doing here, and my fear is they're going to cram through Congress like they've done other legislation, not give due process, not give hearings, and all we're asking for is let's have a hearing on this legislation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we've been poking --</p><p>WALDEN:  Roll out your plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- holes in this plan from the get-go, on this program --</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of the cost.  As you said, $93 trillion.  And also because, well, frankly, it doesn't make any sense to do away with fossil fuels within 10 years.  We've have spoken with scientists and it's -- it can't be done basically.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think that a hearing would educate the people?  I mean the pushback that we've gotten Dagen, right, is that this is just broad strokes.  This is just an idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad strokes like let's get rid of all --</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- fossil fuels in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And livestock --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which, by the way, if --</p><p>WALDEN:  And airplanes and everything else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And these are pretty radical broad strokes, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  This is pretty off the canvas stuff.  And there would be policy that would follow, we know that.  Look, we're open --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, let me bring Dagen in.  Let me bring Dagen in because we've both been really been poking holes in this from the get-go, Dagen.</p><p>WALDEN:  Good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would hurt the poor in America --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and lower income Americans more than anybody else.  We use fossil fuel, we use gasoline and natural gas because there are plentiful in the United States and inexpensive, number one.  We are not a nation, given its size, that we can get around places on light rail.  We saw the boondoggle out in California --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which, again, has basically -- most of it has been shelved, the light rail project, the high speed trains there.  Also, we're a leader in reducing emissions on the global stage.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the world in part because of natural gas.  Emissions since 2005 have fallen 30 percent coming out of electric power plants because of the use of natural gas.  So I don't -- again, did she cook this up at the bar late one night before she won her congressional seat after a little too much tequila?  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, I -- that's all spot-on.  By the way, we have a housing crisis in my state and in my district, and this would drive up the cost of housing.  You see what's happening in California with some of their radical ideas.  The Civil Liberties Union and others are suing because the impact it has on the poor to drive up the cost of housing.  Look, we have innovative ideas to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change as Republicans.  We want an opportunity to put our ideas forward.  , and to your point, by leading on energy development and discovery, by leading on innovation like battery storage, by putting forward new nuclear technologies, we can make the math add up but their math doesn't add up when you're going a hundred percent renewables in 10 years.</p><p>They want to get rid of livestock, airplanes.  My district would stretch from the Atlantic to Ohio.  There's no high speed rail going to get me home and around that district.  And livestock's our number two ag commodity in my district and they want to get rid of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to --</p><p>WALDEN:  I mean this -- none of this adds up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to be clear -- I just want to be clear about something.  I'm not making fun of this woman's job.  We've all worked at some -- at one -- at one point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- tending bar --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was the coat check girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- wait -- right.  Waiting tables.  We're not making fun of that.  But we are making -- we are calling out somebody who's has gotten a lot of attention because one, she's an attractive woman and she's young and she knows how to use social media very well and personally, as a woman, I want her to be better.  I want her to be smarter.  I don't want her to spout nonsense, things that are not true about the unemployment rate in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how, you know, how many hours a week the average American works.</p><p>WALDEN:  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just learn some facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's be clear.  Nancy Pelosi is not going to put this down for a vote.  I mean Congressman, your letter is urging the speaker to do that, but she's already locked arms with AOC.</p><p>WALDEN:  We're asking for hearings.  We're asking for hearings.  Let's take a look at it.  And what you haven't touched on is the fact the Green New Deal also includes a full government takeover of your health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Read the data today coming out of England about wait times for cancer patients to get treatment.  They're not meeting any of their mandates, any of their goals here.  And we don't want long wait times in America and that's $32 trillion, a complete government takeover.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALDEN:  And so there -- this is much more than just climate contained in the socialist manifesto.  And I think Americans have the right to know and as members of Congress, I don't want this thing pulled up quickly and voted on without us having a chance to go through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And that's what we're asking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a good point.</p><p>WALDEN:  Can't we just have hearings?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think you'll have the hearing?  You think you'll have hearings on all of this?</p><p>WALDEN:  I certainly hope so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  You know, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a record of bipartisan work in these matters and I think there's an opportunity we should have a hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>WALDEN:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Greg Walden there.  Breaking news on Tesla, the company is announcing Zachary Kirkhorn the new Chief Financial Officer.  Company also naming a new Chief Accounting Officer.  This just coming out right now with these new appointments.  CFO and new accounting officer at Tesla, stock is up, better than one percent right now.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Boeing is battling a major crisis.  The U.S. has grounded all Boeing 737 Max aircrafts.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.</p><p>Then the big business of gaming, EA Games reportedly paying the world's top gamer a million dollars to play and promote the launch of Apex Legends.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Superstars came out to play on day eight at the BNP Paribas Open.  Roger Federer continued his excellent run off form as he look for a record sixth title in the desert.  The 20-time major champion eased past Great Britain's Kyle Edmund in straight sets to punch his ticket into the elite eight.</p><p>Federer moves on to face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz for a spot in the final four.  Earlier, Rafael Nadal barely broke a sweat as he dispatched Philipp Krajinovic to reach the quarters.  The Spaniard closing out the impressive win at 6-4 after just under an hour and a half on court.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from the California Desert on Tennis Channel.  Our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Federal Aviation Administration is grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes in the U.S.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I'm trying to put myself in the position of being an airline which has one of these Max jets on order.  After all, there are 4,000 of these jets that are on order from Boeing, so you got airlines all around the world waiting to take delivery.  Some of them are about to take delivery.  What do they do?  Here they've ordered a plane, which is now not allowed to fly.  Do they take delivery?  Do they have some kind of financial accommodation with Boeing?  And this is not going to be fixed very quickly.  The black box in the Ethiopian crash has been taken to Paris.  It was badly damaged.  They have special equipment there to get inside the thing and find out what happened.</p><p>That's going to take weeks, maybe months.  So, it's a very long time before you find out exactly what happened, what is the problem with these jets and how do you fix it.  In other words, you've got all these orders that are going out there and will the airlines take delivery?  What's going to happen? It's the great unknown and I think it's a huge negative for Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's what I got to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  huge, huge negative, for sure.  I think, Stuart, this company is down 25 billion in market value --</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- just since the Ethiopian crash.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  We've seen an impact, we'll probably see a continued one.</p><p>VARNEY:  I have no idea the financial impact on Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  But in the immediate term, there is going to be a negative financial impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  How it works out, don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you'll have more in about 10 minutes.  Stu, we'll see you then.  Thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>First though, college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million bond after appearing in court for alleged bribery to get her daughter into an elite university.  We've got the very latest there.  And then game on, the world's top computer gamer, Ninja, reportedly making $1 million to promote the launch of Apex Legends.  The business of gaming after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More to that college admissions scandal.  Lori Loughlin released on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to face a Boston judge with Felicity Huffman on March 29th.  CEO Gregory Abbott and his wife, Marcia, also reportedly bought their daughter's way into school.  Their son, Malcolm, coming to their defense while smoking pot on the streets of New York and promoting his mixtape, saying this, \"They're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.  I believe everyone has a right to go to college, man.\"</p><p>Joining me right now, reaction, is FOX News Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, Kat Timpf, Former Obama Campaign Adviser and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, Axios Markets Newsletter Author, and FOX News Contributor and National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you, guys.  Well, I mean just the idea that he's on the streets of New York smoking marijuana in the face of this, what is he thinking?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER AUTHOR:  That's not even a misdemeanor anymore, right?  Now in de Blasio's New York, you know, that's just like getting a traffic ticket.  So, hey, maybe his mixtape is hot, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's still --</p><p>RABOUIN:  Maybe it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- not legal in New York for --</p><p>RABOUIN:  No, no, it's not legal, but it's basically like getting a traffic ticket at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's gross.  I'm so sick of smelling weed.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN ADVISER AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I was just going to say I can't walk down the street without getting caught in a cloud of weed smoke.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean it's probably going to go -- to go legal at some point.  But the real point is it's not and this guy is sort of sticking his nose, you know, sticking his finger in the hurt by doing this.</p><p>BIRO:  Yes.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This is what happens when you have parents who will get you out of anything and everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right,</p><p>TIMPF:  And who will do anything for you.  They make you so entitled --</p><p>BIRO:  Entitlement.</p><p>TIMPF:  -- that this guy is saying, \"Oh, I'm going to be a rap star.  I bet you -- \" I mean I've not heard -- and I've not heard his CD, but I do not plan to listen to it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Mixtape.</p><p>RABOUIN:  His mixtape -- his mixtape might be hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  His mixtape --</p><p>TIMPF:  I just -- this is what happens when you're so entitled and you know your parents will get you out of anything.  This is the way that you behave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I thought --</p><p>BIRO:  I'm not buying that mixtape at the gas station.</p><p>TIMPF:  No.  I hope his parents didn't spend money on him getting into college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  They probably buy him weed.</p><p>RABOUIN:  I think they did.  I think this one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you -- do you think all the students involved are either going to be pulled out or it's too late for that?  I mean they're not going to -- they're obviously not going to let anyone in who attempted to cheat.</p><p>BIRO:  Like I said, pull them out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BIRO:  And send them to military school.  As a vet, I'm all for it.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Well, this scandal's been going on for years.  I think they tracked it back to 2011 to 2018.  So, some of these kids I think are still in college.  Some of these kids probably have their degrees already and have moved on.  Maybe they have jobs in, you know, prestigious firms.  Who knows?  Obviously some are out selling mixtapes on the street and smoking marijuana, but, you know, these kids are -- a lot of them I think have probably already graduated and moved on and really what do you do?  You can't take the degree back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder how the students did in school given the fact they did pay their way in.  Hey, how about this?  Pay for play.  Fortnite, great Tyler Blevins, known as Ninja, reportedly made $1 million for promoting the competition, Apex Legends.  So, he's being paid to promote this.</p><p>TIMPF:  What a life, to get paid for playing videogames.  Everyone else plays videogames to the detriment of their career.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that good for him, wonderful, but I don't think kids should look at this and say, \"See, mom and dad?\"</p><p>BIRO:  That's what I want to do.</p><p>TIMPF:  \"I don't got to do my homework.  I'm going to be a millionaire by playing videogames.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If it works for him.</p><p>BIRO: But hey, if Kendall Jenner can get a quarter of a million dollars for one post on Instagram to promote the Fyre Festival, why not?</p><p>RABOUIN:  And this is from the market's perspective, this was really a great thing for EA.  They were falling behind other video game makers.  Fortnite has really sucked all the air out of the videogame space and this really got EA back on top.  I think they've got about 50 million users playing this game right now, which was the biggest launch in I think a long time, at least since Fortnite's been out.  And their stock has really responded as a result, so.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm a capitalist.  I'm all for people making money, whether it's through promoting videogames, reality T.V., like, you know, whatever.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Whatever, as long as you're making money, I'm not into socialism and free everything.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, speaking of making money, listen to this.  There are now more wealthy households in the United States equivalent to the entire population of Sweden.  Last year, more than 10.2 million households saw a net worth of $1 million to $5 million breaking a new record, according to a spectrum group survey.  Pretty good stuff that you're seeing --</p><p>BIRO:  Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- so many millionaires in the U.S. and people lift out of poverty.  That's capitalism.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Absolutely.  It's a great thing.  It's so hip to sort of demonize people for being successful, but that's not what this country is supposed to be out -- about.  I don't understand where we reached the point where successful equals bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  And, no, that's a great thing.  It's a wonderful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think about this whole debate about capitalism versus socialism?  Good op-ed in The Journal today by Dan Henninger, socialism, yes, be afraid.</p><p>TIMPF:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts.  Dion.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Look, I don't know that socialism is coming to America.  And, again, there are lots of different types of socialism.  There's -- you've got Bernie on the left saying he wants Democratic Socialism, which it's important to point out is very different from what's happening in Venezuela and the situation there.  You've also got places like Norway that have socialism, you've got Chile who had a socialist president.  So, what that means is there's a lot of different things.  I think a lot of people are quick to point at something and call it socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's be clear --</p><p>RABOUIN:  It's a broad spectrum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is federal -- this is a federal takeover of certain industries.  And that's what Medicare For All is.</p><p>RABOUIN:  But that's not what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what this Green New Deal is.  So, these are socialist policies.</p><p>BIRO:  I'm a little interested to see Nancy Pelosi herself pushing back on some of these.  Basically with the Green Deal she kind of said, \"Yes, that's cute,\" and just moved on.  So, as a Democrat myself I was a little but relieved because I'm scared.  I'm more of the, you know, I'm a Southern Democrat so this socialism stuff kind of scares me a little bit, honestly.</p><p>TIMPF:  There's no doubt that the polling shows that Millennials and Generation Z are more in favor of socialism than any other generation.</p><p>BIRO:  Right.</p><p>TIMPF:  I just don't think they totally understand what it is.  They think it's wearing like a Che Guevara T-shirt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  Great Millennial panel, guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it.  Kat Timpf, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, and Morgan Ortagus.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, March 14th. Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Grounded. President Trump has announced that he's keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say the Ethiopian Airlines crash show similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation. At the center of that probe, the social media giant's data deals with technology companies. It comes after a major outage hits Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are lower this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down 26 points on the Dow. That's well off of the lows of the morning. The S&amp;P is down two and the NASDAQ is now slipped into positive territory, it is up four points. This after a wild day yesterday on Wall Street when all was set and done the major indices finished strong up 148 points on the Dow industrials yesterday, two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P was up 19, the NASDAQ was up 52. Two-thirds of a percent there as well. In Europe this morning, markets are higher across the board. FT-100 up 48, CAC Quarante up 35, DAX Index up 21. In Asia overnight, mixed performance. Worst performer was China. Shanghai Composite down 1-1/4 percent.</p><p>A deadly and historic blizzard bringing hurricane force winds to central U.S. And those winds causing this tractor trailer to completely flip over in Texas.</p><p>Out on bond. Actress Lori Loughlin posting a million after appearing in court for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal.</p><p>Plus, pay to play. A new report says electronic arts paid top gamer ninja a million dollars to promote Apex legends. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst, Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you.</p><p>FORBES: Lot of news, especially on the college front. This big overhang is still China. Where we get that trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. We haven't heard when this meeting is between President Trump and Xi Jinping. Now the President says they're pushing it off until April.</p><p>FORBES: And you have to wonder, does this mean they're close to a deal but they're trying to get last-minute concessions and they're planning to seek --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or not close at all.</p><p>ORTAGUS: I think you hit the nail on the head earlier, Steve. It's all about enforcement, right? What is he going to -- we talked about this on the show just a few weeks ago. What is Xi going to say to Trump that he didn't already promise in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama? How do we hold their feet to the fire? How do we enforce these things? That's what's crucial for me for this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And the U.S. wants to be able to put tariffs back in place, should the Chinese not follow through on their promises. The Chinese say well, then we want that as well.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. The Chinese are never going to agree to that. But the key thing is not just the enforcement mechanism. It's the ability or the willingness of the United States to enforce agreements. We haven't done it consistently in the past. That's why this Huawei thing is so important. We are now going to do it in the future. I think that weighs more than any mechanism.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And I will quickly point to a great, what they call in journalism, a tick-tock in the Wall Street Journal about this college cheating scandal. And it all started with one guy, a financial executive who was being pursued on securities fraud charges and he told investigators, oh, I got something much bigger for you. And he pointed to the Yale Soccer coach wore a wire, meeting with him in Boston, who asked the individual, this coach asked for a $450,000 payout to get a kid into Yale and there, the ball started rolling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was surveillance, phones being tapped of the mastermind, Rick Singer. He was recording conversations. He tried to tip off about half a dozen of the families that he was wearing a wire and that they ought to be careful but again, 33 parents charged so far. Lori Loughlin out on -- a million dollars bail is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So he was trying to get his securities issues lessened. He was under securities investigation and that's how he did it. By saying look over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People with money can be very, very stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Meanwhile, the U.S. is grounding the entire Boeing 737 Max fleet after the deadly crash in Ethiopia. Jeff flock is covering the story. He's live at O'Hare International Airport this morning in Chicago. Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning. One- two punch to air travelers today. Both the storm canceling flights as well as the grounding of those aircraft, the 737 Maxes. Take a look at the board at O'Hare. If you see yellow or red, that means your flight is either canceled or delayed. The grounding of the 737s announced by the President yesterday. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern. All of those planes are grounded effective immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK: Latest on the investigation, one, the black box now to France to be analyzed but as you reported earlier, Maria, similarities in the two crashes. That leading the FAA to say we better shut it all down. People being rebooked now but as we said, some of the flights canceled. Now, as you reported also, a fairly small number of planes in the air that are 737 Maxes or at least were in the air. Southwest, the biggest among them.</p><p>But if you look at the overall fleet, take a look at those numbers, the overall U.S. Air fleet is about 7,000 or more aircraft. The number grounded, less than 70. You can do the math on that. It's less than one percent. We have the latest number of delays and cancellations and I would say the Lion's share of these are as a result of the so-called bomb cyclone. Don't like that term, but there you go.</p><p>490 delays and over 1,000 cancellations, the majority of those coming in Denver. Number two on the list here in Chicago. We're at least number two on the list. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right, Jeff, thanks very much. We'll keep following that. Jeff Flock in Chicago this morning. I want to turn to the race for 2020 now. Beto O'Rourke has thrown his hat in the ring officially for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D) TEXAS: This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us. The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate have never been greater.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor, Karl Rove. Karl, great to see you.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. How are you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm great. Want to get to your op-ed on AOC in a second. But first, your reaction to Beto announcing his bid.</p><p>ROVE: Am I the only one who thinks it's ironic that he sort of makes his announcement in a long interview in a magazine with vanity in its title?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROVE: Look, it was revealing -- it was a revealing interview, though. He said you know what, I never prepare my speeches which is why he said he's a reckless guy as a result. So that's what led him to say I don't think there's nothing more American than taking a knee, law enforcement is the Jim -- new Jim Crow-ism. We heard him recently in El Paso say, yes, I'm in favor of tearing down all the fences and borders between us and Mexico.</p><p>It's why when he went out to campaign in Texas in 2017 and '18 and went to all 254 counties, he would go to these small towns and give a speech to the local group of Democrats and routinely drop the F-bomb. And that was OK, I guess, for the hip parts of Dallas and Austin and Houston, but when you're out in Friona or Jacksonville or Cuero, those people are church-going people even if they're Democrats and by god, you don't use the F-bomb in front of polite people. I mean, he's a little bit reckless.</p><p>FORBES: So what's the attraction, Karl? Other than he's a pretty boy and nearly beat Ted Cruz, who had his own popularity issues in Texas? What's the fascination with this guy? Should we take him seriously?</p><p>ROVE: Well, -- Steve, glad you asked. I've got a white board here. Some -- for the interview as well. For the interview as well. You can't -- he said, you know, you can't hide from whom you are. And he's right. And he's got charisma and natural authenticity and a comfort level about being around people and being in the public arena and that will be helpful to him. He talks in the article about how he is more enthused about talking about what he is for than what he is against.</p><p>And I think it's going to be an important element in the 2020 campaign for any Democrat. He said I got to have a campaign that looks like America. He realizes that he's a white guy so he's going to have a campaign and pledges an administration that looks like America. So we're going to see a lot of -- a lot of women and we're going to see a lot of people of color in his campaign. He says, I will work with republicans. I did it when I was in Congress.</p><p>I will do it as President which is going to be unique. Is Elizabeth Warren going to say, Bernie Sanders going to say, Kamala Harris going to say, oh, I'm going to work with Republicans? And then remember, he raised $80 million for a Senate race. The question is how many of those donors are going to stick with him. But that's a big starting point that makes it -- makes it possible for him to be competitive. The real question's going to be what's the message?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROVE: And we've got a little bit of a sense of it. It's like hope and optimism, we're a great country, we faced big challenges but we can overcome them. We'll see how this goes. The big challenge for him is going to be his Senate race where he got close to Ted Cruz is not going to be like the Presidential race because Ted Cruz ignored him. He gave him 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 and virtually all of 2018 to go out there and be by himself projecting a message to the voters and only in late September and October did Cruz engage with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, really? OK.</p><p>ROVE: He's going to be engaged with right away by a bunch of Democrats. We'll see how he handles it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Karl, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>ROVE: Dagen? Of course it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"Here's Beto O'Rourke,\" the challenges we face are the greatest in living memory. OK. Not the Great Depression, not Pearl Harbor, not World War II, not the Cold War, not the Cuban Missile Crisis, not the 70s with the Sky High guest, not 9/11, not the 2008 financial crisis. Down south we say don't spit in my face and tell me it's raining.</p><p>ROVE: Yes, yes. This is going to be a problem for all the Democrats of hyperventilating about how bad the country is but remember that helps them inside their party. There are -- there are -- the core of the Democratic base does believe the biggest threat we have faced in our lifetimes is the presence of Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office. This is I think Robert Francis O'Rourke's attempt to negotiate around this.</p><p>And look, please, let's not refer to him by the fake name -- nickname that he did not use at Woodbury Forest, that he did not use at Colombia, that he did not use as an adult when he was -- when he was in a grunge band but only started to reemphasize when he ran for the city council in a heavily Latino town, El Paso, Texas. Let's please refer to him by the name that he appears on the ballot as Robert Francis O'Rourke. Please. Let's do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, wait, wait. He went to Woodbury? Well, that's an elitist private school in Orange, Virginia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's that about?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.</p><p>ROVE: Well, he was there -- he was there when it was not co-ed. So -- and he went to Colombia. As I remember, that's sort of a private elite institution on the upper west side of New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So he just started using it when he ran for office. That's interesting because I was just asking the panel about Beto and Robert Francis and why now we're calling him Beto. I mean, he's Irish, right?</p><p>ROVE: Well, he's Robert Francis O'Rourke. Yes. And look, if you want a want a nickname, let's give him what his name represents RFOR. Robert Francis O'Rourke. RFOR. Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Karl, before you go, you got to talk to us about your op-ed this morning in the Journal. American history as told by AOC.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. I listened to her speech here in Austin at south by southwest and it is jaw-dropping. Look, of course, we were going to have her and the moderator immediately say Donald J. Trump is a racist but Ronald Reagan is a racist and why, because he talked about a woman who bilked welfare in the 70s out of $150,000 and he called her -- he didn't call her welfare queen. Others did.</p><p>But AOC says well, that was racist. Well, the woman was white. Please tell me what's racist about that. And then FDR --</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about the new deal? The new deal too.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. The new deal was racist because it expanded, it legit -- it literally gave mortgage relief to white people but not to black people and as a result, the housing gap, the wealth gap grew because of the racist policies of Franklin Roosevelt. Well, first of all, it is not borne out by the facts. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation did not expand the difference between home ownership between blacks and whites.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROVE: And it's just jaw-dropping.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And she said it does not -- it does not feel good to live in America today. I mean, what in the world are these people living in?</p><p>ROVE: Exactly. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The America is the highlight of the world. I mean, particularly now, where you've got this economy that is -- that is firing on all cylinders.</p><p>FORBES: You know, we're raising money here to give her a ticket to Venezuela.</p><p>ROVE: Well, you know what, that private charity is wrong. The government should pay for the ticket to Venezuela. Please. Private charity is bad. It's -- that's merely an expression of the wealthy who have been stealing the money from -- what I loved was she was talking about ordinary people, ordinary working people and her audience had to pay between $1300 and $1600 for their tickets that allowed her to go -- that allowed them to go in. They had all access premium passes in order to go see AOC.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they did and she had a packed house. Karl, it's good to see you. Thanks so much. Karl Rove.</p><p>ROVE: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great op-ed. Coming up, trouble for Facebook. The social media giant reportedly facing a criminal investigation now for handing over user data to major tech companies without permission. The fallout, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, it's been something else. Good morning again. Nearly 3100 flights canceled over two days, most of them at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there. Wind gusts as strong as 80 miles per hour. Now, the Colorado police officer -- elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.</p><p>Now, let's go to Texas. Small planes overturned in the municipal airport by high winds. They looked like toys. Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico, sweeping a train right off of the tracks. And then there is some stunning video out of Texas. Look at this. Strong winds blowing over a tractor trailer. And this wasn't the only one. There's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over. No word, folks, of the condition of this driver, if he's OK or not. But wow, something else.</p><p>OK. Shares of General Electric lower in the premarket. They're forecasting adjusted earnings between 50 and 60 cents per share this year. That is below analyst expectations of around 70 cents. G.E. also says its industrial operations could burn about two billion more cash than they generated in 2018. There is the stock, actually it's higher in the premarket, 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>And then there is this. Next year's Major League Home Run Derby winner is going to reportedly get a nice little bonus, $1 million. That is according to the new agreement between the MLB and the players association. Other changes coming to the league include a single trade deadline and a three batter minimum for pitchers. All that starts in 2020. And those are your headlines, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thank you. Coming up, Facebook is under fire this morning. The technology giant reportedly now under criminal investigation for the company sharing user data with more than 150 of the largest technology companies out there without permission.</p><p>Then game on. E.A. games reportedly paying the world's most followed gamer $1 million to play and promote the launch of Apex legends. The big business of gaming, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook is under fire once again. The company reportedly facing a criminal investigation over controversial data sharing deals with technology giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft. Now, Facebook reportedly gave access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its users to those tech companies. This after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatApp across the globe yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is former prosecutor and criminal defense attorney at the Bianchi Law Group, David Bruno. David, good to have you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, PARTNER, THE BIANCHI LAW GROUP: Good morning. And thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the Facebook news.</p><p>BRUNO: Yes. This is -- the information comes from the New York Times through unnamed sources so let's start there. But if there's a grand jury investigation out of the district, it's criminal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BRUNO: It's criminal. This is unrelated to any of the administrative action, unrelated to the consent order, unrelated to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are the implications of a criminal investigation for Facebook?</p><p>BRUNO: Well, the grand jury subpoenas mean nothing, right? Because when we talk about criminal, you got to talk about presumption of innocence. Even for somebody that's charged, there's a presumption of innocence. And there's even more caution when it's just a grand jury subpoena. So in the event that crimes have been violated, it could be the corporation generally, could be individual officers, could be board members. You know, it's limitless when you talk about criminal law.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's not just this investigation. This is in the Eastern district of New York. There's also a securities fraud investigation going on within the Justice Department in the Northern District of California related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. There's the FTC looking into its behavior, did it basically violate a consent agreement that it signed in 2011 over again, shared data that deceived customers and consumers.</p><p>And then also, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into their behavior. And what's going on is they keep saying that they're fixing problems, we're not doing this, and it turns up time and time again that they're not being quite frankly honest with the American people and regulators.</p><p>BRUNO: Great point. Especially on the consent order. Because they had problems releasing consumer data before the consent order in 2011. That's why there's a consent order. And they agreed not to release without the consent of the consumers. So the Cambridge Analytica issue is a potential violation and they're still looking at that. Like you said, that's the California stuff. But it's interesting because New York is different. I think the New York investigation is completely different than Cambridge Analytica, which could sign -- be a sign for problems for safety.</p><p>FORBES: So what exactly in New York is the crime they think?</p><p>BRUNO: Even Times article itself says we don't know. We don't know how long it's been open and we don't know what the scope is. All they know is that these two unnamed cell phone companies received grand jury subpoenas. That's going to be subpoena duces tecum for records. So they're probably looking at the agreement between Facebook and the cell phone companies as well as any data that was received in exchange between the two.</p><p>ORTAGUS: This is totally separate from Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the big tech companies but it certainly adds, you know, more political pressure and more weight to her proposal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think they'll break up? They will be forced to break up?</p><p>BRUNO: I was talking about this in the morning show a couple days ago. I think ultimately, yes. But right now, no. It would be under the antitrust laws. They could -- they could proceed under those laws or through new laws by Congress. That would potentially be something that could affect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congress will start by putting up roadblocks to additional acquisitions by these companies. Again, buying up the smaller companies and essentially buying them up and then shutting them down just to own and sit on top of technology that might be valuable and increase their market share. That would be the first step. It won't be breaking a lot.</p><p>BRUNO: When is Congress going to act? This was in the forefront last year when we were talking about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, they got --</p><p>BREAM: This is a completely different --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They got many of the CEOs to come down and testify --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUNO: Yes, exactly. Zuckerberg himself testified last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: David, good to see you. Thanks so much. David Bruno there. We'll take a short break. When we come back, Tesla is gearing up for a big reveal. The company will unveil its Model Y SUV later today. We will tell you what to expect when we come back.</p><p>And then the college cheat scheme. Actress Lori Loughlin posted a million dollars in bond after appearing in Federal court yesterday while her daughter was reportedly onboard the yacht of the chairman of the USC's board of trustees. When the scandal actually broke, the outrage coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 14th. Your top stories right now, 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news, we're getting readings on initial Jobless Claims and Import/Export Prices. You'll see it on the screen momentarily. Futures, meanwhile, off of the lows of the morning. Dow Industrials now showing a decline of just 10 points. S&amp;P 500 is unchanged, exactly where it closed yesterday. And the NASDAQ is up six points currently. In Europe this morning, gains across the board, pretty much all morning this morning. European indices look like this. Jobless Claims coming out, 229,000 as you can see. And the Ft-100 is up 41 points. The CAC Quarante is up 35 points. And the DAX Index in Germany up 39.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. Shanghai was the worst performer, down 1-1/4 percent. Pushing back on the Green New Deal, top Republicans are calling for a hearing on the controversial Green Deal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Onto the latest on the college cheating scandal, one of the parents who was arrested, his son coming to his defense while casually smoking marijuana on the streets of New York City. Wait until you see this. Then pay to play, a new report says Electronic Arts paid top gamer, Ninja, $1 million to promote Apex Legends, all those stories coming up. But first, new economic data out this morning. We've got the Initial Jobless claims number. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at a market that is pretty much back and forth, positive and negative territory all morning. Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: That's right, Maria. We've been looking at these numbers. I was just talking with a trader, that's why my attention was not on you. Initial Jobless Claims, this is actually higher than anticipated. So, you know, I got to tell you, we had such great news on the jobs market so far. I'm not sure traders are going to pay a whole lot of attention to this. As you know, it's a very volatile number week to week, the four-week moving average, 226,250. We come in at 229,000. It's a little higher, but not anything that's likely to move the markets here. Import/export prices, this is a turnaround and interesting, because what we've had are import and export prices that have been declining. Now, a turnaround, higher and higher than anticipated. The question here, is the government actually dealing with the real numbers now after the shutdown? They're still trying to get it together, I think. And there could be noise in these numbers.</p><p>We're going to talk quickly about Tesla here. They're coming out tonight with a Crossover SUV. It's going to be very big news. The Y, they will unveil it at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 11:00 p.m. Eastern. They're going to live stream it on their website. This is going to be a lot of fun. You can see the stock up here one percent. It is the sister car of the Model 3, but 10 percent bigger, 10 percent more expensive, and slightly less range. This is the car that everybody wants to buy, the Crossover, the small SUV, is what's really selling in this country and frankly, across the world. It will be made at the Gigafactory in Nevada. That's the plan right now. But lots of questions, of course, about Tesla, how it's dealing with its debt. Those questions continue. That company frankly in turmoil as it prepares to roll out this new Crossover, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you. Gerri Willis there on Wall Street pushing back on the Green New Deal. Eleven house members are urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold hearings on the agenda championed by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Joining me now is Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Greg Walden. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE: Hey, good morning, Maria. You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I've got the letter in my hand from many of you -- from you and many of your colleagues who have signed on on the bottom line here. You're urging the chairman to put hearings on this. Why? What's the point?</p><p>WALDEN: Well, we know from history that the last time this happened, Speaker Pelosi told the National Association of CountiesCongress had to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it. We don't want that to happen here. Look, the American people have a right to know what's in the Green New Deal, the effect it will have on their energy prices, on climate, on jobs. The AFL-CIO yesterday came out and said millions of workers in America would be adversely affected by the Green New Deal. Independent think tanks have said it caused out a $93 trillion would increase your energy bills by 22 percent.</p><p>We have a right to know what the left is doing here, what the Socialist Democrats are doing here, and my fear is they're going to cram through Congress like they've done other legislation, not give due process, not give hearings, and all we're asking for is let's have a hearing on this legislation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, we've been poking --</p><p>WALDEN: Roll out your plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- holes in this plan from the get-go, on this program --</p><p>WALDEN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because of the cost. As you said, $93 trillion. And also because, well, frankly, it doesn't make any sense to do away with fossil fuels within 10 years. We've have spoken with scientists and it's -- it can't be done basically.</p><p>WALDEN: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you think that a hearing would educate the people? I mean the pushback that we've gotten Dagen, right, is that this is just broad strokes. This is just an idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, broad strokes like let's get rid of all --</p><p>WALDEN: Well, yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- fossil fuels in this country.</p><p>WALDEN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And livestock --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which, by the way, if --</p><p>WALDEN: And airplanes and everything else.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>WALDEN: And these are pretty radical broad strokes, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WALDEN: This is pretty off the canvas stuff. And there would be policy that would follow, we know that. Look, we're open --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Well, let me bring Dagen in. Let me bring Dagen in because we've both been really been poking holes in this from the get-go, Dagen.</p><p>WALDEN: Good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It would hurt the poor in America --</p><p>WALDEN: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and lower income Americans more than anybody else. We use fossil fuel, we use gasoline and natural gas because there are plentiful in the United States and inexpensive, number one. We are not a nation, given its size, that we can get around places on light rail. We saw the boondoggle out in California --</p><p>WALDEN: That's right. That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- which, again, has basically -- most of it has been shelved, the light rail project, the high speed trains there. Also, we're a leader in reducing emissions on the global stage.</p><p>WALDEN: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In the world in part because of natural gas. Emissions since 2005 have fallen 30 percent coming out of electric power plants because of the use of natural gas. So I don't -- again, did she cook this up at the bar late one night before she won her congressional seat after a little too much tequila? I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>WALDEN: Well, I -- that's all spot-on. By the way, we have a housing crisis in my state and in my district, and this would drive up the cost of housing. You see what's happening in California with some of their radical ideas. The Civil Liberties Union and others are suing because the impact it has on the poor to drive up the cost of housing. Look, we have innovative ideas to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change as Republicans. We want an opportunity to put our ideas forward. , and to your point, by leading on energy development and discovery, by leading on innovation like battery storage, by putting forward new nuclear technologies, we can make the math add up but their math doesn't add up when you're going a hundred percent renewables in 10 years.</p><p>They want to get rid of livestock, airplanes. My district would stretch from the Atlantic to Ohio. There's no high speed rail going to get me home and around that district. And livestock's our number two ag commodity in my district and they want to get rid of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just to --</p><p>WALDEN: I mean this -- none of this adds up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just to be clear -- I just want to be clear about something. I'm not making fun of this woman's job. We've all worked at some -- at one -- at one point --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- tending bar --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was the coat check girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- wait -- right. Waiting tables. We're not making fun of that. But we are making -- we are calling out somebody who's has gotten a lot of attention because one, she's an attractive woman and she's young and she knows how to use social media very well and personally, as a woman, I want her to be better. I want her to be smarter. I don't want her to spout nonsense, things that are not true about the unemployment rate in this country.</p><p>WALDEN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And how, you know, how many hours a week the average American works.</p><p>WALDEN: Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just learn some facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but let's be clear. Nancy Pelosi is not going to put this down for a vote. I mean Congressman, your letter is urging the speaker to do that, but she's already locked arms with AOC.</p><p>WALDEN: We're asking for hearings. We're asking for hearings. Let's take a look at it. And what you haven't touched on is the fact the Green New Deal also includes a full government takeover of your health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>WALDEN: Read the data today coming out of England about wait times for cancer patients to get treatment. They're not meeting any of their mandates, any of their goals here. And we don't want long wait times in America and that's $32 trillion, a complete government takeover.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible.</p><p>WALDEN: And so there -- this is much more than just climate contained in the socialist manifesto. And I think Americans have the right to know and as members of Congress, I don't want this thing pulled up quickly and voted on without us having a chance to go through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WALDEN: And that's what we're asking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you make a good point.</p><p>WALDEN: Can't we just have hearings?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think you'll have the hearing? You think you'll have hearings on all of this?</p><p>WALDEN: I certainly hope so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>WALDEN: You know, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a record of bipartisan work in these matters and I think there's an opportunity we should have a hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>WALDEN: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Greg Walden there. Breaking news on Tesla, the company is announcing Zachary Kirkhorn the new Chief Financial Officer. Company also naming a new Chief Accounting Officer. This just coming out right now with these new appointments. CFO and new accounting officer at Tesla, stock is up, better than one percent right now. We'll take a short break. When we come back, Boeing is battling a major crisis. The U.S. has grounded all Boeing 737 Max aircrafts. Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.</p><p>Then the big business of gaming, EA Games reportedly paying the world's top gamer a million dollars to play and promote the launch of Apex Legends. But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report. For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger. The Superstars came out to play on day eight at the BNP Paribas Open. Roger Federer continued his excellent run off form as he look for a record sixth title in the desert. The 20-time major champion eased past Great Britain's Kyle Edmund in straight sets to punch his ticket into the elite eight.</p><p>Federer moves on to face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz for a spot in the final four. Earlier, Rafael Nadal barely broke a sweat as he dispatched Philipp Krajinovic to reach the quarters. The Spaniard closing out the impressive win at 6-4 after just under an hour and a half on court. And don't forget, you can watch all the action from the California Desert on Tennis Channel. Our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the Federal Aviation Administration is grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes in the U.S. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. I'm trying to put myself in the position of being an airline which has one of these Max jets on order. After all, there are 4,000 of these jets that are on order from Boeing, so you got airlines all around the world waiting to take delivery. Some of them are about to take delivery. What do they do? Here they've ordered a plane, which is now not allowed to fly. Do they take delivery? Do they have some kind of financial accommodation with Boeing? And this is not going to be fixed very quickly. The black box in the Ethiopian crash has been taken to Paris. It was badly damaged. They have special equipment there to get inside the thing and find out what happened.</p><p>That's going to take weeks, maybe months. So, it's a very long time before you find out exactly what happened, what is the problem with these jets and how do you fix it. In other words, you've got all these orders that are going out there and will the airlines take delivery? What's going to happen? It's the great unknown and I think it's a huge negative for Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: That's what I got to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: huge, huge negative, for sure. I think, Stuart, this company is down 25 billion in market value --</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- just since the Ethiopian crash.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty incredible. We've seen an impact, we'll probably see a continued one.</p><p>VARNEY: I have no idea the financial impact on Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: But in the immediate term, there is going to be a negative financial impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure. Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: How it works out, don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you'll have more in about 10 minutes. Stu, we'll see you then. Thanks so much. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>First though, college cheat scheme. Actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million bond after appearing in court for alleged bribery to get her daughter into an elite university. We've got the very latest there. And then game on, the world's top computer gamer, Ninja, reportedly making $1 million to promote the launch of Apex Legends. The business of gaming after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More to that college admissions scandal. Lori Loughlin released on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to face a Boston judge with Felicity Huffman on March 29th. CEO Gregory Abbott and his wife, Marcia, also reportedly bought their daughter's way into school. Their son, Malcolm, coming to their defense while smoking pot on the streets of New York and promoting his mixtape, saying this, \"They're blowing this whole thing out of proportion. I believe everyone has a right to go to college, man.\"</p><p>Joining me right now, reaction, is FOX News Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, Kat Timpf, Former Obama Campaign Adviser and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, Axios Markets Newsletter Author, and FOX News Contributor and National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus. Great to see you, guys. Well, I mean just the idea that he's on the streets of New York smoking marijuana in the face of this, what is he thinking?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER AUTHOR: That's not even a misdemeanor anymore, right? Now in de Blasio's New York, you know, that's just like getting a traffic ticket. So, hey, maybe his mixtape is hot, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it's still --</p><p>RABOUIN: Maybe it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- not legal in New York for --</p><p>RABOUIN: No, no, it's not legal, but it's basically like getting a traffic ticket at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: It's gross. I'm so sick of smelling weed.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN ADVISER AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I was just going to say I can't walk down the street without getting caught in a cloud of weed smoke.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean it's probably going to go -- to go legal at some point. But the real point is it's not and this guy is sort of sticking his nose, you know, sticking his finger in the hurt by doing this.</p><p>BIRO: Yes.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is what happens when you have parents who will get you out of anything and everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right,</p><p>TIMPF: And who will do anything for you. They make you so entitled --</p><p>BIRO: Entitlement.</p><p>TIMPF: -- that this guy is saying, \"Oh, I'm going to be a rap star. I bet you -- \" I mean I've not heard -- and I've not heard his CD, but I do not plan to listen to it.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Mixtape.</p><p>RABOUIN: His mixtape -- his mixtape might be hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: His mixtape --</p><p>TIMPF: I just -- this is what happens when you're so entitled and you know your parents will get you out of anything. This is the way that you behave.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I thought --</p><p>BIRO: I'm not buying that mixtape at the gas station.</p><p>TIMPF: No. I hope his parents didn't spend money on him getting into college.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: They probably buy him weed.</p><p>RABOUIN: I think they did. I think this one --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you -- do you think all the students involved are either going to be pulled out or it's too late for that? I mean they're not going to -- they're obviously not going to let anyone in who attempted to cheat.</p><p>BIRO: Like I said, pull them out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BIRO: And send them to military school. As a vet, I'm all for it.</p><p>RABOUIN: Well, this scandal's been going on for years. I think they tracked it back to 2011 to 2018. So, some of these kids I think are still in college. Some of these kids probably have their degrees already and have moved on. Maybe they have jobs in, you know, prestigious firms. Who knows? Obviously some are out selling mixtapes on the street and smoking marijuana, but, you know, these kids are -- a lot of them I think have probably already graduated and moved on and really what do you do? You can't take the degree back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder how the students did in school given the fact they did pay their way in. Hey, how about this? Pay for play. Fortnite, great Tyler Blevins, known as Ninja, reportedly made $1 million for promoting the competition, Apex Legends. So, he's being paid to promote this.</p><p>TIMPF: What a life, to get paid for playing videogames. Everyone else plays videogames to the detriment of their career.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes.</p><p>TIMPF: I think that good for him, wonderful, but I don't think kids should look at this and say, \"See, mom and dad?\"</p><p>BIRO: That's what I want to do.</p><p>TIMPF: \"I don't got to do my homework. I'm going to be a millionaire by playing videogames.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: If it works for him.</p><p>BIRO: But hey, if Kendall Jenner can get a quarter of a million dollars for one post on Instagram to promote the Fyre Festival, why not?</p><p>RABOUIN: And this is from the market's perspective, this was really a great thing for EA. They were falling behind other video game makers. Fortnite has really sucked all the air out of the videogame space and this really got EA back on top. I think they've got about 50 million users playing this game right now, which was the biggest launch in I think a long time, at least since Fortnite's been out. And their stock has really responded as a result, so.</p><p>ORTAGUS: I'm a capitalist. I'm all for people making money, whether it's through promoting videogames, reality T.V., like, you know, whatever.</p><p>RABOUIN: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Whatever, as long as you're making money, I'm not into socialism and free everything.</p><p>RABOUIN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, speaking of making money, listen to this. There are now more wealthy households in the United States equivalent to the entire population of Sweden. Last year, more than 10.2 million households saw a net worth of $1 million to $5 million breaking a new record, according to a spectrum group survey. Pretty good stuff that you're seeing --</p><p>BIRO: Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- so many millionaires in the U.S. and people lift out of poverty. That's capitalism.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Absolutely. It's a great thing. It's so hip to sort of demonize people for being successful, but that's not what this country is supposed to be out -- about. I don't understand where we reached the point where successful equals bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TIMPF: And, no, that's a great thing. It's a wonderful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you think about this whole debate about capitalism versus socialism? Good op-ed in The Journal today by Dan Henninger, socialism, yes, be afraid.</p><p>TIMPF: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts. Dion.</p><p>RABOUIN: Look, I don't know that socialism is coming to America. And, again, there are lots of different types of socialism. There's -- you've got Bernie on the left saying he wants Democratic Socialism, which it's important to point out is very different from what's happening in Venezuela and the situation there. You've also got places like Norway that have socialism, you've got Chile who had a socialist president. So, what that means is there's a lot of different things. I think a lot of people are quick to point at something and call it socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, let's be clear --</p><p>RABOUIN: It's a broad spectrum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- this is federal -- this is a federal takeover of certain industries. And that's what Medicare For All is.</p><p>RABOUIN: But that's not what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what this Green New Deal is. So, these are socialist policies.</p><p>BIRO: I'm a little interested to see Nancy Pelosi herself pushing back on some of these. Basically with the Green Deal she kind of said, \"Yes, that's cute,\" and just moved on. So, as a Democrat myself I was a little but relieved because I'm scared. I'm more of the, you know, I'm a Southern Democrat so this socialism stuff kind of scares me a little bit, honestly.</p><p>TIMPF: There's no doubt that the polling shows that Millennials and Generation Z are more in favor of socialism than any other generation.</p><p>BIRO: Right.</p><p>TIMPF: I just don't think they totally understand what it is. They think it's wearing like a Che Guevara T-shirt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you're right. Great Millennial panel, guys. Thank you so much.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Thank you.</p><p>RABOUIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Appreciate it. Kat Timpf, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, and Morgan Ortagus. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great show. Dagen, Steve, Morgan, thank you.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Love you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: All right.

View original post here[2].Via RealVision.com,[3]If You Only Look At One ChartTime is short, so here is one chart to get you thinking in a new direction. Velocity of Money (M2) M x V = P x TSource:\u00a0Bloomberg The chart that no central banker wants you to see Velocity and inflation will continue to fall as long as debt compounds faster than GDP growth. The secular low in bond yields is still ahead of us. * * *Right Here, Right NowThe best trading ideas of the week from RVP ContributorsBuy\u00a0some InsuranceSays Stray Reflections[4] In the past two decades the VIX has closed below 10 on only 11 occasions, and 7 of those occasions were during the past month. </p><p>Sound normal? 'Low volatility begets high volatility. Some participants shared painful experiences that taught them consistently betting on higher volatility is a fool's errand. Better to buy puts as insurance when option pricing gets too cheap. With the S...00's realized volatility down to just 7% (it has been lower only 3% of the time since 1928), now seems like a good time.'Jawad Mian's[5] report suggests that now may be the time to buy some put options to take advantage of a potential spike in volatility. With the time value of options so low due to suppressed volatility, now might be the time to take out a little insurance. Remember, you can't get it cheap when you need it most. Even deeply out-of-the-money, long-dated options could experience an asymmetrical payout in the event of a major unexpected risk event.* * *The Big CallLegendary hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller said when you see something in the market that really, really excites you, 'Bet the ranch on it.' These are the Big Calls, the investment themes that can make or break you. Think\u00a0differently from the crowd and have a different time horizon, and you have an edge. RVP, with its crack team of financial minds, identifies the Big Calls and guides you through the investment opportunities when they present themselves.Bond YieldsIn Limbo or Playing Limbo? We often refer to the state of being 'in limbo' as stuck on the edge of hell with no resolution But remember, limbo is also a dance from Trinidad in which people compete to dance lower and lower under a bar until someone eventually collapses. This week in The Big Call we ask, how low can global bond yields go; and what could raise the bar, or will bond yields be stuck at current levels forever? Bond bull alive and kicking? The secular trend of declining bond yields has seen prices rise inexorably during a 30-year bull market. Our call from April 7th was to go long TLT on a short-term view - which has returned a decent 3.5% to date. But how long can this return continue in the face of rising leverage and deteriorating demographics? That's something we considered in the Are You On This Yet? section of The Hack on May 19th[6] Drowning in debt Jawad Mian's thought-provoking symposium this week, A Dozen Ideas to Get You Thinking Differently[7], sets up our discussion nicely: 'The US economic return on additional debt has fallen to about 20 cents on the dollar. That means 80 cents is servicing existing debt, which has been borrowed for the purpose of supporting unproductive consumption and jobs. This makes economic growth very sensitive to changes in interest rates.'The diminishing return of each new unit of debt is making it harder and harder for governments and corporations alike to juice their growth and returns. With debt levels so high, the service costs become punishing. To avoid a default, interest rates must remain structurally lower for longer just to support the present debt. Furthermore, the debt has to grow just to service the exisitng debt. Think about that for a second? Are higher rates already the death knell for the US economy? 'It would only take a 20% backup in interest rates before the debt service becomes problematic (depending on duration and the amount of outstanding debt). The 10-year Treasury yield nearly doubled from the summer 2016 low, which suggests the US economy is about to slow down, rather sooner than later.'The economy is slowing, and yet with these debt levels across the world, the growth rate required to get out from under them is essentially mathematically impossible to achieve:The path of least resistance for central banks becomes structurally lower interest rates, since a widespread debt jubilee is too politically unpopular, for now. That comes later. Central banks are stuck between a rock and a hard place. how to prevent those low rates blowing up (even bigger) asset bubbles how to keep banks profitable so they can recapitalise organically how to have any levers of monetary policy left during the next major downturn Across the world central banks are in a bind, and so developed bond markets are sleepwalking toward a Japanese-style scenario of negative bond yields and a deflationary psychology. * * *Global bonds - The world tourChina At the government level Chinese debt-to-GDP looks very reasonable at around 43%; but if we add in all the local debt, state-owned enterprises, and other forms of debt we get estimates of more like 250% of GDP, which makes China look rather Japanese[8]. China does, however, have one advantage, which is a high GDP growth rate that can be used to shrink that debt load - but with so much growth generated from debt-fuelled investment rather than consumption, it will be hard structurally to grow the economy whilst weaning it off the debt. Chinese government bond yields have been on the rise, which may actually reflect positive fundamentals in the economy. As Jim Walker's Wealthy Nations[9] observed in March, 'The rise in rates is a reflection of success and economic acceleration, not a reflection of economic problems. China will increase interest rates not because the authorities are worried about over-indebtedness and/or the amount of credit being extended.'Cyclically, then, China seems OK for now - the PBOC has been stepping in with liquidity when needed as they try to steer the economy towards some corrective actions. However, the jury is out on how long they can keep this up. For more in-depth consideration of Chinese debt dynamics, remember to check out CrossBorder Capital's 'The Financial Silk Road[10]'. US The 10-year Treasury currently yields around 2.2%, a very low return by historical standards, especially when debt-to-GDP has ballooned to over 100%. Both metrics are now at their post-war level. Will foreigners question the US's creditworthiness and abandon their debt? As long as the USD remains the global reserve currency, demand for dollar debt will be high; and only the US bond market has the depth for this size of capital flows - i.e. many holders of Treasuries buy them for reasons other than risk/reward. OK - but the world could abandon the dollar Sure, but what's the next largest alternative? The euro Greece The Grecian debt crisis is now entering its seventh year of tedium. In that time debt-to-GDP has mushroomed from 126% to 179% - a debt level no nation has ever emerged from without some form of default or devaluation. Yet Greek bond yields have fallen from &gt;30% in 2012 to just under 6% today. With a succession of bailouts, Greece has trundled along on life support. As the old Soviet joke goes, 'So long as they pretend to pay us, we will pretend to work'. But what do people who want euro-denominated collateral do, then? Germany The 10-year yields are on the floor - 0.25%! This is due to a flight to quality in the Eurozone: If the EU breaks up, you are best off with bunds because the Germans have greater fiscal rectitude (although debt/GDP is still near 70%), and a new Deutsche\u00a0Mark would be worth a lot more than a freshly minted drachma. So what are we learning here? Bond yields - especially government ones - are not really reflecting economic risk/reward anymore. They reflect a belief that central banks will ease into perpetuity - or at the very least a belief in the 'greater fool theory'. This isn't theoretical economics confined to classroom textbooks; we only have to look to Japan to see this train wreck in action. Japan Japan has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 250%! Yet the 10-year bond yields just a handful of basis points. What could possibly explain this? Deflation. Decades of deflation have meant that owners of any fixed monetary asset will see its value increase over time. Japan was stuck in a debt-deflation cycle until the recent advent of 'Abenomics' - the competitive devaluation and money-printing game that everybody else had been playing. Either way, Japan has avoided default through extremely low interest rates, extremely high domestic bond holdings, and a highly cohesive society, all in combination with a weak currency and an export-led economy. Is this the future for other developed sovereign bonds? The BoJ have only a plan A: Buy up all the bonds in issue. And after that? You can be sure that Japan will be at the vanguard of the next economic and monetary experiment. Remember that debt jubilee I mentioned? Japan Debt to GDP vs Japanese Bond YieldsSource: BloombergCould we see a bond scare?The reality appears to be, it's unlikely. Yes, an individual country like Greece can suffer a huge bond scare, but for larger nations with printing presses such as the US and Japan, the most likely outcome is simply more debt and more devaluation. And with plenty of money sloshing around chasing too few assets, bonds will probably continue to be bid. The only thing that would reliably kill the bond market is higher interest rates from central banks. The trouble is, higher rates would also kill the market for everything else and trigger a depression. Could an inflation scare occur? Demographics, unproductive debt, and technological advancements put the chance of a sustained period of inflation pretty low, despite (or because of) the best efforts of Central Bankers.Baby Boomers are compounding the problem.As we noted in The Hack on April 7th, 'Baby Boomers Coming of Age[11]', the backdrop of an ageing demographic and massive pension black holes will structurally cap any rise in interest rates. 'According to the Federal Reserve, unfunded state and local pension obligations have risen to $1.9 trillion from $292 billion since 2007. Throw in the private sector and that figure is far greater. At the same time pension funds have been pushed up the risk curve as interest rates from fixed income are simply inadequate. Baby Boomers have never been more exposed to equities and are going to start to drawdown their capital for retirement.'The paradox is this: To fill that black hole and provide fixed income for retirement, we need bond yields above, say, 5%; but with yields above 5% the ability to service the debt mountain collapses and assets are liquidated. Wealth is devastated. Then, all those retirees will be shifting assets from equities into fixed income in the next decade, driving a huge wall of money into a bond market with diminishing yields.What about cyclical considerations?We have been stating for some time that the credit cycle[12] is rolling over. Just last week Michael Lewitt[13] noted: 'I no longer expect interest rates to rise significantly from current levels in the current cycle; they are more likely to fall as the economy stays weak and debt continues to build in both the public and private sectors. We could see short-term 25 or 50 basis point spikes in longer rates (10-30 years) based on an errant comment by a central banker or some piece of news, but rates are likely to stay down until the current business cycle, which is very long-in-the-tooth, ends.'With the Fed raising rates into a slowdown, they will have to backpedal in the near future to soften the economic blow.How low can we go? The limbo continues - and the bar goes lower. For now, it is hard to see any alternative to more debt and lower rates. The inflection point where we could grow our way out of this debt straight jacket has passed. The secular low in interest rates appears to still be ahead of us. Are You On This Yet?In such a fast paced world staying on top of relevant market news and developments is tough. RVP scours the globe for the most interesting stories and distils them, keeping you ahead of the crowd.BrexitTax-it? Brexit may be hanging in your mind as one of those tail risks you are supposed to worry about but cannot quantify. In The Hack for May 26th[14] we looked at the importance of UK/EU trade and politics amidst what appears to be a messy divorce with a potential EUR 100bn price tag. The EU debt crisis remains the elephant in the room, with poor demographics, massive welfare commitments, huge debt loads, and a one-size-fits-all currency to bind the mix - the potential for a full-blown crisis remains as real as ever. Is the UK just the first rat to leave the ship?Is it all doom and gloom for Britain?This week Eurizon SLJ Capital[15] published an excellent report outlining the potential opportunity for the UK to become a tax haven upon exiting the EU. What if Britain just refuses to pay the ransom note, endures a hard exit, and then steals all the EU's corporate business? What if the breakaway from the EU allows Britain free rein to shape its own industrial policy? Stephen Jen of Eurizon SLJ Capital argues that once free from EU encumbrances, the UK could move forward with corporate tax cuts to fuel greater inward foreign direct investment (FDI). The UK is already the greatest recipient of FDI in Europe. The UK has a strong base of FDI due to credible institutions, strong rule of law, the English language, high-quality human capital, and good infrastructure. The opportunity for greater future FDI could be huge if the FDI stock matches that of other tax havens as a % of GDP: Check out Switzerland, Ireland and Luxembourg.Source: OECD , IMF, Datastream and Eurizon SLJ CapitalUK in the Sweet SpotIf the UK sparks a boom in FDI, taking business away from the Eurozone by having a more competitive corporate tax rate, that shift would have effects akin to the competitive devaluation of currencies we have seen since the GFC. But tax havens act differently: They have to be small enough to attract business away from larger economies but still large enough to retain the social and economic depth required to support large businesses. Britain appears to sit in the sweet spot: 'In the middle - what we call 'Middleweight' economies - we may have a sweet spot for corporate tax cuts. The loss in revenues from the reduction in the tax rate may be easily offset by the new inflows of foreign investments. If the costs for a company of operating in London were driven lower, we believe this would tilt the balance on FDI flows away from, say, Dublin. The point here is that larger and more sophisticated economies command a premium on smaller economies that can.'This analysis gives a read across for the Trump tax cuts for investors. As the US is a 'heavyweight' and really operates its tax system under its own gravity due the sheer weight of its GDP and global importance. In the case of the US, cutting corporate tax may actually hurt the fiscal situation rather than having the impact of attracting enough FDI to compensate for the tax cut.Surely cutting taxes blows up the fiscal balance sheet?It may be that reducing the corporation tax rate further to a 'sweet spot' actually attracts more investment from abroad and results in more job creation in the UK, putting money into the pockets of residents and giving the government a greater tax base from personal income. Corporate tax is after all a form of double taxation[16] - both the corporation and its shareholders are taxed on profits and then dividends.There's got to be more to Britain's chance of success than just tax cuts?To have a winning formula you also need industrial policy: 'It would make sense, in a medium-sized economy like that of the UK, for there to be (i) more guidance and leadership from the government and (ii) concentration of financial and intellectual resources in the development of industries In a globalised economy that offers 'winner-takes-all' propositions, or non-linear financial rewards, there is a role for the government to lead and nurture the industrial development process, in our view.'\u00a0Currently the UK ranks no. 7 in the World Bank's Doing Business[17] report, above Germany, Ireland, and Austria. Denmark is the only member of the EU to rank higher. If Britain can continue to attract FDI and see it invested wisely in profitable and scalable sectors, there could be a winning formula on hand for greater growth outside the EU. Even if you have Brexit exhaustion, you need to read Eurizon SLJ Capital's[18] analysis - it is incisive and comprehensive and deserves to be a white paper floating onto the desks of leaders across Europe to drive forward some more functional politics. Does Theresa May have the balls? Britain has its destiny in its own hands. It needs a bold government to make some bold decisions, but otherwise, all the ingredients are there for success.So Much Volatility, So Hard To FindPicking up pennies in front of steamrollers Volatility is an oft-used measure to gauge risk in financial markets. This week we explore a few facets of volatility; and we ask why, with so much uncertainty in the world, is volatility so low? Jawad Mian's Stray Reflections[19] this week explores the correlation between the VIX and the Global Risk Index.What is Volatility Telling US?VIX vs Geopolitical Risk Index (rhs)Source: Bloomberg, Federal Reserve Board, Goldman SachsIs VIX is a poor measure of risk?Despite rising geopolitical risks and lofty market valuations, the VIX Index has been recording new consecutive lows. In the past two decades the VIX has closed below 10 on only 11 occasions, and 7 of those occasions have been during the past month. Jawad rightly asks, 'Are we going to see policy uncertainty decline and volatility stay lower for longer, or are we about to enter a higher volatility regime?'Volatility tourists?JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic sees the death of the human investor[20] as one of the key drivers of declining volatility. Only 10% of trading volume is currently derived from fundamental discretionary trades. Quant strategies and ETF algorithms are accounting for most of the trading, and their setup represses volatility. This happens because many of the quant strategies follow the same big-data and trend-following factor-based approaches. Volatility has been trending so low that yield-seeking 'volatility tourists'[21] are joining in the party, seeing the low VIX readings as a chance to gain some yield in an apparently benign macro environment.Show me the volatility!To put it another way, it is quite possible that the sheer weight of money currently flowing into short volatility positions, the implied central bank put, and the rise of passive investing and quantitative funds may be clipping potential volatility. Taking a different slant on our recent featured piece from 720 Global[22], these forces are making the graph on the left look more like the one on the right;Source: 720 Global What that means is that the volatility of actual returns is increasingly resembling a random walk!OK, I sort of get it - but what's the big deal about volatility?Here we must cede to a master class from Chris Cole of Artemis Capital, whose 'Volatility and the Allegory of the Prisoner's Dilemma'[23] is truly a piece of essential reading for any investor. If you want to get a handle on this crucial concept, you need to watch Chris's Realvision TV[24] interview. One of his key mantras is this: 'Risk cannot be destroyed; it can only be shifted through time and redistributed in form.'Currently, suppressed volatility is merely storing up risk for the future, explosively; and the principal reason for this is that market participants believe central banks will be there to backstop any future random events that would otherwise cause significant stress in the market. Of course, this unwavering belief invites moral hazard and is driving the trade in shorting volatility. Central banks are in effect driving up the occurrence of apparently 'everyday' events and pushing out tail risk:Source: Artemis Capital, Bloomberg The key takeaway here for investors comes when Chris says, 'Peace is not the absence of conflict.' A simple way of thinking about this is that the active conflict between bulls and bears discovering prices in the market each day is for now being drowned out by the waterfall of cheap money pouring down from central banks. But the bulls and bears are still there - waiting.Here's the bottom line.When a risk event occurs that a central bank can't or won't step into, the volatility tourists are likely to be ruined, and the markets will be primed to for severe dislocations in pricing - something which the quants and algos aren't programmed to navigate.Staying AheadThere isn't time each week to discuss everything that is going on in markets. Here we piggyback on previous RVP Weekly Hack talking points and let you to explore some stories further.Who hit the bid? The SNB did.[25]If you need a sign of the times, check out the breakdown on the NASDAQ holdings of the Swiss National Bank. As the SNB fights to reinvest its vast foreign exchange reserves, it has become a large buyer of US tech stocks. In fact it now owns 3.75% of Apple and 3% of Amazon! In the first quarter the SNB increased their holdings of US equities across the board by ~25% - hardly selective buying. It seems some central banks are in fact propping up the markets in quite a direct fashion. When we think about the meteoric growth of passive investing, we need to consider that ETFs may not be the only price-insensitive buyers - there are institutional ones, too.Tech companies make ripe pickings.[26]Are US regulators now looking to initiate trust-busting moves against the big tech companies? With the likes of Amazon and Google becoming increasingly dominant in their chosen fields - and choosing new fields every week - the motivation and incentives to increase regulation of these sectors is obvious. There is a geopolitical angle here. In the period following the GFC, the US extracted a number of fines from European banks that needed to shore up their finances, whilst the EU engaged in various trust-busting activities against the likes of Facebook and Microsoft. Think of this as a kind of modern resource nationalism. Are the US regulators about to turn on their own?

Martin Summary[2] via publisher (Harvard U. Press) Growth in the economic prosperity of the average American family has slowed to a crawl, while the wealth of the richest Americans has skyrocketed. This imbalance threatens the American democratic capitalist system and our way of life. In this bracing yet constructive book, world-renowned business thinker Roger Martin starkly outlines the fundamental problem: We have treated the economy as a machine, pursuing ever-greater efficiency as an inherent good. But efficiency has become too much of a good thing.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984879979/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=1984879979&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=d913d9086c0b0b33d18b61c0396c80be\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984879979/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=1984879979&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=d913d9086c0b0b33d18b61c0396c80be\u25cf</url> Big Dirty Money: The Shocking Injustice and Unseen Cost of White Collar Crime[3] Jennifer Taub Review[4] via San Francisco Chronicle 'White collar crime, like cancer or influenza, comes in many forms,' legal scholar Jennifer Taub writes in her blood-boiling new book, 'Big Dirty Money,' where she examines white-collar crime in America and the ensemble of forces that enable it. Since these frauds profit by deception rather than violence, they are often considered 'victimless crimes.' Not so. As Taub eloquently sketches, the victims are 'the elderly couple who loses life savings to a Ponzi scheme. Hurricane victims who suffer twice when housed in toxic-gas-emitting trailers.

To combat these onslaughts, people everywhere \u2014 rich and not so rich, in business and in their personal lives \u2014 are turning away from traditional police, lawyers, and government regulators toward a new champion: the private investigator. As a private investigator, Tyler Maroney has traveled the globe, overseeing sensitive investigations and untying complicated cases for a wide array of clients. In his new book, he shows that it's private eyes who today are being called upon to catch corrupt politicians, track down international embezzlers, and mine reams of data to reveal which CEOs are lying. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019026070X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=019026070X&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=d87b832265fbbaae188fd13098862210\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019026070X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=019026070X&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=d87b832265fbbaae188fd13098862210\u25cf</url> Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act[7] Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr Summary[8] via publisher (Oxford U. Press) In Taming the Megabanks, Arthur Wilmarth argues that we must again separate banks from securities markets to avoid another devastating financial crisis and ensure that our financial system serves Main Street business firms and consumers instead of Wall Street bankers and speculators. Wilmarth's comprehensive and detailed analysis demonstrates that a new Glass-Steagall Act would make our financial system much more stable and less likely to produce boom-and-bust cycles. Giant universal banks would no longer dominate our financial system or receive enormous subsidies. A more decentralized and competitive financial system would encourage banks and securities firms to fulfill their proper roles as servants - not masters - of Main Street businesses and consumers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/125024062X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=125024062X&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=e2b00b8ff3a89ee998597bc30307049f\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/125024062X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#38;camp=1789&amp;#38;creative=9325&amp;#38;creativeASIN=125024062X&amp;#38;linkCode=as2&amp;#38;tag=thecapitalspe-20&amp;#38;linkId=e2b00b8ff3a89ee998597bc30307049f\u25cf</url> Liberty from All Masters: The New American Autocracy vs. the Will of the People[9] Barry C. Lynn Review[10]via Washington Monthly Barry C. Lynn, author and executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an antitrust advocacy group, has been sounding the alarm about monopolies for years. In his new book, Liberty from All Masters, he insists that monopolies are ultimately a political problem. As surely as Americans are citizens in a democracy, they are citizens in a political economy. But with their far-reaching and subtle powers, monopolies undermine our agency in the economic sphere of life. Indirectly, they threaten democratic self-governance, too. \u25cf Trampled by Unicorns: Big Tech's Empathy Problem and How to Fix It[11] Malle Gavet Interview[12] with author via Bloomberg Malle Gavet, Former COO at Compass, discusses her new book 'Trampled by Unicorns: Big Tech's Empathy Problem and How to Fix It.' She talks about why it's important for business leaders to care about the impact their companies have on the world. \u25cf Out of the Ether: The Amazing Story of Ethereum and the $55 Million Heist that Almost Destroyed It All[13] Matthew Leising Excerpt[14] via Coindesk Bloomberg News reporter Mathew Leising's new book, 'Out of the Ether: The Amazing Story of Ethereum and the $55 Million Heist That Almost Destroyed It All', tells the story of the infamous DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] hack that almost brought down the world's second-largest blockchain.

Other negatives in the system, writes the author, are time-sensitive algorithms whose speed divorces prices from 'reality' and a corporate culture that turns the financial-sector worker into 'merely a cog in a global delivery mechanism.' The author's exercise in forensic accounting as he examines a case of government bankruptcy is particularly fascinating.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802128475/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=0802128475...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=e93933ada84bd7805c81917017365fc6\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802128475/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=0802128475...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=e93933ada84bd7805c81917017365fc6\u25cf</url> The Finance Curse: How Global Finance is Making Us All Poorer[3]By Nicholas ShaxsonReview[4] via London School of Economics and Political ScienceFor Nicholas Shaxson there is a deep curse shaped by modern finance which needs to be understood and effectively repelled to save society and our ecosystem. The ingredients of this curse include powerful elites, complex financial markets and institutions, extreme greed and capitalism, the economics and finance academy and its theories as well as false narratives like 'competitiveness' and 'light-touch regulation' as a social good and banking or financial markets as job and wealth creators. Making shareholders the primary focus of corporations and capital markets leads to deep distortions in the measurement of business performance and the culture of its people and services. Shaxson challenges the fundamental notion of 'investment' in modern finance, showing that what is really happening under its guise is the extraction of wealth, rather than its replenishment or wider distribution.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKPVFRT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=B07NKPVFRT...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=f22d13efc5c5da82a8e44ee04c41b4f6\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKPVFRT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=B07NKPVFRT...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=f22d13efc5c5da82a8e44ee04c41b4f6\u25cf</url> Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles \u2014 and All of Us[5]By Rana ForooharSummary[6] via publisher (Currency/Penguin)A penetrating indictment of how today's largest tech companies are hijacking our data, our livelihoods, our social fabric, and our minds\u2014from an acclaimed Financial Times columnist and CNN analyst. 'Don't be evil' was enshrined as Google's original corporate mantra back in its early days, when the company's cheerful logo still conveyed the utopian vision for a future in which technology would inevitably make the world better, safer, and more prosperous. Unfortunately, it's been quite a while since Google, or the majority of the Big Tech companies, lived up to this founding philosophy. Today, the utopia they sought to create is looking more dystopian than ever: from digital surveillance and the loss of privacy to the spreading of misinformation and hate speech to predatory algorithms targeting the weak and vulnerable to products that have been engineered to manipulate our desires. \u25cf Loserthink: How Untrained Brains Are Ruining America[7]By Scott AdamsSummary[8] via publisher (Portfolio/Penguin)From the creator of Dilbert and author of Win Bigly, a guide to spotting and avoiding loserthink: sneaky mental habits trapping victims in their own bubbles of reality. If you've been on social media lately, or turned on your TV, you may have noticed a lot of dumb ideas floating around. If we're not careful, loserthink would have us believe that every Trump supporter is a bigoted racist, addicts should be responsible for fixing the opioid epidemic, and that your relationship fell apart simply because you chewed with your mouth open. \u25cf Meeting Globalization's Challenges: Policies to Make Trade Work for All[9]By Lus Cato and Maurice ObstfeldSummary[10] via publisher (Princeton University Press)Globalization has expanded economic opportunities throughout the world, but it has also left many people feeling dispossessed, disenfranchised, and angry. Lus Cato and Maurice Obstfeld bring together some of today's top economists to assess the benefits, costs, and daunting policy challenges of globalization. This timely and accessible book combines incisive analyses of the anatomy of globalization with innovative and practical policy ideas that can help to make it work better for everyone.

For most people, it's difficult to say 'I'm not sure' in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.\u25cf How to Fix the Future[3] By Andrew Keen Review[4] via Fortune Something has gone wrong with the Internet. </p><p>Once billed as a tool for building community, the web has devolved into an ungovernable swamp of hate, surveillance, and distraction. Andrew Keen, an author and tech entrepreneur, is hardly the first to point this out, but his ambitious new book, How to Fix the Future, makes what might be the most forceful case yet. A sweeping account of Big Tech's growing takeover of our lives, the book examines everything from Silicon Valley monopolies to the sinister social media monitoring of the Chinese government. It shows why, if given the chance, we'd never build the Internet we have now: As a centralized advertising economy that strips wealth from creators, and feeds personal data to giant corporations. Keen's account grows darker as he recounts how an explosion in artificial intelligence could soon snuff out humanity. \u25cf Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley[5] By Emily Chang Summary[6] via publisher (Penguin Random House) Silicon Valley is a modern utopia where anyone can change the world. Unless you're a woman. For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops, where millions of dollars grow on trees. It's a 'Brotopia,' where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties. \u25cf The New Wealth of Nations[7] Summary[8] via publisher (Simon ...huster) The emerging world was poor and illiterate just forty years ago. Today, over 70 per cent of the world's middle class resides in the erstwhile poor countries; world income inequality is down to levels last observed in 1870; and there has been a large reduction in absolute poverty. What accounts for such rapid development and catch-up? Distinguished economist Surjit S. Bhalla's The New Wealth of Nations offers a short answer\u2014the spread of education. The very large increase in college graduates in the non-Western world, the growing educational achievements of women, and the radical change in gender roles is critical to the understanding of current-day mega-trends. Indeed, this unprecedented development\u2014which creates competition globally and lowers employment costs\u2014is also why world inflation has been low, and declining, for nearly twenty years. \u25cf Expert Failure[9] By Roger Koppl Summary[10] via publisher (Cambridge University Press) The humble idea that experts are ordinary human beings leads to surprising conclusions about how to get the best possible expert advice. All too often, experts have monopoly power because of licensing restrictions or because they are government bureaucrats protected from both competition and the consequences of their decisions. This book argues that, in the market for expert opinion, we need real competition in which rival experts may have different opinions and new experts are free to enter. But the idea of breaking up expert monopolies has far-reaching implications for public administration, forensic science, research science, economics, America's military-industrial complex, and all domains of expert knowledge. Roger Koppl develops a theory of experts and expert failure, and uses a wide range of examples - from forensic science to fashion - to explain the applications of his theory, including state regulation of economic activity. \u25cf American Capitalism: New Histories[11] Edited by Sven Beckert and Christine Desan Summary[12] via publisher (Columbia University Press) The United States has long epitomized capitalism. From its enterprising shopkeepers, wildcat banks, violent slave plantations, huge industrial working class, and raucous commodities trade to its world-spanning multinationals, its massive factories, and the centripetal power of New York in the world of finance, America has come to symbolize capitalism for two centuries and more. But an understanding of the history of American capitalism is as elusive as it is urgent. What does it mean to make capitalism a subject of historical inquiry? What is its potential across multiple disciplines, alongside different methodologies, and in a range of geographic and chronological settings? And how does a focus on capitalism change our understanding of American history? \u25cf Broken Pie Chart: 5 Ways to Build Your Investment Portfolio to Withstand and Prosper in Risky Markets[13] By Derek Moore Summary[14] via publisher (Emerald Publishing) Investment outcomes and strategies have changed considerably since 2008. Broken Pie Chart demonstrates the failures of classical diversification and asset allocation, pointing out that the backward-looking methods used by traditional financial professionals will not work moving forward. Derek Moore explains why traditional risk-spreading leads to losses during sell-off periods, and contains risks that many investors do not recognize until it is too late. He also reflects on the changes in the financial market since the global financial crisis, and how these changes may affect your asset allocation and risk management decision-making in a landscape of lower rates and higher risks.

Given the stakes, it's surprising how few comparative studies exist of taxation of the rich over the long run. Many people have asked this question only for recent decades, or for a single country. </p><p>The last book to treat the question extensively was published more than a century ago, by Edwin Seligman.\u25cf People Get Ready: The Fight Against a Jobless Economy and a Citizenless Democracy[3] By Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols Review[4] via Pubishers Weekly In a stirring call to arms, McChesney (Blowing the Roof off the Twenty-First Century) and Nichols (The S Word) argue that although the digital revolution has been world-shaking and ruthlessly efficient, it has fallen short of ushering in the utopia some have predicted, because the ability to determine the future has been concentrated among just a few powerful people. Global automation and dislocation\u2014the result of which is that a tiny fraction of the workforce once needed can now complete the same amount of work\u2014will soon lead to unemployment of a startling magnitude. No one has a plan to resolve this looming so-called jobless economy, not even the big tech companies that helped create the situation. Moreover, the authors find that historically, the U.S. government does not take action until faced with catastrophe. McChesney and Nichols warn of a 'citizen- less democracy,' in which politicians pander only to the needs of a few wealthy donors, leaving the majority in the dust and excluding them from the process of worldbuilding. \u25cf The Institutional ETF Toolbox: How Institutions Can Understand and Utilize the Fast-Growing World of ETFs[5] By Eric Balchunas Summary[6] via publisher (Wiley/Bloomberg) The Institutional ETF Toolbox is the institutional investor's guide to utilizing exchange-traded funds and taking full advantage of the innovative new products in their expanding repertoire. The ETF toolbox is expanding rapidly with nearly one new ETF launching every day this decade so far. As with any financial innovation, this phenomenon brings both opportunity and concerns, as well as a dire need for clarity and strong due diligence skills. This book is both reference and resource, providing data-driven explanations backed by real-world market examples\u2014alongside valuable insight from leading practitioners. Coverage includes an examination of the advantages and growth of ETFs as well as current and future uses of ETFs, emerging markets, and the strategic and tactical perspectives you need to effectively use ETFs to optimal effect. The major concerns surrounding ETFs are addressed in full to give you the background you need to formulate a better ETF strategy. \u25cf The Money Problem: Rethinking Financial Regulation[7] By Morgan Ricks Summary[8] via publisher (University of Chicago Press) Years have passed since the world experienced one of the worst financial crises in history, and while countless experts have analyzed it, many central questions remain unanswered. Should money creation be considered a 'public' or 'private' activity\u2014or both? What do we mean by, and want from, financial stability? What role should regulation play? How would we design our monetary institutions if we could start from scratch? In The Money Problem, Morgan Ricks addresses all of these questions and more, offering a practical yet elegant blueprint for a modernized system of money and banking\u2014one that, crucially, can be accomplished through incremental changes to the United States' current system. He brings a critical, missing dimension to the ongoing debates over financial stability policy, arguing that the issue is primarily one of monetary system design. \u25cf What's Wrong with Money: The Biggest Bubble of All[9] By Michael Ashton Summary[10] via publisher (Wiley) What's Wrong with Money? explores how and why money is valued and the warning signs that point to its eventual collapse. Author Michael Ashton is widely regarded as a premier expert on inflation, and in this book, he illustrates how the erosion of trust in central banks is putting us at high risk of both near- and long-term inflation\u2014and a potentially very serious disruption. It's not about a conspiracy surrounding inflation reporting; it's about the tentative agreement we all carry that lends money its value. This value isn't necessarily inherent; while some currency is backed by stored value, others are not. This book walks you through the history of currency and details the ways in which it can fall apart. You'll learn how to invest in any type of collapse scenario, and you'll gain expert insight into the warning signs that signal a coming shock to the financial system.

Rivaling nation states in power and capital, today's net states are reaching into our physical world, inserting digital services into our lived environments in ways both unseen and, at times, unknown to us.

AhmedSummary[4] via publisher (Cambridge U. Press)Can foreign capital empower dictatorship? This groundbreaking book develops a unified theory that links three prominent forms of international capital to the endurance of dictatorships. International capital empowers governments to finance two key instruments of non-democratic politics: repression and patronage. The Perils of International Capital uses theory, case studies, and cross-national statistical evidence to demonstrate causal effects between foreign capital and authoritarian politics. These finding are crucial to scholars and policymakers alike, as they call for a recalibration of the welfare effects associated with greater financial globalization. Ahmed reveals that, while foreign capital may improve economic development, it can tragically hinder democratic governance in the process.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1509536027/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=1509536027...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=e6844b8056fa843537b496c95c0a0429\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1509536027/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=1509536027...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=e6844b8056fa843537b496c95c0a0429\u25cf</url> The Uncounted[5]By Alex CobhamSummary[6] via publisher (Polity Books)What we count matters - and in a world where policies and decisions are underpinned by numbers, statistics and data, if you're not counted, you don't count. Alex Cobham argues that systematic gaps in economic and demographic data not only lead us to understate a wide range of damaging inequalities, but also to actively exacerbate them. He shows how, in statistics ranging from electoral registers to household surveys and census data, people from disadvantaged groups, such as indigenous populations, women, and disabled people, are consistently underrepresented. This further marginalizes them, reducing everything from their political power to their weight in public spending decisions. Meanwhile, corporations and the ultra-rich seek ever greater complexity and opacity in their financial affairs - and when their wealth goes untallied, it means they can avoid regulation and taxation. \u25cf Economists at War: How a Handful of Economists Helped Win and Lose the World Wars[7]By Alan BollardSummary[8] via publisher (Oxford University Press)Economists at War tells the story of a group of remarkable economists, and how they used their skills to help their countries fight their battles during the turbulent period covering the Chinese-Japanese War, World War I, and the Cold War. Politicians and generals cannot win wars if they do not have resources. This book focuses on the lives and achievements of seven finance ministers, advisors, and central bankers from Japan, China, Germany, the UK, the USSR, and the US. They all had connections, and their stories are interlinked. 1935-55 was a time of conflict, confrontation and destruction. It was also the time when the skills of economists were called upon to finance the military, to identify economic vulnerabilities, to help reconstruction. Economics was first used as a policy tool, and economists started to gain importance: macroeconomics, managerial economics, and computing were all born during this time. \u25cf Private Capital Investing: The Handbook of Private Debt and Private Equity[9]By Roberto IppolitoSummary[10] via publisher (Wiley)Private Capital Investing: The Handbook of Private Debt and Private Equity is a practical manual on investing in the two of the most common alternative asset classes (private equity and private debt) and provides a unique insight on how principal investors analyze investment opportunities. Unlike other textbooks available in the market, Private Capital Investing covers the various phases that principal investors follow when analyzing a private investment opportunity.

Eschewing the thesis that companies like Uber are primarily responsible for people working jobs without proper benefits and protections, Hyman examines the changes in American corporate life after the 1950s and 1960s, and why the much-mythologized postwar years were less rosy than we think. At the same time, he explains that the postwar era did offer protections for workers that have lately become much sparser and posits that the challenge going forward is to ensure that Americans keep the flexibility they now seem to want, while simultaneously not being exploited by the companies they work for. Is this even possible? I recently spoke by phone with Hyman, who is an associate professor of history at the ILR School at Cornell University, to ask.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578206501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=0578206501...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=373399481d82974c45880544d5a022b4\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578206501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=0578206501...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=373399481d82974c45880544d5a022b4\u25cf</url> Buy the Fear, Sell the Greed: 7 Behavioral Quant Strategies for Traders[3] By Larry Connors Summary[4] via publisher (TradingMarkets Publishing) As all professional traders know, the greatest trading edges occur when money managers, investors, and traders panic. They sell-off securities, often-times to extreme levels and after they're done selling, the strong money (the professional money) enters the market and takes prices higher. This behavior creates great trading opportunities for the professionals who know when to buy. And this same behavior has occurred over and over again for decades and will likely do so for years to come because human behavior never changes!       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1640090711/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=1640090711...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=de6f8b695386ff78438bc13b6f9cbdc9\u25cf\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1640090711/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8...p=1789...ative=9325...ativeASIN=1640090711...kCode=as2...=bookscs-20...kId=de6f8b695386ff78438bc13b6f9cbdc9\u25cf</url> Silicon States: The Power and Politics of Big Tech and What It Means for Our Future[5] By Lucie Greene Excerpt[6] via Red Herring Silicon Valley companies have done a good job presenting themselves as friendly, egalitarian democratizers. The projected value system of this group is largely positive. They're pro-LGBT, pro-sustainability, pro-social good. But it's on their own terms, and self-regulated. (Evidenced by their famously hostile work environments, gender inequality, and seeming disinterest in the very real homeless problem in their hometown of San Francisco.) All of this is significant as Big Tech's reach extends. It is one thing if a company monopolizes a service\u2014don't subscribe to it. Or a product\u2014don't buy it. But what happens when that company is providing everything? And all those things are interconnected and controlling the way you live, the loans you get, the insurance you can buy, and the prices you pay for them. When your health data defines whether you get access to credit. When your productivity declines and is connected directly to your salary. The veneer of control quickly vanishes, and you're left with monopoly not just of what you buy, but how you live. It's a consumerist police state. \u25cf The Million-Dollar Financial Advisor Team: Best Practices from Top Performing Teams[7] By David J. Mullen Jr. Summary[8] via Amazon David Mullen, Jr., whose financial advisor program at Merrill Lynch had a success rate twice the industry average, shows advisors how to effectively offer wealth and financial management services under one roof to better service clients. When exacting clients, high expectations, and the need to grow define your job, you need to be at the top of your game. That's why more and more financial advisors are pooling resources to meet demand and joining teams in the process. \u25cf Boom Town: The Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, its Chaotic Founding its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-class Metropolis[9] By Sam Anderson Review[10] via City Journal Oklahoma City is the rare place that emerged in a single day: April 22, 1889, with the legendary Land Run, when the U.S. government opened up unassigned plots (taken from Indian tribes) to white settlement on a first-come, first-served basis. (The 'Sooners' of University of Oklahoma football fame were those who had snuck in early to stake out their claims before everyone else.) Sited at the confluence of a railroad line and a river, Oklahoma City was preselected as an auspicious location for a capital city; settlers could claim only urban-size lots, as opposed to 160-acre rural homesteads. By sunset of Day One of the Land Run, the city had gone from empty prairieland to a bustling metropolis, with about 10,000 people. Before the first well was sunk or building foundation dug, the new town's enterprising citizens had laid out streets and begun organizing local government.

Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, struck a more cautious note than one of his rivals on Sunday when asked about whether the federal government should break up major companies such as Facebook.</p><p>\"I don't care if it's Facebook, the pharma industry, even the agricultural industry. We've had a problem in America with corporate consolidation that is having really ill effects,\" Booker said on ABC News's \"This Week\" with George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>But, Booker added, \"I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say - 'I'm going to break up you guys.'\u00a0\"</p><p>Booker (N.J.) insisted his comments were not meant as criticism of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another Democratic presidential contender, who has called for major tech companies that have grown with mergers, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, to be unraveled with stricter regulations.</p><p>\"She is my friend,\" Booker said. \"Let her discuss and debate her positions.\" </p><p>Still, he said that rather than call for companies to be broken up with a sweeping policy proposal, like Warren offered in March, he would encourage the Justice Department to take the lead and use \"antitrust legislation to do the proper investigations and to hold industries accountable for corporate consolidation.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is also running for president, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that it is time to \"seriously take a look\" at breaking up Facebook, underscoring how the 2020 Democratic field is grappling with this debate.</p><p>\"There's no question in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation and that has not been happening,\" Harris said. \"It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. As far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop.\"</p><p>Booker's remarks came days after Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote in a New York Times opinion piece that Facebook chief executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has enabled the company to grow into a monopoly and sacrificed \"security and civility for clicks.\"</p><p>Warren tweeted last week: \"Chris Hughes is right.\"</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power-over our economy, our society, &amp; our democracy,\" she wrote Thursday. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses &amp; stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\"</p><p>While Booker is liberal, he has established a reputation in the Senate, and during his time as Newark's mayor, as a business-friendly Democrat who engages with tech leaders and woos them to invest in New Jersey, including Zuckerberg.</p><p>Months after Booker won a second mayoral term, Zuckerberg gave $100\u00a0million to Newark's struggling schools and worked closely with Booker on education issues.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.costa@washpost.com\">robert.costa@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a515e8e874c311e9b3f55673edf2d127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3K-V2X1-DXKP-J069-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><timeReceived>2:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 12, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The entrance of former <person><nameText>Vice President Joe Biden </nameText></person>into the race puts added pressure on Booker, especially competing for Black voters \u2014 a major piece of the Democratic constituency in the South, and a group that has largely supported Biden in early polls.</p><p> On the trail, Booker is still campaigning with an ebullient style, recording selfie videos for voters and cracking self-deprecating \"dad jokes\" at every stop. He even broke briefly into song during an interview, singing a few bars of \"My City of Ruins\" by Bruce Springsteen.</p><p> But stuck in the low single digits in both national and early state polls, with a middling small-dollar fundraising operation, he has started to sprinkle his unity-themed stump speech with some slight contrasts to other Democratic candidates.</p><p> \"I'm one of those Democrats to say we need to start doing things that make people's lives better, because Democrats have done things that have made people's lives worse,\" Booker said at a house party in Newton, referring to the 1994 crime bill Biden supported while he was in the Senate, and which experts say contributed to mass incarceration.</p><p> And in calls for party solidarity, he offered a veiled critique of the hesitance of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to endorse <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in 2016.</p><p> \"I hope that one of the questions you ask every single candidate is, if you're not the person, that you will commit to us that you will double down and support the person who is the nominee,\" Booker told the crowd in Newton. \"I saw that movie in 2016. I don't want to relive it.\"</p><p> Though he claims to try to avoid direct attacks on Trump \u2014 \"The more attention we give him, the more oxygen he takes,\" Booker said \u2014 he has increased his criticisms, including taking a generational swipe at him as he looked ahead to the stakes of the climate change fight \"20 years from now, when I'm the age of this current president.\"</p><p> To hear Booker describe it, he is \"pumped\" about his campaign's status, a slow-but-steady strategy espoused by the \"Brick by Brick\" slogan seen on signs at a town hall-style event in Burlington on Saturday and on his campaign social media accounts.</p><p> \"I think if you look at the fundamentals of what has won past competitive Iowa primaries, we are doing extraordinarily well,\" Booker said in an interview. \"The folks who know the politics in the state will unequivocally tell you we have the best organization on the ground.\"</p><p> While supporters in Iowa are confident in his message, some are perplexed at his stagnant polling.</p><p> \"I don't know if it is because the message of love, and some people don't necessarily connect to that,\" said Rachelle Chase, 55, from Ottumwa, who has written two books about the Buxton coal mines, where Booker's great-great-grandparents worked. \"But I think what appeals to me is that he's being authentic.\"</p><p> His focus on Iowa, with 30 events held as of Sunday and a staff of 50 in the state, and his pledge to unveil a \"Marshall Plan\" for rural America could help him build momentum.</p><p> \"These are areas that have experienced a lot of difficult economic times,\" said Rep. Dave Loebsack, who accompanied Booker on Saturday and represents an Iowa district Trump won in 2016. \"I think just listening to them and talking to them along economic lines is the most important thing candidates can do.\"</p><p> Booker made a splash nationally with his sweeping gun reform policy, and earned kudos from many voters this weekend for his vocal response to the wave of new state bills restricting abortion. And he teased thoughts on regulating social media companies, taking direct aim at criticisms that he has been too cozy with big tech.</p><p> \"I think that having better control of your own data and information is really important, and restricting the ability of platforms to be able to use your data for their profit,\" Booker said in an interview. \"This is a space where we need to regulate, and having more transparency in that area is something we need to regulate.\"</p><p> Booker's flatlining in the national polls has not helped an already struggling small-dollar fundraising network; just 16% of his donations in the first three months of the year were $200 or less. Instead, Booker has kept a steady pace of high-dollar fundraising events, and his campaign has roughly two dozen fundraisers across six states on the books for the next month.</p><p> Though he pledged in an interview to release the names of his bundlers \u2014 supporters who gather donations from friends and business associates \u2014 he said he would not allow pooled news media coverage of his fundraisers as Biden has.</p><p> Booker did get one small-dollar boost Saturday. While touring the flood damage in downtown Muscatine, Booker was stopped by two local farmers, Garry and Carolyn Reid. They farm 20,000 bushels of corn and soybeans per year, and said they had lost 85 cents per bushel as a result of Trump's trade war.</p><p> Since then, Garry Reid said, the federal government deposited $200 into their bank account from an emergency fund. So Reid, 83, took $25 from that and donated it to Booker's campaign.</p><p> \"You have no idea how much this encourages me,\" Booker said.</p><p> \"Well,\" Reid replied, tugging on his suspenders and offering a smirk, \"it's going to take more than that.\" \u2014 (The New York Times)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-aca3362d6e4ef9e07897aad61f94cce6146ec951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899D9772552F0 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W78-N501-JBCN-4136-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Philadelphia Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Mahaney</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Lead Internet Research Analyst</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presentation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY, MD &amp; LEAD INTERNET RESEARCH ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: All right. I'm Mark Mahaney, Director of Internet Research at RBC. Glenn Fogel, the CEO of Booking Holdings, is with us. We've got 30 minutes. I'm going to ask questions for 28 of those, and then we'll open it up for Q&amp;A. Glenn, thanks a ton for coming here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Here's the question I want to start off with. You've been able to maintain 11% roughly room night growth this year. I think this has been not an optimal year for global travel. And I try to remind people like Booking is really a global travel company. The percentage of your travel that's cross-border, it's those Europeans. There's some in the audience who like to travel everywhere around the world, [Vernon] is one, and people in China traveling. And there's been a series of conditions, whether it's currency, political disturbances or whatever, that have made this kind of a subpar year, and my reaction to all that is, well, if Booking can sustain 11% room night growth in this environment, it's not terrible, but it's not great, that should give us confidence in the ability for the company to sustain high single-digit, low double-digit room night growth for the next couple of years. Your thoughts?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, BOOKING HOLDINGS INC.: Well, my thought is we don't give out any sort of numerical forecasts beyond our current quarter. So I will say this, though. Look, travel is a great industry. It has weathered storms forever. And it will continue. There'll be years that are better than other years without doubt. But the fact is it will continue in the long run to grow faster than GDP. And the part of the business that we're in, which is the digital commerce way, we should do a little bit better than that. So I am absolutely long-term bullish on our industry, which is a great industry to be in.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: How about taking a shot at the question of whether -- has this been a good environment for Booking and global travel this year? On a scale of 1 to 10, would you call this a 10, a 6?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: We made some very good moves during the year. I have seen some progress I really like, helping to get our long-term goal that I've talked about, this thing we call the connected trip. I'm pretty pleased about some of the things that we've rolled out. I like the fact that we now have a flights product up that we never had before really for Booking.com, and at the same time, we have it up in Agoda. So that's a good thing.</p><p>I like the fact that something that while it's a very small thing, but it shows that when we say we're going to do something, we do it. So for example, it's over a year ago, we invested money into a company called Grab. And I explained why we are making that investment. I talked about the idea that a customer for Booking.com, when they showed up in an Asia country and they've gotten off the airport and they're saying, \"Okay, how do I -- how am I going to get around?\" And we wanted to produce a way using the Booking.com app that a person could instantly get a ridesharing service without having to download a new app they never heard of, they didn't have to put their credit card in, that would just be seamless, holistic, frictionless way. And now we're doing it. It now is up and running. The Grab app, it's on the Booking.com app. And you don't see Grab, it just looks like Booking.com. You land in Singapore, you get out, you pull up your Booking.com app and you can get a ride straight up. That to me is the progress. So I'm very pleased with what we've done.</p><p>In terms of the macro world, look, there's going to be, as I said, ups, downs, ups, downs. We'll be fine.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about the connected trip then and maybe talk about why -- I don't know, it's not why now, but it's relatively why recently, you've started to emphasize the connected trip. And air overseas was something that would never -- well, we never saw before until this year. So why the focus on it now? Like that's the timing question. And then how many different pieces do you have to put together to really create the connected trip?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So the reason that we have built out the flight product and are continuing to build it out, it's a very early stage. We literally just released it out in Europe a few weeks ago and only for a few countries. The reason it's so important is a lot of people like to start their travel planning with a flight. So we want to capture those people right at the beginning, one. Two, if you want to create this connected trip that makes it so much easier, you've got to do all parts of it. If there's any break in that product, then it's not a holistic, seamless way. So for example, and I've talked about this a bit in the past about if you have a flight and something goes wrong in that flight, well, the problems are going to cascade through the rest of the trip if your flight is canceled or delayed. If we have that flight information, we've done that flight, we can then correct every single other part of that trip and fix it for the person. It makes it so much better.</p><p>And I've seen it done. I've seen it done, but it's done manually, and it's done by the traveler, and it's a pain. If you ever had a flight you had to change and then you have to change the pickup at the airport. Then you had to change your restaurant reservation because you're not going to land in time to actually make that business dinner that you were planning to make. Those things that we can do ourselves in the future in this connected trip seamlessly, frictionlessly, now create a much better experience that will build the loyalty, that will have people come back to us direct. That's the win.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: You're 2x larger in terms of hotel room nights sold than -- well, at least versus Expedia. And they've been offering a package of services for a long time. They've been offering a \"connected trip\" for a long time. So my take on that is connected trip is -- it sounds like a nice opportunity for you, but it's probably not a huge incremental opportunity for you.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: I think it's a game changer if it's done the right way. And what you've talked about, Expedia, Expedia has offered many different products in what is seen more as a cross-sell type event. There's no personalization, the way I want to do it. Look, when I go to London and I stay using Booking.com in Mayfair on my own dime because it's really expensive hotels there, when I do that, I want to get offers from restaurants in Mayfair from OpenTable, which we own. Currently, we don't have that set up yet. But absolutely, that personalization to be -- if I'm staying at Claridge's, I should be getting really expensive restaurant offers to me, similarly the different type of ground transportation.</p><p>So the personalization is a critical part of the connected trip along with the customer service and giving the opportunity to the merchant -- for the suppliers to merchandise what they have. Those restaurants in Mayfair is a simple example. They want to get my money. They want me to go there. So we have this platform in the future that enables them. Maybe I get a reduced price for a cabernet, maybe just let me know, there's a great cabernet that I would love to come to their restaurant. That's the thing. By creating this absolutely overarching platform that enables both sides to know more about each other, that's the opportunity.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: It sounds like a great opportunity, but like how long does that take to put together? I know you -- if you're just launching this, is this going to take years to really create a personalized connected trip?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: It will take years to have the perfect of everything, but we're already seeing it. We -- I was at -- in London with a bunch of investors, and it was a great story because we're talking about this. And the person, the investor, told us, \"It was just wonderful. So yes, I see it happening because I booked with Booking.com and I had a family,\" and I think it's a family of 6 or 5 or whatever, \"and you guys offered me this really discounted people mover, a van, a minivan. And it was like perfectly over that one up because you must have known how many people we have.\" But -- and the guy said, \"But I didn't trust the price. So I checked around, and the price was much lower than anything else.\" To me, that was a perfect example of that working.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. That sounds good. All right. But it's still going to take you a while, I guess, to put it together perfectly.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Well, it's never going to be done. Let me -- let's not be foolish about this, guys. Technology changes all the time. There'll be new things that will come down the way that we need to work and invest on and create -- and new things I haven't even thought of yet that will happen. But because we're the biggest, because we have incredible technology, because we have scale, we can afford more than anybody else in the industry to work on these issues, to solve these problems, to bring it out, bring it to fruition faster than anybody else and better than anybody else. We can afford to have a center in Tel Aviv that has some incredible AI genius-type machine learning gurus who are out there doing this personalization. We've got a bunch of -- it's a whole center there, okay? How many people can afford that? Not a lot. And I can go on and on and on of why scale wins.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. I think part of the connected trip is going to be the local attractions, and that's been kind of an area of investment and build-out for the last several years. Just talk about how well that's doing so far, the traction you're seeing, building out the local attraction.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: It's early. It's very, very early. It's a very fragmented market. We bought a company called FareHarbor that helps in the very long tail area of attractions. It's something that's going to take a lot of time because of the fragmentation, the connectivity for that. But again, once you get that out and you start getting all the stuff flowing and learning about what people want to buy and create that personalization and offer those, whether it be the smallest player who's offering a scuba trip to some of the large players that are big tours, being able to offer to them an opportunity for them to sell what they want to sell to our incredible demand platform, the largest demand platform for travel, that's a great advantage.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. And can you disclose anything about the attach rates you're seeing? And do those -- are those normally add-on sales? Or do you actually have people coming to Booking just for the attractions?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So currently, we have had some people. And we've been experimenting with people buying on their own stuff, but it's primarily -- this is a way for people who've already booked. That being said, it's very, very early. We don't give away any attachment rates. But I will say that this is something I expect to increase substantially over time as we build it out, as we have become more familiar with it.</p><p>But, and this is really the important thing, as you know, the amounts that we're talking about are smaller than the hotel industry. So in terms of what it will add in terms of benefit to the bottom line when you compare the hotel vertical in terms it's going to be a relatively smaller part. But by adding that value that the person feels that when they go to Booking.com, they get that so much easier. When they're in destination on that app and they're getting the notification, oh, look, I can do that -- and I've given that example. I gave that example last year, if you recall, the one about Salzburg. I'm going to give it again. So for anybody who has heard it, you can do your e-mails.</p><p>But I was in Salzburg with my family, and my wife had done the booking with Booking.com for the hotel, and we are in the center of Salzburg. And on the app came a notification of, \"Oh, don't forget the things you can do in Salzburg.\" And my wife pulled it out right there and looked at it, and she looked, \"Oh, look, we're right where the funicular that goes up to the castle is. Let's do that.\" And I said, \"Great.\" One press, one press gets the QR code, comes up right away. We look, \"Okay, what do we do next?\" There are all these cashiers and there are all these lines for people to pay for the ticket to go up the funicular to the castle. There was one cashier had a sign said Booking.com, no line. We go in there. My wife shows the QR code, no problem, up we go, everybody else pulling out their euros, pulling out their credit cards. We're up, and it costs less because we negotiated a deal, so ours was less than everybody else's. That's the win.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: The hills are alive?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Definitely. Well, no, no, I didn't hear that, but yes.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: That's the place. All right. I know you read all of our research. We called out 2 themes from the last quarter. One was the Google squeeze, and the other one is just rising regulatory scrutiny. So on the Google squeeze, you didn't call it out, but 2 other companies did, Expedia and TripAdvisor, that we call it -- not the Google squeeze, so there's no more Google free lunch. And so the companies that were dependent on Google SEO for traffic aren't getting as much traffic because SEO has been pushed down. Just talk about your dependency on Google SEO on organic search and just talk about your overall marketing mix and how that's needed to change over the last couple of years.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So we said on the call that it's a small channel for us. I said, yes, we saw some headwinds, a small channel for us. In terms of mix, so we built this company, really built the company on pay-for-performance marketing, and it's no secret that we did it with Google. And Google and us had a very good relationship together. We both benefited tremendously. We continue to look, though -- it's got a song going on.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Sorry.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So we know, though, in the long run, though, we want people to come to us direct -- I can wait.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: It's Mark Okerstrom.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Oh, okay.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Sorry, go ahead.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: That wasn't very nice. So we know that we want people to come direct, and there's lots of things. First thing is get the person in whatever way we can and convert them to come direct by giving them great service, by giving them great value and make sure we have the greatest breadth of different things that they could stay at, all the things that creates a better way for people to do travel.</p><p>And we -- now we do brand marketing. If you recall, a long time ago, we did no brand marketing at Booking.com. We've built that out, and we continue to build it, pulled it back a little bit. One of the things I said when I first became CEO of Booking Holdings is I mentioned how we're going to have brand marketing, and it's an important part, but I also made it very clear that we weren't going to waste money, that we're going to do it scientifically as much as possible. We're going to experiment. And if things don't work, we'll pull back and try again. So we're going to continue to do that. Brand marketing is important. Pay-for-performance is marketing -- is important. All these elements are important. But the best thing is provide a better service. That's the winner.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Do you think you've been able to diversify the marketing channels as efficiently as you would like? I know it's a long path. I know one of the ways that we can tell, and one of the ways you ask us to judge you is percentage of your traffic that's direct. You've now said it's over 50%. My guess is that that's kind of glacially moving up. Is there any reason to think that you could -- is there anything you can do to accelerate it up? My guess is that you just -- it's hard to get channels that are as efficient as Google paid search. Social just hasn't really worked. There's no commercial intent there. Just comment on the ability to diversify away from Google paid search. And how much higher and how long is it going to take you to go from over 50% to 75% of traffic being direct?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So let me -- so I don't forget. You mentioned social, and we've talked about this in the past. Social is harder for the travel industry, it seems. Obviously, somebody must be doing very well with social because companies like Facebook are seeing revenue growing very substantially. So there are people who are paying a lot of money for social. We continue to work on that. We continue to work with Facebook and all the social platforms to figure out what's the best way because we would love to provide money to launch different platforms, give them any -- we'll give you all the money in the world if we have a good ROI. So we're going to continue to work on that, absolutely.</p><p>In terms of rate that direct will move up, I'm not going to talk much about what the rate is. But clearly, I'll just re-emphasize when I say how important that is to us, our belief is that that is the goal that's most important is to make it so people come back to us direct. People generally, in the past, had a loyalty to a travel agent. Before there was any digital travel commerce at all, people went to the same travel agent all the time. Why? Because that person knew who you were. They knew what you could afford. They knew what you liked, and they'd give you a few choices, but they knew what you -- really was best. And then if anything went wrong, that person was there to fix anything that went wrong 24/7.</p><p>We want to recreate that same feeling using technology so it'd be a lot cheaper than a human being in a way that's even better because unlike the travel agent person, the database doesn't forget anything about you. It remembers it, so it knows what's good for you. It remembers all the things you've done in the past, so it can better personalize things in the future, all the things why technology is better. That's what we're trying to create. That is what we're creating. And that's why, I think, in the end, we'll have a much better direct rate in the future, but I'm not going to tell you how fast it's going to grow.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: What have been the factors that have been most successful in bringing the direct traffic above 50%? Has it been product changes? Has it been marketing channel mix? What's gotten that up to 50% -- above 50%?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Well, it's obviously many factors. But it's in the end, if you have a crappy experience, you don't go back. It's that simple. If you have a good experience, you come back. And clearly, what we really want is we love the fact that it's driving people to the app. The mobile world is really where everything is moving towards. And we need to make sure that people know and are aware of all the things that that app can do. In the connected trip, the app really is the center for the example I just gave. It gives you so much more information that you activate -- you can do an action on it immediately wherever you are.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. Let me ask you the regulation question then since we -- and it's one of the key overhangs, and we have a speaker later on this afternoon just focusing on it. Do you feel like big tech should be regulated more? Do you feel like Google should be regulated more than it is?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: It's an extremely broad question. That's the government at work. Well...</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Do you want to complain about Google?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: No, I don't want to complain about any of my partners. I will speak loudly because the mic is obviously -- can you hear me from the back?</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Right. We're good.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: All right. So the question about regulation, well, you want to have regulation that is fair to all the players. One of the things -- I know when you talk regulation tech -- let me go to an area that put more homes to the -- thank you.</p><p>Let's talk about the home business a little bit. Clearly, there's a lot of conflict, a lot of issues regarding the home industry. And we've always been in favor...</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: You mean alternative accommodations?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Alternative accommodations, exactly. We've always been in favor of having a platform that is fair to everybody. So yes, we want to do what is best for our customers. We want to do what's good for the host. We also want to do what's right for the communities because, let's face it, there is some issues. There are externalities in this alternative accommodation in certain cities of the world. People are saying, \"Hey, there are too many people coming to this neighborhood. It's overrunning the area.\" And we get it.</p><p>So we always want to work with the regulators in a way to create something that is fair and, let's say, equitable for all the players. That's the way all regulation should be done. And whether it be for our little part of the world in terms of the alternative accommodations where people start talking about, well, how do we handle political advertising on other platforms, all these things is taking into consideration all of the players and come up with something that actually works best for everybody, not one particular side.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay, okay. Let's just stay on alternative accommodations then for a little bit. Talk about how big of a business this has become for you. I think there's been a little bit of disclosure, not enough about how big the segment is. Talk about the relative attractiveness of it. I think as an OTA, more supply, more better. And alternative accommodations mean there are more places to stay when you're in Salzburg that should be good for your business. How well have you been able to get people to alternative accommodations? So just talk about how well positioned you think you are in that market.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So yes, we like where we are in that business. We continue to grow it. We have resources dedicated to continue to grow it out. We believe it's something people want, people enjoy. One of the great things about our method unlike some of our competitors is that we offer up the alternative accommodations and the hotel right on the same search result. Because most people, when you start thinking about where you're going to go, you're not sure what kind of a place you want to stay at. So it's great to see it all on one page, you can compare one against another and see all the elements of it.</p><p>Second thing is the way we do it, we don't believe we should offer a price up front, and then at the end, hit somebody with a traveler's fee. We're totally against that. Be transparent. Show the price right up front.</p><p>Another thing is instantly be able to confirm that booking. One of the things that I've actually had, my family, my wife again, she tried to -- she actually looked at another competitor's site to try and get a home. And she then told me how the event went. She went back and forth with the owner, back and forth, back and forth, and after a week, the person finally came back with, \"Never mind, don't want to rent it.\" Well, what a pain that is. Our platform, you get it instant confirmation. As soon as you want it, you get it.</p><p>I believe that's a better way to do it. I mean that's why we're going to continue to grow the way we're growing. And I believe in the long run, you're going to see a lot more people who are more comfortable using that product.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Okay. I think one of the things that may be somewhat underappreciated about Booking is how broad your footprint is or -- in Asia, you talked about ADR pressure. One of them is you have this ongoing mix shift towards some lower ADR Asian markets. Just talk about how well you're positioned -- you think you are in Asia, the China outbound travel, travel in Southeast Asia, et cetera.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So in the long run, Asia is absolutely going to be the dominating area of travel for some time. Growth in Asia in the long run can continue to outpace any other part of the world in terms of the growth factor. In the recent past, there have been some issues, trade war between the U.S. and China. You may be aware that China outbound of the U.S. Last year was the first year we actually had a decline of outbound China to the U.S. People have seen on TV some of the things happening in Hong Kong that has impacted travel to Hong Kong.</p><p>So there are always going to be areas of the world that can affect travel. And certainly, in Asia, we've had some things have actually -- I mean things you could actually see hitting your numbers. In the long run, though, we're going to continue to spend a lot of time, energy and effort in that area. And we have a great company besides Booking.com there. We have Agoda there, which was born and grew up in Asia, between Bangkok and Singapore. It's a great place for us to have talent, and people really understand those markets. When we say Asia, by the way, Asia is a lot of countries and a lot of different cultures, a lot of different ways to do business. And it's good to have both companies there to be able to have the resources necessary to be successful in what will continue to be the fastest-growing area for a long time.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: You pretty much have the right set of assets -- oh, I'm sorry, just talk just briefly about China and Ctrip. And I can't tell whether that was a positive development for you or not. That was a long-standing partnership. I know it still is, but it's shifted a little bit. You're now also working with Meituan in China. Are you better positioned now, the same or less well positioned than you were before?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Look, I'm very pleased with how we are situated in China in general. We have our organic growth there. We have almost 1,000 employees in China, our own employees, who are doing work there for both our Agoda and Booking.com brands. We also do things with partnerships. We have an investment in Ctrip. We've had that for a very long time. That continues. Ctrip continues to sell our hotels. We like that. We also have an investment in Meituan, like that one, too. And we have investment in DiDi, like that one, too.</p><p>So we have all different ways, organic, partnerships. And then we have relationships that we don't have investments in, standard affiliate relationships with some very big players in China. Lots of different ways to do it. Yes, right now, China economies had a little bit of a slowdown. Yes, that's impacted travel a little bit right now. But again, got to be there for the long term. You can't let a single year or a couple of years affect what your long-term goal is.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: I was going to ask about capital allocation and then open up to any Q&amp;A. Anything different about capital allocation that we should -- going forwards or consideration of paying a dividend? You've been consistently buying back stock for a while. You use that cash flow in a very shareholder-friendly manner, I think. But any thoughts on the dividend?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: No. Look, we will continue to evaluate, and we have no plans at the present time to do any sort of a dividend. We will continue to make sure that we are balanced in terms of what we're trying -- where we put the money to work in terms of building out the different services, products that we need for the future. We decide in terms of what we're going to do in terms of marketing spend. And we decide, \"Okay, what's the right amount to do in terms of buybacks?\" Always trying to maintain a good balance to maintain what is essentially a long-term view.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Any questions from the audience? Start on the left here, just shout it out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just wondering, given your competitive -- some of your competitors' issues (inaudible) positive progress we're seeing here. I wonder, is that -- and can you be more aggressive if the auction is the way those things are priced and acquisition spend these days, your competitors have less deep pockets in the moment. I wonder if that's (inaudible).</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: So we always are looking at what's going on in the marketplace. We always recognize that all the different elements of the travel business are extremely competitive. And whether it be the price that you offer to a consumer, whether it be the amount you pay in a pay-for-performance marketing auction, all these things extremely competitive. And there's a tremendous amount of game strategy going on. And you have to decide in terms of what your action will do, what will happen in return, always trying to figure out what's the right thing to maximize your long-term success. We're very pleased with where we are right now and the way we're running the company. Please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So on performance marketing, given that you are growing pretty nice low double digits, well, as marketing is down year-over-year, how do you think about the capacity to spend more on pay-for-performance marketing going forward to the extent the ROIs are there even if (inaudible)?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Well, one can always spend more money, that's for sure. But will you be able to spend at an ROI that you believe is appropriate at the time? Look, I would love to have better ROIs and have more traffic. It would be wonderful. Just keep going up like that. But the fact is these markets are dynamic. They move around. And depending on what you do is going to affect a lot of other things. You want to be very careful how you do your business. Again, I'm pleased with where we are with our ROIs. I'm pleased with our spend. If we thought it should be different, we would have already have done it.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: You've been the CEO now for the better part of 2 years.</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: It'll be 3 years in 1.5 months, not that I keep track of it.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F. MAHANEY: Yes. Like I said, about 3 years. And you've been with the company for 30 years. So the -- what was the biggest challenge that you found? What has been the biggest negative surprise since you've become CEO?</p><p>GLENN D. FOGEL: Well, I just got to say, it's 20, I'm not that old. It's 20 years, not 30. Look, this business has changed so much since I joined in February 2000. If you recall, February 2000, 3 weeks before the Internet bubble peaked and which shows that I have absolutely no way to choose where to go into a business. The fact that we are then desktop-only, right, and slow dial-up modems, and it's amazing that people did anything off the damn thing. Really, when you think about it now, can you believe that they waited 5 minutes for the thing to download? And look at where we are now. And so we went from desktop to you started to get broadband, you started getting mobile. Now you've got all this AI stuff coming in. And there are so many new things coming down the road, quantum computing, all these different things.</p><p>The fact is that if you're small, if you don't have research, you don't have capital, you'll be left behind because it changes -- everything is changing so rapidly. Us as a bigger player, we have the capability to maintain investment in these futuristic things to maintain ahead of the curve. And by the way, that helps us because our partners, the overwhelming majority of our partners, cannot possibly afford or even have the capability of even thinking about these things.</p><p>Our hotel partners, they're still making sure the flowers are good in the lobby, right? You think they've got big IT things to worry about, things like quantum computing? No. AI? No. All of these things, these things that we do, we do it at scale. And we provide these services to our partners at an incredibly affordable price. We don't charge them anything unless they make money. It's a great system. It's worked very, very well. And we're going to continue to do that. And I believe, over time, we'll become more and more successful for all these things I've just said about for the last 29 minutes.</p><p>MARK STEPHEN F.

Clarke famously stated 45 years ago that \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" Today, advanced technology is commonplace. But while some tech innovations might appear as inscrutable as magic, they don't work nearly as well, says Meredith Broussard, whose new book, \"Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World\" (MIT Press, $24.95), warns against the blind optimism toward technology -- an attitude she calls \"technochauvinism.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broussard, an assistant professor at New York University, began her career as a software developer before transitioning to data journalism. \"Journalists are taught to be skeptical,\" she writes. \"I started to question the promises of tech culture.\"</p><p>In the aftermath of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and the first pedestrian death caused by a self-driving car, this line of questioning, it seems, is now on everybody's mind. I spoke with Broussard in New York City. Our conversation has been edited.</p><p>--</p><p>How did you come up with the term \"technochauvinism\"?</p><p>I needed a term to encompass the kind of bias that says the technological solution is always better than every other solution. What I've realized after being a software developer and being in the high-tech world for many years is that we can't automatically assume the technological solution is the best one. There's more nuance.</p><p>For example, when you're teaching a kid to read, a board book is very helpful, because kids don't have the manual dexterity to use a mouse until elementary school. In order to use a mouse, you need to be able to tell your right from your left, which is something kids are not great at. A board book satisfies the need very well. It also never runs out of power. And you can drool on it. There wasn't a word that captured this particular kind of bias, so I invented one.</p><p>--</p><p>Does the word have a gendered connotation?</p><p>Absolutely, yes, there is a gender bias aspect to technochauvinism. As a woman of color in the high-tech industry, I had a very different experience than my white male colleagues. I tend to see different things. I'm working in a small but growing tradition of women of color critically examining technological systems. In the book, I talk about Latanya Sweeney, a Harvard professor who pointed out the racial bias in online ads. If you had a black-sounding name, you were getting ads and search results for things like bail bonds, whereas if you had a name like Christine, you were getting something neutral. Latanya Sweeney noticed this because her name is Latanya. It's not Christine.</p><p>--</p><p>You write that \"Computer systems are proxies for the people who made them.\" Mark Zuckerberg recently said that he never imagined he'd be dealing with election interference when he first started Facebook in his Harvard dorm room.</p><p>I mean, he should have imagined it. I went through the same education, and I certainly thought of it. When you have a system that is based on popularity like Facebook, of course you're going to have people who cheat. And they're going to cheat in every conceivable way.</p><p>--</p><p>What is the role of politicians?</p><p>I think at this point, we do need more regulation. We tried to run cyberspace like a commune. And it failed just as badly as the communes did.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: MEREDITH BROUSSARD writes about tech bias in book.

But this book is about more fundamental failures. It is about the ways in which the big tech companies have tended, in spite of their rhetoric, to work against the current values of liberal society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Its author, Sara Wachter-Boettcher is a web consultant who has acquired a substantial portfolio of evidence. Her primary preoccupation is inclusivity, something at which almost all the tech companies seem to be spectacularly bad. Obviously, they say they are good at it, but the figures prove them wrong. In 2014, for example, Apple revealed its diversity report. At the time 70% of its global staff was male, or 80% if you just counted technical jobs. Two years later, it was more or less unchanged. The number of blacks was 9%, falling to 3% in leadership positions.</p><p>The figures are typical across the industry because the mainly male, mainly white culture that founded Silicon Valley persists, largely because the companies have been spoilt into a kind of narcissistic paralysis by success and consumer worship. This book shows how their products suffer from built-in biases and are capable of quite spectacular insensitivities.</p><p>In the latter category is the personalised Year in Review Christmas card sent by Facebook to the programmer and blogger Eric Meyer. Little dancing figures surrounded a smiling picture of his daughter, Rebecca, who had died of cancer earlier that year. One would have thought that there are teams of Facebook nerds working to prevent such things. But these are, to the nerds, merely \"edge cases\", unhappy accidents.</p><p>Or there was Louise Selby, a British paediatrician whose swipe card wouldn't let her into her gym. It turned out the software considered everybody with the title \"Doctor\" must be a man.</p><p>Then there is Shane Creepingbear, a Native American who was prevented from joining Facebook because the algorithms decided his surname was a fake. This turns out to be a common problem for his race. Or there are the drop-down menus where you are expected to pick your race or gender. Trying to fit into the nerds' neat categories sends people down cyber-rabbit holes of rejection.</p><p>In the case of Twitter and Reddit, in particular, the algorithms have also become peculiarly hospitable to threats, bullying and every form of abuse imaginable. And Facebook has proved to be an excellent platform for Russian election tampering.</p><p>Individually these might seem trivial and easily fixable - and they do, in fairness, usually get fixed. But the author's case is that the failings are structural and a reflection of the fact that the tech companies have not yet grown up.</p><p>A big part of the problem, a little understated here, is the quasi-bolshevik ethos of the tech business. This has been underpinned by a supposedly respectable management theory called disruption. Hot new companies appear and grow by \"disrupting\" some existing business (Uber's assault on black cabs, for example). This embeds a kind of violence in tech culture.</p><p>One solution is to stop giving tech companies a regulatory get-out-of-jail-free card. So, imagine if we stopped thinking of Twitter, Google and Facebook as tech companies and called them what they are: publishers. Suddenly they would be hit by a regulatory tsunami and battered by libel and copyright litigation. They might even have to pay tax. Call Uber a taxi company and it would probably go out of business.</p><p>I suspect that Wachter-Boettcher is broadly right about all this, but I am not sure this book is quite up to the task she has set herself. It lacks focus and the tone is moany rather than sharp. The stories she tells, however, are good, as are the examples she provides of corporate failure.</p><p>In the end, the core problem is the excessive faith in the ability of machinery to capture humanity. Google's Marissa Mayer, for example, once rejected some web designs as looking too human. \"Google products are machine-driven,\" she said, \"that's what makes our products great.\"</p><p>Actually, Marissa, it makes them all too vulnerable to the kind of criticisms in this book. They become insensitive, exclusive, unable to adapt to their customers' whims and peculiarities. The one hope for the pale white boys and their algorithms is that humans succumb and become what the machines want them to be. But that's not going to happen.

The point she is making is that \u201cwe assume common activities are safer than novel or uncommon activities\u201d. </p><p>This explains why we fail to think driving is a dangerous activity (chance of dying in a car crash: 1 in 114), while many are terrified of flying (chance of dying in an air accident: 1 in 9,821). It also explains, pertinently for a book about the rise of artificial intelligence, why \u201cwe\u2019re similarly bad at assessing the risk of AI because we mindlessly use it every single day as we like and share stories, send emails and texts, speak to machines and allow ourselves to be nudged\u201d.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is already so deeply embedded in our lives that we don\u2019t notice it. As Webb says, the \u201ckiller robots\u201d fear that humans have about AI is way off the mark. Far more likely, she says, is that the detrimental effect of AI in future will be cumulative: we are in for \u201cpaper cuts\u201d \u2014 everyday hurts, small setbacks, that add up over time. </p><p>These \u201cpaper cuts\u201d can happen when AI algorithms take over from human decision-making. The flight boarding protocols used by most airlines, for example, are driven by algorithms, and usually it goes smoothly. But in April 2017, United Airlines staff on an overbooked plane from Chicago had failed to attract any takers for an $800 payment to take another flight. The algorithm suggested whom to remove. In this case, Webb says, \u201chuman staff had ceded authority to an AI system that was designed by relatively few individuals who probably hadn\u2019t thought enough about the future scenarios in which it would be used\u201d. The resulting footage of David Dao being dragged off the plane went viral. \u201cWhat everyone wanted to know: How could something like this happen in the United States?\u201d</p><p>The answer is: quite easily. The AI we get now (the future is a different matter) is a result of the choices and biases of the people who develop it. We have known this since 1968, when a US computer programmer and school teacher called Melvin Conway observed that \u201csystems tend to reflect the people and values who designed them\u201d. Conway\u2019s law is important in AI, and Webb, a professor of strategic foresight at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, offers up many examples. \u201cIf you \u2014 or someone whose gender, race, language, religion, politics and culture mirror your own \u2014 are not in the room where it happens, you can bet that whatever gets built won\u2019t reflect who you are.\u201d </p><p>Webb knows how to change things \u2014 get a more diverse group of people working in this field. But at the elite university level, where AI \u201ctribes\u201d form \u2014 many go on to work at the tech giants she describes elsewhere in the book \u2014 there is a dearth of women and people from ethnic minorities. In the US, women receive 18 per cent of undergraduate degrees in computer science, down from 37 per cent in 1985. </p><p>However upsetting, and potentially life-diminishing, the effects of current AI, Webb\u2019s visions for the future are worse. We have failed to make sure that AI is treated as a \u201cpublic good\u201d, rather than just a digital platform built by commercial giants. Leaving development of AI to big tech companies, with little to no governmental or regulatory oversight, has already been a colossal mistake. Unlike China (about which Webb has terrifying things to say), the US has never co-ordinated policies or pushed funding into universities, which she says is a total lack of planning and foresight.</p><p>The overarching theme of Webb\u2019s argument is a giant one: that the huge companies in the US and China \u2014 The Big Nine of the title \u2014 have an unassailable lead in introducing AI into our lives and that is going to have a profound impact in ways we cannot yet imagine. There is a geopolitical angle: in China the three giant companies \u2014 Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are closely tied to the government, and AI is a key part of the country\u2019s wider plans for dominance in the global economy. It already has a social credit score programme, which ranks and rates citizens on their behaviour, with real-world outcomes such as being able to travel, or not, and deciding which school children attend. </p><p>In the US, because the government has abdicated responsibility for developing AI as a social good, the free market has taken over, leaving ethical and legal decisions to the companies she calls the G-Mafia: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Apple. </p><p>Webb outlines three possible future scenarios for a world living with the \u201clearned helplessness\u201d of a G-Mafia-powered life where we are nudged to make the \u201cright\u201d choices in terms of eating, exercise and other habits through our smart devices, while creating a constant stream of personal data that will affect, for example, how much we pay for health insurance. </p><p>Even the most optimistic scenario is influenced by a coming change: \u201cWhile we argue that future generations are likely to be dumber because of technology, we never consider that we humans might someday find ourselves dumber than technology. It\u2019s an inflection point we are nearing and it has to do with our respective evolutionary limitations.\u201d Once AI becomes ASI (artificial superintelligence) it will, Webb says, be \u201cimpossible to imagine the consequences for our civilisation\u201d. </p><p>The most dystopian version of the future involves a Chinese global empire built \u201con the foundation of data\u201d and which might include a southern US border wall with Mexico, built by the Chinese to isolate Americans who do not have social credit scores, so cannot travel freely. </p><p>Webb\u2019s book at times reads like a thriller in which the ending looks bleak. But she affords us a clear, jargon-free view of the power and potential of AI \u2014 and how we as citizens should seek to influence its development \u2014 before a coming superintelligence shapes human lives in ways we cannot yet imagine.\u2002</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1541773756?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1541773756\"> The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity</url></emphasis>, by Amy Webb, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(PublicAffairs, \u00a313.99)</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-1eb9652a22ea11e9b20d5376ca5216eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0B-90N1-JB77-K3VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1045\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00022SO</classCode><className>UNITED AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Many people know him more directly for his Instapundit blog.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was one of the earliest popular bloggers and continues to be one of the most successful. Before Moore\u2019s Law delivered plentiful and cheap bandwidth unto us, many website servers would strain from all the hits an \u201cInstalanche\u201d (from the many readers following a link from his website) would deliver.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mr. Reynolds is a tech geek and a sci-fi enthusiast. He describes himself politically as a \u201clibertarian transhumanist.\u201d He believes that government should regulate with a light hand, if at all, and doesn\u2019t have many of the \u201cyuck\u201d reflexes that incline people to slam on the breaks when new technology threatens old ways of doing things.</p><p> Therefore, his new book, \u201cThe Social Media Upheaval,\u201d should serve as a good barometer for just how much trouble Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley tech titans are in, politically. The conclusion calls for \u201cpolicing platforms, and collusion among them.\u201d</p><p> It elaborates: \u201cAn approach based on antitrust competition will preserve free speech while reducing social media abuses. As social media grows more pervasive, and more obviously destructive, the pressure for regulation is sure to grow. Better to regulate in a way that preserves free speech, and that doesn\u2019t empower tech oligarchs.\u201d</p><p> Things have come to a pretty pass when libertarian law professors are suggesting renewed trust busting as a way to avoid even more censorious outcomes. How did we get here?</p><p> The 2016 election results were almost completely unexpected by anyone with any political or cultural pull. Our betters were simply gobsmacked by what happened and looked for someone to blame. They found it in Russian bots and Russian-bought ads on social media, which were said to have caused Hillary Clinton to lose her bid for the presidency.</p><p> \u201cResisters\u201d saw the face of the enemy, also, in anyone who either vocally supported Donald Trump, stuck up for his supporters, or was insufficiently hostile to Mr. Trump and his supporters.</p><p> Woke culture preceded the election, but President Trump\u2019s victory put it front-and-center and its obsessions became elite obsessions: Call outs, boycotts, crackdowns on all forms of alleged hate speech, de-platforming, and de-humanizing all who do not share the party line.</p><p> Social media has made such censorious efforts much easier, with the rise of \u201coutrage mobs.\u201d This has gone hand in glove with the increased tendency of folks to wall themselves off from sources of information that do not share their preconceptions and to substitute surface knowledge for real exploration and understanding. Too often, we share articles for the headlines without even so much as clicking on the link and reading it for ourselves.</p><p> The net effect of this activity, argues Mr. Reynolds, is that social media is making us dumber, meaner and more cocooned than ever before while at the same time feeding us the illusion of being in the right.</p><p> That\u2019s a dangerous mixture. It is made worse by the fact that a small number of social media platforms, crowdfunding sites, online payment firms, and credit card companies are making it much harder for alternative platforms to carve out room for other, dissenting voices in the name of stomping out \u201chate.\u201d</p><p> \u201cPaypal, for example, cut off money transfers to YouTube competitor BitChute, and Twitter competitor Gab,\u201d Mr. Reynolds writes. These options could become real alternative platforms over time, but the tech and financial industries are effectively colluding to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p> By stifling the platforms, Big Tech is also empowering the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites to feel free to stifle the speech of ornery users. After all, they really don\u2019t have anywhere to go.</p><p> Given all that, it\u2019s no wonder that to this law professor, and to many conservatives as well, anti-trust begins to look like the most appealing option. If President Trump is re-elected, expect the powers-that-be in Silicon Valley to face harsh new regulation.</p><p> A few final words about \u201cThe Social Media Upheaval\u201d\u2019s structure and prose: There are no chapters to be found here. The work is one long essay, broken up by subtitles and occasionally distracting pull quotes.</p><p> Mr. Reynolds cites generously and quotes liberally, though in no case did I find myself rushing past the longer quotations from his sources. It used to be a burn on a book to say that it \u201creads like a blog post,\u201d but in this long pamphlet form it\u2019s not bad. At least it doesn\u2019t read like a series of tweets.</p><p> \u2022 Jeremy Lott is creator and writer of the Movie Men comic book.</p><p> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p> THE SOCIAL MEDIA UPHEAVAL</p><p> By Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p> Encounter Books, $7.99, 64 pages</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-1767BA4B6CCA7228</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7K-S6H1-DXVP-V4S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>10 October 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Data, he says, is the new oil. For Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>it's their entire business. For Apple it's the candy that keeps us pecking at the devices it makes: a tweet here, a selfie there, a quick check of the weather before we leave the house. And for Amazon data is how you turn the biggest warehouse on Earth into an incredibly streamlined business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a catch: if all this data is so valuable, why are we giving it to tech companies for free? And if the trade-off is getting their services in return, are we really getting a good deal? <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>made $3.89bn in profit in just three months this year, up 71% from the year before. Much of that came from selling adverts against content that was either uploaded by users, or put on the social network by journalists and other creators who have seen their own industries hollowed out. Are we all working for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>now?</p><p>Foer has an axe to grind here. In 2012, a 28-year-old multimillionaire called Chris Hughes, who had the good fortune to be <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>roommate at Harvard, bought a venerable American liberal magazine called the New Republic. He installed Foer as its editor, jointly interviewed Barack Obama with him, and promised the editorial team the kind of investment needed to do longform journalism.</p><p>But, at some point, his and Foer's visions diverged. Hughes wanted a huge expansion in audience numbers, and believed that data-driven commissioning and more \"snackable content\" would help deliver it. \"He fired me after two and a half years - a bust-up interpreted widely as a parable of Silicon Valley's failure to understand the journalistic world over which it now exerted so much influence,\" Foer writes. \"There's no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book.\"</p><p>Journalists are now tenant farmers. Pleasing Google matters more than pleasing readers</p><p>This isn't just a hack's sour grapes - although journalists have more cause than most to worry about the power of the tech firms. Together, Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>control two-thirds of the digital advertising market. If the media wants a slice of that, it has to play by their rules: writing headlines that appeal to search engines, or switching from text to video to satisfy <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>belief in the latter. Journalists are now tenant farmers. Pleasing Google matters more than pleasing their core readers.</p><p>Other professions should worry, too. One of the most shocking stories in the book is how Amazon played hardball in its contract negotiations with publishers by delaying shipments or discouraging sales of their books. Given that the site is responsible for half the US book market, these strong-arm tactics must have affected a few literary careers.</p><p>Then there's everyone else. Foer argues passionately that we are sleepwalking into a world where \"we're constantly watched and constantly distracted\". He accuses tech titans of megalomania and, more surprising, of being fundamentally opposed to the basic tenet of capitalism, which is that competitive markets lead to greater choice and efficiency for consumers. Amazon and the rest don't believe in markets, he argues, they aspire to be monopolies.</p><p>Worse, there is no regulator big enough, or government savvy enough, to rein them in. Even trying to get them to pay the same rates of tax as bricks-and-mortar stores is a continuing struggle for many countries.</p><p>The sheer size of the big tech companies also means their huge, and largely invisible, power is very worrying. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has publicly boasted of being able to drive up voter turnout with election-day reminders. What happens, then, if <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has strong feelings about which candidate should win, \"so instead of urging all citizens to perform their civic duty, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>calibrates its call to action to target only the voters who will pull the lever for Zuckerberg's candidate\"?</p><p>Near the end of the book, Foer predicts a tech version of the financial crisis of 2007/8, a moment when our valuable data is so wantonly mistreated that we lose faith in the whole system. Until then, it's Silicon Valley's world. We just live in it.Cape \u00a318.99 pp257</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-37769545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJF-WKW1-F021-62WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 24, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00096SP</classCode><className>MARKETING &amp;

When he started pulling on the threads of big tech, he cannot have imagined in his wildest dreams that Silicon Valley's carefully crafted cloak of techno-invincibility would have unravelled quite as dramatically as it has over the past few months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hate attacks, trolling, fake news, live murders, advertising boycotts, cyber-bullying, facilitating secret communication by terrorists: the charge sheet against Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, Yahoo and WhatsApp is long and growing. Apple has been ordered to pay (EURO)13bn in back taxes by the EU. Uber stands accused of ripping off its drivers by classifying them as freelance \"gig economy\" workers, rather than employees.</p><p>Taplin wields his axe mercilessly. Facebook and Google (which owns YouTube) are vast digital behemoths that \"steal\" the work of musicians, artists, writers and journalists and \"exploit\" it to corner the market in online advertising. Thanks to YouTube, Google is the largest media company in the world. In America, it collects $60bn in advertising a year, almost double that of its nearest and longer-established rival, Disney, he writes. The richer Google and Facebook get, the poorer musicians, film-makers and artists become. Taplin claims the web giants' \"piracy\" costs its victims collectively an estimated \u00a340bn a year.</p><p>He draws on shocking examples to show how Twitter's shield of anonymity (you can use an alias to post tweets) \"brings out the worst in humans\". Rape and murder threats are commonplace, usually directed at strangers. While gig-economy firms, notably Uber, are destroying job security, Amazon and many other tech giants are going further, using robots and artificial intelligence (AI) to get rid of error-prone, unreliable workers. Half of US jobs face being automated away, the book argues. Who needs people, right?</p><p>Taplin marshals statistics skilfully to chart how tech firms have overtaken \"big oil\" to become the world's wealthiest and most powerful companies. Google accounts for 90% of search queries in Europe and America. Facebook has a 77% share of the mobile social networking sector and is overtaking traditional newspapers and broadcasters to become, for many, their dominant news source. Amazon takes 53 cents of every dollar Americans spend online, more than half the e-commerce market in the largest economy in the world. No oil company could get away with that market dominance, but big tech has pulled it off by, yes, creating products that most of us find so magical we can't resist signing up, but also by lobbying governments hard to avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Taplin is strongest when describing how the web threatens journalism and the arts. It is not just the creatives' loss of income that bothers him. In a world of auto-tune, clickbait and 24/7 social media, he wonders \"if an artist like David Bowie could have a career in today's music business. He didn't make hits; he made complex works that took a while to understand.\" Taplin feels the loss personally. He spent years working in the music and movie businesses. He managed concerts for Bob Dylan, worked with George Harrison, and produced Martin Scorsese's 1973 classic Mean Streets, before turning to writing.</p><p>He puts forward proposals to help to redress the balance in favour of artists. Governments should adopt a more restrictive definition of \"fair use\", which currently allows almost anyone to upload content, copyrighted or not, to sites such as YouTube. It is no longer acceptable, he argues, for the tech giants to maintain that the web is too big for them to police and that they are merely digital \"platforms\", rather than publishers, and so bear no responsibility for the content on their sites. They should remove pirated content, just as they remove pornography and jihadist recruitment videos. Since Google has an effective monopoly on an important service, web search, it is akin to a public utility, Taplin writes, and should be forced to share its proprietary tech, for a reasonable fee, with all companies to encourage competition. (Good luck with that.)</p><p>pullquoteThe charge sheet against the companies is long and growing</p><p>He is weakest when it comes to politics and economics. He pins the blame for the transformation of the web from a decentralised, democratic information and communications revolution into the private monopoly of the robber barons of our times on a coterie of US tech libertarians, notably Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder, Facebook backer and now adviser to President Trump. This group, he argues, disdain democracy and believe \"they have both the brilliance and moral fortitude to operate outside the normal strictures of law and taxes\" and also a duty to create a \"techno-determinist oligarchy\". I'm not so sure. Most of the Silicon Valley bosses I have met are too socially dysfunctional to be part of some global right-wing conspiracy. And Taplin somehow forgets to mention that, when pressed (as they were last November), almost every big tech CEO backed Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Taplin's claim that technology is destroying jobs and job security is equally questionable. Yes, the gig economy can be rough, but for every frustrated Uber driver, there is a happy gig worker renting out his or her home on Airbnb or setting up a craft business on Etsy. AI could end up creating way more jobs than he predicts it will destroy because it will increase firms' productivity, helping them to grow, and will also create new jobs not yet imagined. Millions of people now do jobs that not only did not exist but also would have been difficult even to imagine 10 years ago - app developers, virtual-world designers, ride-share drivers and social media marketers. I bet we'll soon start seeing ads for robot supervisors.</p><p>However, by the end of this book, you will agree with Taplin that the tech firms are abusing their monopoly power to rip us off and debase our culture - breaking the world, as he sees it. Hence the ironic use of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's startup motto as the book's title.</p><p>It is time for consumers to break back.

Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction[3] by Thomas M. Siebel, Rosetta Books From visionary Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tom Siebel comes a penetrating examination of the new technologies that are disrupting business and government\u2014and how organizations can harness them to transform into digital enterprises. The confluence of four technologies\u2014elastic cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things\u2014is fundamentally changing how business and government will operate in the 21st century. Siebel masterfully guides readers through a fascinating discussion of the game-changing technologies driving digital transformation and provides a roadmap to seize them as a strategic opportunity. He shows how leading enterprises such as Enel, 3M, Royal Dutch Shell, the U.S. Department of Defense, and others are applying AI and IoT with stunning results. Digital Transformation is the guidebook every business and government leader needs to survive and thrive in the new digital age. The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America[4] byMargaret O'Mara, Penguin Press The epic human story of how, out of a small patch of land in Northern California, high tech recreated America in its image, for good and for ill. Long before Margaret O'Mara became one of our most consequential historians of the American-led digital revolution, she worked in the White House of Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the earliest days of the commercial Internet. There she saw first-hand how deeply intertwined Silicon Valley was with the federal government, and always had been, and how shallow the common understanding of the secrets of the Valley's success actually was. Now, after almost five years of pioneering research, O'Mara has produced the definitive history of Silicon Valley for our time, the story of mavericks and visionaries, but also of powerful institutions creating the framework for innovation, from the Pentagon to Stanford University. It is also a story of a community that started off remarkably homogeneous and elitist and stayed that way, and whose belief in its own mythology has deepened into a collective hubris that has led to astonishing triumphs as well as devastating second-order effects. Deploying a wonderfully rich and diverse cast of protagonists, from the justly famous to the unjustly obscure, across four generations of explosive growth in the Valley, from the Forties to the present, O'Mara has wrestled into magnificent narrative form one of the most fateful developments in modern American history. She is on the ground with all of the key tech companies, and chronicles the evolution in their offerings through each successive era, and she has a profound fingertip feel for the politics of the sector, and its relation to the larger cultural narrative about tech as it has evolved over the years. Perhaps most impressively, O'Mara has penetrated the inner kingdom of tech venture capital firms, the insular and still remarkably old-boy world that became the cockpit of American capitalism and the crucible for bringing technological innovation to market, or not. The transformation of big tech into the engine room of the American economy and the nexus of so many of our hopes and dreams\u2014and increasingly nightmares\u2014can be understood, in Margaret O'Mara's masterful hands, as the story of one California valley. As her majestic history makes clear, its fate is the fate of us all. How to Make a Plant Love You: Cultivate Green Space in Your Home and Heart[5] by Summer Rayne Oakes, Optimism Press Summer Rayne Oakes, an urban houseplant expert and environmental scientist, is the icon of wellness-minded millennials who want to bring nature indoors. Summer has managed to grow 1,000 houseplants in her Brooklyn apartment (and they're thriving!) Her secret? She approaches her relationships with plants as intentionally as if they were people. Everyone deserves to feel the inner peace that comes from taking care of greenery. Beyond the obvious benefits\u2014beauty and cleaner air\u2014there's a strong psychological benefit to nurturing plants as a path to mindfulness. They can reduce our stress level, lower our blood pressure, and improve our overall outlook. And they offer a rare opportunity to find joy by caring for another living being. When Summer Rayne Oakes moved to Brooklyn from the Pennsylvania countryside, she knew that bringing nature indoors was her only chance to stay sane. She found them by the side of the road, in long-forgotten window boxes, at farmers' markets, and in local garden shops. She found ways to shelve, hang, tuck, anchor, secure, and suspend them. She even installed 150-foot expandable hose that connects to pipes under her kitchen sink, so she only has to spend about a half-hour a day tending to her plants\u2014an activity that she describes as a 'moving meditation.' This is Summer's guidebook for cultivating an entirely new relationship with your plant children. Inside, you'll learn to: Pause for the flowers and greenery all around you, even the ones sprouting bravely between cracked pavement Trust that your apartment jungle offers you far more than pretty dcor See the world from a plant's perspective, trading modern consumerism for sustainability Serve your chlorophyllic friends by learning to identify the right species for your home and to recreate their natural habitat (Bonus: your indoor garden won't die!) When we become plant parents, we also become better caretakers of ourselves, the people around us, and our planet. So, let's step inside the world of plants and discover how we can begin cultivating our own personal green space\u2014in our homes, in our minds, and in our hearts.

Colonize This!: Young Women of Color on Today's Feminism[8], edited by Daisy Hernndez ...shra Rehman, Seal Press Newly revised and updated, this landmark anthology offers gripping portraits of American life as seen through the eyes of young women of color It has been decades since women of color first turned feminism upside down, exposing the feminist movement as exclusive, white, and unaware of the concerns and issues of women of color from around the globe. Since then, key social movements have risen, including Black Lives Matter, transgender rights, and the activism of young undocumented students. Social media has also changed how feminism reaches young women of color, generating connections in all corners of the country. And yet we remain a country divided by race and gender. Now, a new generation of outspoken women of color offer a much-needed fresh dimension to the shape of feminism of the future. In Colonize This!, Daisy Hernandez and Bushra Rehman have collected a diverse, lively group of emerging writers who speak to the strength of community and the influence of color, to borders and divisions, and to the critical issues that need to be addressed to finally reach an era of racial freedom. With prescient and intimate writing, Colonize This! will reach the hearts and minds of readers who care about the experience of being a woman of color, and about establishing a culture that fosters freedom and agency for women of all races. This Land: How Cowboys, Capitalism, and Corruption are Ruining the American West[9] byChristopher Ketcham, Viking A hard-hitting look at the battle now raging over the fate of the public lands in the American West\u2014and a plea for the protection of these last wild placesThe public lands of the western United States comprise some 450 million acres of grassland, steppe land, canyons, forests, and mountains. It's an American commons, and it is under assault as never before.Journalist Christopher Ketcham has been documenting the confluence of commercial exploitation and governmental misconduct in this region for over a decade. His revelatory book takes the reader on a journey across these last wild places, to see how capitalism is killing our great commons. Ketcham begins in Utah, revealing the environmental destruction caused by unregulated public lands livestock grazing, and exposing rampant malfeasance in the federal land management agencies, who have been compromised by the profit-driven livestock and energy interests they are supposed to regulate. He then turns to the broad effects of those corrupt politics on wildlife. He tracks the Department of Interior's failure to implement and enforce the Endangered Species Act\u2014including its stark betrayal of protections for the grizzly bear and the sage grouse\u2014and investigates the destructive behavior of U.S. Wildlife Services in their shocking mass slaughter of animals that threaten the livestock industry. Along the way, Ketcham talks with ecologists, biologists, botanists, former government employees, whistleblowers, grassroots environmentalists and other citizens who are fighting to protect the public domain for future generations.This Landis a colorful muckraking journey\u2014part Edward Abbey, part Upton Sinclair\u2014exposing the rot in American politics that is rapidly leading to the sell-out of our national heritage. The book ends with Ketcham's vision of ecological restoration for the American West: freeing the trampled, denuded ecosystems from the effects of grazing, enforcing the laws already in place to defend biodiversity, allowing the native species of the West to recover under a fully implemented Endangered Species Act, and establishing vast stretches of public land where there will be no development at all, not even for recreation. Everything Below the Waist: Why Health Care Needs a Feminist Revolution[10] byJennifer Block, St. Martin's Press An eye-opening, investigative account of the dismal state of women's healthcare in the U.S. American women visit more doctors, have more surgery, and fill more prescriptions than men. InEverything Below the Waist,Jennifer Block asks: Why is the life expectancy of women today declining relative to women in other high-income countries, and even relative to the generation before them? Block examines several staples of modern women's health care, from fertility technology to contraception to pelvic surgery to miscarriage treatment, and finds that while overtreatment and mistreatment persist in medicine writ large, they are particularly acute for women. One third of mothers give birth by major surgery; roughly half of women lose their uterus to hysterectomy.Feminism turned the world upside down, yet to a large extent the doctors' office has remained stuck in time. Block returns to the 1970s women's health movement to understand how in today's supposed age of empowerment, women's bodies are still so vulnerable to medical control\u2014particularly their sex organs, and as result, their sex lives.In this urgent book, Block tells the stories of patients, clinicians, and reformers, uncovering history and science that could revolutionize the standard of care, and change the way women think about their health.Everything Below the Waistchallenges all people to take back control of their bodies.

Brandt offers concrete examples of how any organization\u2014large or small, and regardless of industry\u2014can innovate in ways that delight customers and attract top-level talent.Nincompoopery\u2014terrible customer service, idiotic business processes, and soul-crushing management practices\u2014surrounds all of us.

It usually starts by asking a simple question or two, such as Why should our customers have to rekey their data multiple times to make a single purchase? Why are there four levels of approval just to order basic supplies? Why can't we get qualified candidates for open positions, or provide new employees with decent training? In short: How did we become such nincompoops? And when will we stop? Nincompooperyoffers leaders the answers they need\u2014and the profits they crave\u2014with a scoop of humor on the side. Enjoy!

In the tradition of Mountains Beyond Mountains and The Orchid Thief, Stronghold is Tucker Malarkey's gripping account of one man's determination to protect the world's last bastion for wild salmon. From a young age, Guido Rahr was a misfit among his family and classmates, preferring to spend his time in the natural world, on his family's land on the Deschutes River in Oregon. Over the years, as he became an expert fly fisherman, he noticed that each year fewer salmon were returning to their place of birth to spawn, and set out to learn why. What he discovered alarmed him; as the river homes of these fish became increasingly inhospitable to them, due to dams, industry, and climate change, the salmon of the Pacific Rim seemed destined to quickly go the way of the salmon who once filled the Atlantic Ocean: near extinction. An improbable and inspiring story, Stronghold takes us on a wild and at times dangerous adventure\u2014from Oregon to Alaska to one of the world's last remaining salmon strongholds, in the Russian Far East\u2014a landscape of ecological richness and diversity that is rapidly being developed for oil, gas, minerals, and timber. As Rahr befriends and navigates scientists, conservationists, corrupt officials, Russian oligarchs, unexpected allies, and impenetrable bureaucracies, he reveals the astonishing natural history of the endangered salmon, an extraordinary species whose demise will reverberate across the planet. And he sets into motion a plan that can secure their survival. Tucker Malarkey, who accompanies Rahr to the Russian wilderness and reports from up close, has written a clarion call for a sustainable future, a beautiful and riveting account of a species whose future is closely linked to that of our own. Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language[14] byGretchen McCulloch, Riverhead Books A linguistically informed look at how our digital world is transforming the English language. Language is humanity's most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time. Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer 'LOL' or 'lol,' why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread. Because Internet is essential reading for anyone who's ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are. Trust First: A True Story About the Power of Giving People Second Chances[15] byBruce Deel, with Sara Grace, Optimism Press If we choose to trust unconditionally, how many lives could we change? When Pastor Bruce Deel took over the Mission Church in the 30314 zip code of Atlanta, he had orders to shut it down. The church was old and decrepit, and its neighborhood\u2014known as 'Better Leave, You Effing Fool,' or 'the Bluff,' for short\u2014had the highest rates of crime, homelessness, and incarceration in Georgia. Expecting his time there to only last six months, Deel was not prepared for what happened next. One Sunday, he was approached by a woman he didn't know. 'I've been hooking and stripping for fourteen years,' she said. 'Can you help me?' Soon after, Bruce founded an organization called City of Refuge rooted in the principle of radical trust. Other nonprofits might drug test before offering housing, lock up valuables, or veto a program giving job skills and character references to felons as 'a liability.' But Bruce believed the best way to improve outcomes for the marginalized and impoverished was to extend them trust, even if that trust was violated multiple times\u2014and even if someone didn't yet trust themselves. Since then, City of Refuge has helped over 20,000 people in Atlanta's toughest neighborhood escape the cycles of homelessness, joblessness, and drug abuse. Of course, trust alone can't overcome a broken system that perpetuates inequality. Presenting an unvarnished window into the lives of ex-cons, drug addicts, human trafficking survivors, and displaced souls who have come through City of Refuge, Trust First examines the context in which Bruce's Atlanta neighborhood went downhill\u2014and what City of Refuge chose to do about it. They've become a one-stop-shop for transitional housing, on-site medical and mental health care, childcare, and vocational training, including accredited intensives in auto tech, culinary arts, and coding. While most social services focus on one pain point and leave the burden on the poor to find the crosstown bus that'll serve their other needs, Bruce argues that bringing someone out of homelessness requires treating all of their needs simultaneously. This model has proven so effective that a dozen new chapters of City of Refuge have opened in the US, including in California, Illinois, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, and Georgia. More than a narrative about a single place in time, this radical primer for behavioral change belongs on every leader's shelf. Heartfelt, deeply personal, and inspiring, Trust First will break down your assumptions about whether anyone is ever truly a lost cause. Bruce will donate a portion of his proceeds from Trust First to the charitable organization City of Refuge. Amazing Decisions: The Illustrated Guide to Improving Business Deals and Family Meals[16] byDan Ariely, illustrated by Matt R. Trower, Hill ...ng A bestselling author's cartoon guide to better decision-making. The internationally renowned author Dan Ariely is known for his incisive investigations into the messy business of decision-making. Now, in Amazing Decisions, his unique perspective\u2014informed by behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychology\u2014comes alive in the graphic form. The illustrator Matt R. Trower's playful and expressive artwork captures the lessons of Ariely's groundbreaking research as they explore the essential question: How can we make better decisions? Amazing Decisions follows the narrator, Adam, as he faces the daily barrage of choices and deliberations. He juggles two overlapping\u2014and often contradictory\u2014sets of norms: social norms and market norms. These norms inform our thinking in ways we often don't notice, just as Adam is shadowed by the 'market fairy' and the 'social fairy,' each compelling him to act in certain ways. Good decision-making, Ariely argues, requires us to identify and evaluate the forces at play under different circumstances, leading to an optimal outcome. Amazing Decisions is a fascinating and entertaining guide to developing skills that will prove invaluable in personal and professional life. The Making of a Democratic Economy: How to Build Prosperity for the Many, Not the Few[17] byMarjorie Kelly ...d Howard, Berrett-Koehler Our economy is designed by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. This book offers a compelling vision of an equitable, ecologically sustainable alternative that meets the essential needs of all people.We live in a world where twenty-six billionaires own as much wealth as half the planet's population. The extractive economy we live with now enables the financial elite to squeeze out maximum gain for themselves, heedless of damage to people or planet. But Marjorie Kelly and Ted Howard show that there is a new economy emerging focused on helping everyone thrive while respecting planetary boundaries.At a time when competing political visions are at stake the world over, this book urges a move beyond tinkering at the margins to address the systemic crisis of our economy. Kelly and Howard outline seven principles of what they call a Democratic Economy: community, inclusion, place (keeping wealth local), good work (putting labor before capital), democratized ownership, ethical finance, and sustainability. Each principle is paired with a place putting it into practice: Pine Ridge, Preston, Portland, Cleveland, and more.This book tells stories not just of activists and grassroots leaders but of the unexpected accomplices of the Democratic Economy. Seeds of a future beyond corporate capitalism and state socialism are being planted in hospital procurement departments, pension fund offices, and even company boardrooms.The road to a system grounded in community, democracy, and justice remains uncertain. Kelly and Howard help us understand we make this road as we walk it by taking a first step together beyond isolation and despair. Why Digital Transformations Fail: The Surprising Disciplines of How to Take Off and Stay Ahead[18] byTony Saldanha, Berrett-Koehler Former Procter ...mble Vice President for IT and Shared Services, Tony Saldanha gives you the keys to a successful digital transformation: a proven five-stage model and a disciplined process for executing it. Digital transformation is more important than ever now that we're in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where the lines between the physical, digital, and biological worlds are becoming ever more blurred. But fully 70 percent of digital transformations fail. Why? Tony Saldanha, a globally awarded industry thought-leader who led operations around the world and major digital changes at Procter ...mble, discovered it's not due to innovation or technological problems. Rather, the devil is in the details: a lack of clear goals and a disciplined process for achieving them. In this book, Saldanha lays out a five-stage process for moving from digitally automating processes here and there to making digital technology the very backbone of your company. For each of these five stages, Saldanha describes two associated disciplines vital to the success of that stage and a checklist of questions to keep you on track. You want to disrupt before you are disrupted\u2014be the next Netflix, not the next Blockbuster. Using dozens of case studies and his own considerable experience, Saldanha shows how digital transformation can be made routinely successful, and instead of representing an existential threat, it will become the opportunity of a lifetime. Surrounded by Idiots: The Four Types of Human Behavior and How to Effectively Communicate with Each in Business (and in Life)[19] byThomas Erikson, St. Martin's Essentials Master the four basic behavior types and change the way you communicate! A runaway bestseller in Sweden that has sold more than a million copies worldwide, Surrounded by Idiots shares a groundbreaking new method of understanding the people around you that will change how you interact with everyone from your coworkers to your spouse. Author Thomas Erikson explains that there are four key behavior types that define how we interact with and perceive the people around us. Understanding someone's pattern of behavior is the key to successful communication. Erikson breaks down the four kinds of behavior types\u2014Reds who are dominant and commanding, Yellows who are social and optimistic, Greens who are laid back and friendly, and Blues who are analytical and precise\u2014and explains how to identify and interact with each type of person. Instead of being bogged down with overly technical categorizations, the simple four color system allows you to speedily identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them. Surrounded by Idiots is full of practical information for interacting with people based on their color, including the strengths and weaknesses of all the profiles, how to give positive and negative feedback to each, and the best way to word an email when writing to someone with a different profile. Quantum Leadership: New Consciousness in Business[20] byFrederick Chavalit Tsao ...ris Laszlo, Stanford Business Books Solving the world's sustainability challenges requires business creativity, and that will come about only when business leaders are able to raise their consciousness \u2014 through mindfulness and practices that increase their awareness of how their actions impact others as well as generations to come. In this new book, Frederick Chavalit Tsao and Chris Laszlo argue that current approaches to leadership fail to produce positive outcomes for either businesses or the communities they serve. Employee disengagement and customer fickleness remain high, resulting in a lack of creativity and collaboration at all levels of entrepreneurial activity. Investor demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) continues to be poorly integrated into profit strategies. Drawing on extensive research, this book shows how changing a person's consciousness is the most powerful lever for unlocking his or her leadership potential to create wealth and serve humankind. A wide range of practices of connectedness provide the keys. The journey to higher consciousness changes people at a deep intuitive level, combining embodied experience with analytic-cognitive skill development. Tsao and Laszlo show how leaders who pursue this journey are more likely to flourish with significant benefits to both business and society. These include greater creativity and collaboration along with an increased capability to inspire people and produce lasting change. Readers will come away with a deep understanding of quantum leadership and the day-to-day practices that can help them achieve greater effectiveness and wellbeing at work.

This week, our choices are:Cosy: The British Art of Comfort[1] by Laura Weir, HarperOne | We in Wisconsin received our first dose of snow a few days ago, so this book is a necessary addition to the stacks that might make winter a little more bearable. No fireplace necessary! When bad weather requires me to stay inside, I often feel trapped and claustrophobic, but this small book's calming and insightful notes and illustrations encourage me to think differently about my housebound experiences. </p><p>\"As the world outside our window becomes more unpredictable, the notion of hunkering down in a sanctuary that we can control amidst the chaos has a covetous appeal.\" With chapters devoted to various elements of cosiness (tea, clothing, crafting, self-care, etc.) and how to achieve them, reading this is like a leisurely walk in which you breathe more slowly and think more clearly and see more fully that life is alright and that not accomplishing something is an accomplishment. (GMC) Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles\u2014and All of Us[2] by Rana Foroohar, Currency | Our personal data is the oil of the information age, and its extraction has fueled the rise of the new, Big Tech elite. As Rana Foroohar began digging into the financial data in her role as the global business columnist for the Financial Times, she 'discovered something rather shocking\u2014that 80 percent of the global wealth was now being held by just about 10 percent of the companies.' The now dominant entities in that upper echelon include the five 'FAANG' companies\u2014Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2014whose market capitalization, Foroohar notes, now exceeds the world's seventh largest economy, France. She documents the economic, political, and cognitive effects of their ascendence, and suggests remedies for reigning in some of Big Tech's now unrivaled power and influence over our public and private life, including regulation on the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission that checked the power of the railroad barons in our nation's previous Gilded Age, and a Digital New Deal to ensure employment and create a new public infrastructure for the information age. (DJJS) Jubilee: Recipes from Two Centuries of African-American Cooking: A Cookbook[3] by Toni Tipton-Martin, Clarkson Potter | Toni Tipton-Martin is on a mission to expand our vision of African American cooking, and I am so grateful for her work. After collecting a staggering 400 cookbooks spanning nearly two centuries of black cooking, she wrote her first book, the James Beard-Award Winning The Jemima Code. Her newest book further mines her collection to reveal the glorious breadth of the cuisine, through verbatim historical recipes, amalgamations of multiple versions, and new recipes inspired by her research, all of which stretch popular notions of the cuisine. 'In Jubilee, I have tried to honor the kind of joyous cooking that would have turned yesterday's enslaved and free cooks into today's celebrity chefs with glittering reputations grounded in restaurant fare and cookbook publishing.' Featuring standards like Rice and Peas with Coconut and seven kinds of cornbread (I am in heaven!), the book shines most brightly when revealing new additions to the canon such as Beets touffe or Roast Turkey with Chile-Pecan Sauce, both of which are sure to make your Thanksgiving one to brag about for the ages. No American cookbook shelf is complete without a copy of Jubilee, and no review of the book would be complete without praise for the gorgeous photography by Jerrelle Guy (author of Black Girl Baking). Her sensitive work brings this instant American classic to life and is a reminder that representation matters always, even in cookbook hand modeling. (BRM) The Mysterious Affair at Olivetti: IBM, the CIA, and the Cold War Conspiracy to Shut Down Production of the World's First Desktop Computer[4] by Meryle Secrest, Knopf | Meryle Secrest is a master biographer of a dazzlingly diverse array of subjects. Her new subject came to her out of a personal encounter with Roberto Olivetti\u2014heir to Italy's Olivetti company\u2014whom a good friend had fallen in love with while living in Italy after World War II, and whom Secrest met during his brief weekend visit to Washington in 1964. Returning to a short story she wrote about that weekend led her to track down what became of Roberto. An inquiry that began out of 'idle curiosity' leads her to a Cold War mystery replete with industrial history and espionage, international intrigue, early death, and the creation of the world's first desktop computer. And, though it may all seem rather esoteric at first, the story is surprisingly relevant to the conversation we are having today about the nature of electronic machines and industrial development, art, and design, about technology and its role in our society and daily lives. What Secrest utlimately does on her investigative journey is uncover a vital piece of almost lost industrial and engineering history that helped land a man on the moon and played an unsung (until now) role in mid-century business and geopolitics. (DJJS) That's Mental: Painfully Funny Things That Drive Me Crazy About Being Mentally Ill[5]by Amanda Rosenberg, Turner | Mental illness is one of those topics that many people avoid like the plague. In fact, we may find it easier to talk about plagues than to talk about mental illness. Amanda Rosenberg engages in a lively, self-aware, and darkly humorous conversation with the reader about her experience with bipolar II and \"a few other mental disorders, but I'll leave you to find them in the book; it'll be like a fun Easter egg hunt, only the eggs are rotten and it's not fun at all!\" Her mental illnesses had been overlooked for years by everyone including herself, and she shares her journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance from a place where she is still wrestling with various mental disorders and their side effects. \"You don't need to feel good in the grey; you just need to tolerate it.\" For as frustrating as it can be having to figure out your own brain, Rosenberg's writing is friendly and heartening enough to read in as little as one or two sittings.

All that and more in this Bookworm Beat.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bookwormroom.com/2016/09/18/the-bookworm-beat-91816-the-people-are-singing-edition-and-open-thread/woman-writing-300x265-6/Apparently\">http://www.bookwormroom.com/2016/09/18/the-bookworm-beat-91816-the-people-are-singing-edition-and-open-thread/woman-writing-300x265-6/Apparently</url> 'honesty' and 'integrity' have a different meaning inside the beltway. I was one of the millions who appreciated Admiral McRaven's commencement speech at the University of Texas a few years ago, when he spoke about life lessons he'd picked up as a SEAL. </p><p>Indeed, ever since then, I make my bed every morning. As he said, you'll start your day with an accomplishment and, if it's been a bad day, you come home to a nicely made bed. Those are two solid reasons to make a bed. Just because I like McRaven's homespun military wisdom, though, doesn't mean I have to like his politics. Nor do I have to like the loopy Leftist logic that he reveals thanks to his politics. For example, in a much touted op-ed in the WaPo, McRaven actually called John Brennan[1] 'a man of unparalleled integrity, whose honesty and character have never been in question.' It just goes to show that, in both Dem world and D.C. world, 'integrity,' 'honesty,' and 'character' have different meanings than they do in the real world. After all, in the real world, no one would say it shows honesty, integrity, or character to lie repeatedly to Congress, but that's what Brennan did. By the way, I'm not even talking about the most recent go-round of lies. I'm talking about the lies in 2014[2], when Brennan was still living in the wonders of Obama-world. Back then, the lies were wrapped around the illegal activity of the CIA spying on our own government: As reports emerged Thursday[3]that an internal investigation by the Central Intelligence Agency's inspector general found that the CIA 'improperly' spied on US Senate staffers when researching the CIA's dark history of torture, it was hard to conclude anything but the obvious: John Brennan blatantly lied to the American public. Again. 'The facts will come out,' Brennantold NBC News in March[4]after Senator Dianne Feinsteinissued a blistering condemnation of the CIA on the Senate floor[5], accusing his agency of hacking into the computers used by her intelligence committee's staffers. 'Let me assure you the CIA was in no way spying on [the committee] or the Senate,' he said. After the CIA inspector general's report completely contradicted Brennan's statements, it now appears Brennan was forced to privately apologize to intelligence committee chairs ina 'tense' meeting earlier this week[6]. Brennan was so bad that, back in 2014, the same WaPo that now has McRaven leaping to Brennan's defense because Trump yanked Brennan's security clearance, had its own opinions editor (not a guest) demand that Obama fire Brennan[7]: An apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were Brennan or intelligence leaders' first offense, but the track record is far from spotless. In 2011, Brennan claimed that dozens of U.S. drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian. This remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports \u2014 even supporters of the drone program called it 'absurd' \u2014 but asthe Bureau of Investigative Journalism[8]andthe New York Times[9]both reported later, President Obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians. As Obama's top counterterrorism adviser at the time, Brennan would have received these reports as well, so either Brennan knew that his claim was a lie, or he is secretly deaf. Similarly, Brennan denied snooping on Senate computers six weeks after Feinstein first made the accusation to the CIA in private, which means either that he was lying, or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks, then spouted off about it without any real knowledge \u2014 hardly the behavior expected of an agency director. And last year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress when he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and the Senate Intelligence Committee that the National Security Agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of Americans, a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Despite Clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle, the damage to Clapper's and the White House's credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and, well, the fact that lying to Congress is a crime (though one that's difficult to prosecute[10]), Obama has not disciplined Clapper in any way. Brennan is a bad apple and has always been a bad apple, going back to his communist days. Once upon a time, the Left understood this, but Leftists are so infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome that, as many have said, if Trump figured out a way to cure cancer, the Leftists would demand he stop hurting cancer. Oh, and to the extent McRaven, in the WaPo piece, asked to have his security clearance pulled too, I think Trump should oblige him. First, security clearance is a privilege, not a right, and one that operates to benefit the U.S., not the security holder. Which leads me to the second point, which is that McRaven has shown that his years at the Pentagon have warped his values, common sense, and ability to understand the common meaning of words. That's not a good man to possess to valuable a privilege. Anyway who can look at the hysterical, dishonest Brennan and think he's a safe man to trust with a security clearance has proven himself too lacking in sense to have his own clearance. Incidentally, the current crop of lies against Trump don't stop with denying that Brennan lies. Just in case you read the defense of Brennan that he was the point man on the bin Laden raid, he wasn't:#FakeNews[11] MSM is calling Brennan the 'point man on the Bin Laden raid.' He wasn't. He wasn't even working for CIA then. He was WH Homeland Security Advisor. He was simply a non essential body in the Situation Room watching the raid. \u2014 John Cardillo (@johncardillo) August 16, 2018[12]If the Left says something, the rule isn't 'trust but verify.' It's 'don't trust; verify everything.' I'll give the last word on the subject to Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), whoissued a scathing indictment[13] against Brennan and supporting Trump's decision: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bookwormroom.com/2018/08/16/bookworm-beat-8-16-2018-brennan-edition/burr-on-brennan/;\">http://www.bookwormroom.com/2018/08/16/bookworm-beat-8-16-2018-brennan-edition/burr-on-brennan/;</url> Elizabeth Warren doubles down on crony fascism. I've said repeatedly that the difference between communism and fascism, both of which are subsets of statist socialism, is that communism does away with private property while fascism does away with private control over private property. Property can still be 'owned,' with individuals drawing profits, but the government calls the shots. Here in America, when big businesses voluntarily collaborates with government to destroy small businesses (which are less able to bear government regulations), I call it 'crony fascism.' Enter the profoundly stupid, greedy, power-crazed Elizabeth Warren[14]: Under Senator Warren's proposal, no business with more than $1 billion in revenue would be permitted to legally operate without permission from the federal government. The federal government would then dictate to these businesses the composition of their boards, the details of internal corporate governance, compensation practices, personnel policies, and much more. Naturally, their political activities would be restricted, too. Senator Warren's proposal entails the wholesale expropriation of private enterprise in the United States, and nothing less. It is unconstitutional, unethical, immoral, irresponsible, and \u2014 not to put too fine a point on it \u2014 utterly bonkers. More than thirty years ago, I had the dubious pleasure of calling Warren 'Professor Warren.' I disliked and distrusted her then and the years have only solidified those feelings. Not all 'oppressors' are created equal. The IRA was a terrorist organization, but that doesn't do away with the fact that, for centuries, the British really did terrorize the Irish. I'm not just talking about the slaughters (let's not even get into what Cromwell did to the Irish). I'm also talking about economic terrorism. Every time the Irish managed to get some economic enterprise going, the British made it illegal. In that context, Irish Republicanism made sense and their terrorism against civilians had a cruel logic because they lacked the ability to take on the British military directly. The problem for the Irish today is that they now assume all terrorist groups must have at least a little virtue. That's the only explanation I can come up with for their fanatic Hamas support. Joseph Puder details[15] how Ireland has become one of the European countries most hostile to Israel. If the Irish stop and think, they'd realize that just because a group is small and lacks the might to take on a large military, it doesn't mean it's virtuous. The Irish are backing misogynistic, homophobic, anti-Christian, anti-Western, genocidal Palestinian nuts against the only pluralist, free, liberal democracies in the whole God-forsaken, Allah-drenched Middle East. In other words, the Irish knee jerk impulses are stupid and downright evil. If you pay for homeless, you'll get homeless.Yesterday I read a marvelous article that Daniel Greenfield wrote talking about how homelessness isa big business for Democrat run shit-holes[16] (my word, not his). And no, I don't ordinarily use obscenity, but I'm being accurate here. My hometown of San Francisco is now the shittiest city in America, with its streets drowning in fecal matter. Greenfield starts with New York's homeless industry: New York City will bespending $2.06 billion[17]on its Department of Homeless Services. There are61,[18]421[19]homeless people in the city which is spending $33,539 per homeless person. That's only a little short of the starting salary of an FDNY firefighter at $39,000. More money will bespent on the homeless[20]than on the firefighters who save New Yorkers from burning buildings. The FDNY will have to make do with $2.04 billion, and the health department with $1.6 billion. That's impressive for DHS, a department that was only created in 1993 by the disgraced Dinkins administration and is now burning through more cash than agencies fulfilling actual vital city functions. Two years ago, DHShad over[21]2,600 employees. That's 1 employee to every 23 homeless people. Meanwhile 234 New Yorkers get only 1 police officer to serve and protect them from criminals. It's the same for San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C, Portland, and Los Angeles, as Greenfield also details. He then draws the logical conclusion: Social crises justify huge spending and expansions of the government. The homeless crisis is largely a problem in lefty cities where it's heavily subsidized. Federal HUD homeless grants hit $2 billion in 2018.Homelessness statistics often come from the very agencies that are being glutted with cash to fight the problem. Worse still, many of the counts are being carried out by volunteers. Verification is chancy. Billions are being spent on a problem whose growth and scope is being charted by the self-interested.The billions being poured into solving the problem are going everywhere but to the homeless. In Los Angeles, the billions in tax hikes going to build homeless housing are being spent on units thatcost an average[22]of $479,000 per unit. At that rate, it would take $15 billion to house all the homeless. That's 150% of the entire budget. And by then the population would have doubled. The building boom is going on even though Los Angeles County already has plenty of beds in shelters that aren't being used. Anyone who travels downtown can see homeless encampments rising around homeless shelters. More than half of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) shelters aren't filling their beds. The average utilization rate is 78%. The problem isn't a shortage. Homelessness is largely a mental health and drug abuse issue. The issue isn't a lack of housing. But that hasn't stopped cities like Los Angeles and New York from spending billions on housing programs that aren't addressing the core issue of homelessness. But they were never meant to. Homelessness is a manufactured crisis that funnels money to special interests, building up a social welfare sector of the government, while subsidizing and fueling the scale and scope of the problem. That was what I read yesterday. So what happens today? I read an article in theSan Francisco Chroniclethat describes the streets in terms Hieronymus Bosch[23] would recognize and then demands . . . more government[24]: The escape room shares a large building between Sixth and Seventh streets with other businesses. The locked front door, which opens to the street, has a buzzer so employees can let customers inside, but others keep slipping in behind them. Recently there was a knife fight, apparently over a drug deal gone bad, in the hallway. Sometimes every bathroom stall is occupied by transients or injection drug users, who regularly leave dirty needles and soiled clothing behind. There's a stubborn urine stain on the carpet. Outside on Stevenson Street, a tucked-away alley running alongside the building, injection drug users congregate, discarding dirty needles and trash. [snip] In this insanely rich city with an annual budget of $11 billion[25], where is the money for more shelter beds, more sobering centers, more drug rehabilitation programs and far more treatment beds for the mentally ill? The article's author, Heather Knight, might want to brush up on Field of Dreams: 'If you build it, they will come.' If you want more homeless, give them more infrastructure at the expense of your taxpaying citizens. 'Get Trump' is the only value the Left has. I haven't commented on the print media's decision on Thursday to run anti-Trump editorials. The obvious point everyone made is that, to the extent Trump has been alleging that the media is colluding against him, this kind of proves it, right? The other point is that there's nothing special about this collusion. The reality since November 2016 is that the media runs anti-Trump editorials (and *ahem* news stories) every day. The media has abandoned news entirely. In a sane environment, the media would report about domestic and foreignfacts,leaving readers to draw their own conclusions about whether the president is serving this nation well. Instead, the media has become nothing more than a collective gossip column, endlessly retelling meaningless tidbits about 'Trump did this' and 'Trump said that.' In that regard, the Rome (NY) Sentinel wrote a quite amazing editorial[26] about the stupid and distasteful First Amendment theater in which the press engages. I urge you to read the whole thing, but I especially wanted to bring your attention to this language: The media misdirect attention to the First Amendment rather than hold themselves accountable for reporting often wrong, misleading, or incomplete. They choose loaded words, add phrases, insert catty remarks, and bury ledes. We know. We edit such copy every day. The president doesn't 'slap' on tariffs; he imposes them. He doesn't 'slash' budgets; he reduces them. We edit out Improvised Editorial Devices (IEDs) that have no place in journalism, like the clause 'Ever the showman' designed to shape the mental battlefield. We rearrange copy to focus on what is significant, not salacious. We ignore petty subjects they favor and request coverage of significant ones they overlook. A journalist is only as good as the last story written, and journalists should approach subjects with a full set of skills and little baggage. That's hard to do when some are paid by news sources, fed rumors by unnamed sources, or personally involved with those about whom they report. Quality news articles should be as accurate and complete as a nautical chart. To navigate into port, no sea captain would trust a chart that inserted non-existent shoals or omitted real ones. Media that buy into this drama are greater fools than they take us to be. The problem grew epidemic as casualness marched though our institutions over the last decades. Schools, government, the press and other promote lack of accountability through complexity, centralization, double standards, and lack of sunshine. True journalism is a dying art. Rome, NY might be its last bastion. Journalists think their relationship with Trump is the story; they're wrong.Part of the problem with the media's abysmal reporting is that, while Americans want to read about the economy, and law and crime, and technology, and human interest, and international matters, reporters want to talk about themselves. They haven't figured out it's not news if we're just invited to read their Middle School Diary: 'Dear Diary, Donald Trump was mean to me today. I hate him. I'm going to make him suffer!' Not news. It's just immature, self-centered whining. Lee Smith points out something important[27], which is that the real news isn't Trump's verbal jabs at the media, jabs that are totally within Trump's purview as a free citizen in our constitutional republic. The real story is that the media acted stupidly with the rise of the internet and is now at the mercy of Big Tech (which it stupidly cheers on): But the fact that the same journalists were unable or unwilling to raise their voices in unison when theObama administration[28]put their colleagues under surveillance, and used the Espionage Act toprosecute sources[29], suggests that the issue isn't Trump's unique hostility toward the press. Whether the media's activist stance is good for journalism's bottom line remains an open question. Probably not. And given the sinking fortunes of media giants like Conde Nast, the media's financial situation appears hopeless. Why, consider theBoston Globe. In 1992 theNew York Timesbought the Globe for $1.1 billion, the highest price ever paid for a newspaper. In 2013, the Timessold it for $70 million.[30]That's a 93 percent loss over 20 years. What happened? Corporate mismanagement is partly to blame. With the rise of the internet, the Times spent nearly a decade incapable of deciding whether to charge for news or give it away for free. The hope was that digital advertising would eventually make up for the calamitous decline in print advertising. The result was that media companies, spearheaded by the industry-leading Times, devalued their product\u2014information. Worse was that when someone did figure out how to make money from media online, it wasn't the trusted news sources, it was social media. Newcomers like Facebook and Google had a huge advantage over the prestige press. Not only did they not have to pay their content providers, they were also exempt from press liabilities and responsibilities. Tech-optimists like Ron Wyden, then-congressman from Oregon and now senator, wrote it into the law. Read the whole thing. It's worth your time. Did feminists get a policeman committed to life in jail for the crime of being . . . a man?Until I read the article in Townhall[31], I'd never heard of Officer Daniel Holtzclaw, an Oklahoma police officer convicted for having assaulted women while on the job. According to the Townhall article, which relies on Michelle Malkin's meticulous research[32], feminist police officers, eventually joined by BLM activists, took a complete lack of evidence, puffed it up into smoke, and sent an honest man to prison. If true, it's a completely un-American travesty and nightmare ginned up by the evil anti-male, anti-police, anti-white (although Holtzclaw is part Asian) Left. You can learn more by reading the linked articles and you can check out the Change.org petition[33].; Does Trump have a plan for November? I hope this is true, but I'm not banking on it. I'm banking on you \u2014 and you and you and you \u2014 to get out and vote.1/ A thread on how Trump will ensure Republicans hold the House in 2018. I say how because it's as much about the operational and tactical as it is about the message. The special elections are over and Republicans won 8/9.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/nU7kqc9kOm\">https://t.co/nU7kqc9kOm</url>[34] \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[35] 2/ 89% is a pretty good percentage considering how much money, time, energy and significance that Democrats invested in each of these races.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/wdyisYi7X5\">https://t.co/wdyisYi7X5</url>[36] \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[37] 3/ It's not just about the percentage.

Rallies! \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[38] 4/ Trump stalks a race. Waits to the right moment. Targets the perfect location to energize the key area.

Well to understand that you have to remember what Trump pulled of in November 2016. He held 14 rallies in 3 days in MI, NH, PA, NC, FL, VA, MN, IA, CO .... He won 5/10. Made some very close.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/gYwoiZrZjs\">https://t.co/gYwoiZrZjs</url>[43] \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[44] 7/ But this is 2018. Trump is in charge, runs the RNC. No Republican running is in open revolt. Trump has the highest party approval ever, an economy humming at 3%+, low unemployment and a booming stock market. He's had time to perfect the strategy. That turns 5/10 into 8/9. \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[45] 8/ So beyond the strategy and operational advantage the Republicans have a huge policy/message advantage. They have more accomplishments to sell and more outcomes at stake than the Democrats. 'Resist' is destined to fail.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/xaM2NbUYUd\">https://t.co/xaM2NbUYUd</url>[46] \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[47] 9/ And, yes, they know they are defying history. They know it's an uphill climb. They realize they are being asked to climb Everest but they are confident. Why? Because they're prepared. They have a plan.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/N3Ky6Ssxma\">https://t.co/N3Ky6Ssxma</url>[48] \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[49] 10/ What's the plan? Pick 15 seats across the country where the race is tight and Democrats hold a narrow advantage. Pinpoint a perfect location for a Trump rally. Energize the Trump base to turn out. Snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Simple really. If you have Trump. /end \u2014 The Reckoning (@sethjlevy) August 15, 2018[50]A movie about one of the worst American mass murderers comes to the screen. If one is being honest, no matter how one feels about abortion, the reality is that Kermit Gosnell had every hallmark of a serial killer. This was a man who ran a charnel house in which women died and in which he took a sick pleasure in personally severing the spines of fully formed babies . . . and then keeping their bodies as souvenirs. That's not a medical procedure, that's psychopathy. Despite tremendous difficulty, committed conservatives in Hollywood have managed to bring a movie about Gosnell to fruition: Play Video[51]I've liked Dean Cain every since I watched Lois and Clark : The New Adventures of Superman on late night TV when my pregnancy and then a crying baby kept me up all night.

Today that threat seems empty. Even as regulators discuss new rules and activists fret about the right to privacy, the shares of the five biggest American tech firms have been on a jaw-dropping bull run over the past 12 months, rising by 52 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The increase in the firms' combined value of almost $US2 trillion is hard to get your head around: it is roughly equivalent to Germany's entire stockmarket. Four of the five - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft - are each now worth over $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion). (Facebook is worth a mere $US620bn.) For all the talk of a tech-lash, fund managers in Boston, London and Singapore have shrugged and moved on. Their calculus is that nothing can stop these firms, which are destined to earn untold riches.</p><p>This surge in tech giants' share prices raises two worries. One is whether investors have stoked a speculative bubble. The five firms, worth $US5.6 trillion, make up almost a fifth of the value of the S&amp;P 500 index of American shares. The last time the market was so concentrated was 20 years ago, before a crash that triggered a widespread downturn. The other, opposite concern is that investors may be right. The big tech firms' super-sized valuations suggest their profits will double or so in the next decade, causing far greater economic tremors in rich countries and an alarming con-centration of economic and political power.</p><p>Bubble question The question of a bubble is a reasonable one. Tech cycles are an integral part of the modern economy. The 1980s saw a semiconductor boom. Then, in the 1990s, came PCs and the internet. Each cycle fades or ends in a bust.</p><p>Today's upswing got going in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone. By 2018 it, too, seemed to be showing its age. Sales of smartphones were stagnating. Data scandals at Facebook crystallised anger about the tech giants' flippant approach to privacy. Global antitrust regulators were on the alert. And the loss-making antics of flaky tech \"unicorns\" such as Uber and WeWork evoked the kind of speculative froth often seen at the tail end of a long boom.</p><p>In fact, at least for the biggest tech giants, today's valuations are built on more solid foundations. Together, the five biggest firms have cranked out $US178bn of cashflow after investment in the past 12 months. Their size has yet to slow their expansion: their median sales growth of 17 per cent in the latest quarter is still as impressive as it was five years ago.</p><p>Consumers say they care about privacy but act as if they care much more about getting stuff, and preferably without having to pay for it in cash. Since the end of 2018 the number of people using Facebook's services (including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) has risen by 11 per cent to 2.3 billion. Regulators have punished tech firms for tax, privacy and competition misconduct, but so far their efforts have been like bringing a peashooter to a gun fight: the fines and penalties they have imposed amount to less than 1 per cent of the big five's market value, a tolerable cost of doing business. And the agonies of some of the unicorns, and their biggest backer, SoftBank, have only demonstrated how hard it is to replicate the scale and network effects of the big five.</p><p>Meanwhile, the size of the opportunity is vast, with many parts of the economy yet to digitise. In the West only a tenth of retail sales are online, and perhaps a fifth of computing workloads sit in the cloud with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Big tech operates globally, giving it more space to expand, especially in emerging economies where spending on digital technology is still relatively low.</p><p>Storm brewing The trouble is that if you think that tech firms will get much bigger and diversify into more industries, from healthcare to agriculture, it is logical to assume that the backlash against them will not fade away but, eventually, get bigger.</p><p>As Big Tech's scope expands, more non-tech firms will find their profits dented and more workers will see their livelihoods disrupted, creating angry constituencies. One crude measure of scale is to look at global profits relative to American GDP. By this yardstick, Apple, which is expanding into services, is already roughly as big as Standard Oil and US Steel were in 1910, at the height of their powers. Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are set to reach the threshold within the next 10 years.</p><p>Resentments When recession strikes it will fuel new resentments. Big Tech could face a storm that few have yet paid much attention to. The big five firms employ 1.2 million people and are now by far the biggest investors in corporate America, spending almost $US200bn a year. Their decisions about whether to squeeze suppliers, slash investment or attack weaker rivals will prove as controversial as those of carmakers when Detroit still ruled in the 1970s, or even of Wall Street in 2007-08. Big tech's role in politics is already toxic; social media and videos influence elections from Minnesota to Myanmar.</p><p>All this means that, far from having peaked, anger may be in the foothills. Executives hope that slick lobbying will protect them. But even today, the picture outside America is not of inaction but a tumult of regulatory experiments. China keeps its internet giants under tacit state control and wants to rely less on Silicon Valley, including Apple, which is already dealing with the corona-virus and other headwinds there. At least 27 countries have or are considering digital taxes.</p><p>India has cracked down on e-commerce and online speech. The European Union wants individuals to own and control their own data, although it may take years of innovation to create a system that is easy for consumers to use and profit from.</p><p>This week the EU proposed curbs on artificial intelligence. Even in America, trustbusters may limit Big Tech's ability to gobble up start-ups, a strategy which has been instrumental to the success of Alphabet and Facebook in particular.</p><p>The harder they fall The $US5.6 trillion market value of tech's formidable five is a testament to some of the most commercially successful companies ever created.But it also assumes that they will get a lot bigger even as the world stands by and watches placidly. Until today, Big Tech has been largely unscathed. The bigger it becomes, the more reason there is to doubt this can continue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-746b3444546211eabb3591c596b45b392fc1ac8aa8fb3fa7264ed7a2e5f6449d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y86-F5G1-JD3N-554T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 22, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Murrow of far-right tinfoil-hat crankery, had been booted from Facebook, YouTube, Apple and Spotify, potentially limiting his access to his massive following.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is this a welcome move by private corporations to refuse to provide a platform for toxic garbage, or a disturbing step toward censorship of unpopular expression? While cries that Jones' banishment is a terrifying assault on speech are ludicrously over the top, the actions of the tech companies do point to some real causes for concern.</p><p>To state the obvious: There are no constitutional issues involved, since the First Amendment protects speech only from intervention by the government. Some, including Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), have argued that since today's big tech companies wield virtual monopoly power in the marketplace, they should be treated as public utilities when it comes to speech - an ironic stance that puts conservatives in the position of calling for more government regulation.</p><p>Meanwhile, free-speech champions such as attorney and blogger Ken White warn that any attempt to treat social media platforms as \"public forums\" where First Amendment principles should govern will lead to pernicious government intrusion.</p><p>However, it is true that the social media giants present themselves as a marketplace of ideas with universal access - except for speech deemed hateful or abusive. And it is true that a handful of corporations could cut off someone's access to major audiences and eliminate his or her livelihood.</p><p>So far, this has not happened to Jones. While his Facebook page and YouTube channel have been shut down, and Apple has removed most of his podcasts, he is still on Twitter, and his website, InfoWars, not only exists but shows up in Google Search results (undercutting claims that he was the target of a concerted effort to scrub him from the internet). Arguably, the halo of persecution may at least temporarily drive up the interest in his fare. And Jones also has a nationally available radio show.</p><p>But what if Jones was subjected to a more radical deplatforming - and what if it was the start of a slippery slope? At least one politician, Rep. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), seemed to advocate exactly that, tweeting that \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies,\" and that sites like Facebook and YouTube \"must do more than take down one website.\"</p><p>When calls for Internet companies to restrict objectionable speech turn into political pressure, it should be worrying even to those who shed no tears for Jones.</p><p>Another cause for concern is that, while Jones is widely despised for peddling conspiratorial smears (for instance, that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and the parents of the murdered children are \"crisis actors,\" or that Hillary Clinton and her top advisers ran a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant), the stated reason for the ban on his content is not defamation but \"hate speech\" against Muslims, transgender people and other groups. Yet hate speech can be defined very broadly. For many on the left, it includes questioning whether children who identify as transgender should get hormone treatments before puberty, or criticizing Islamic doctrines that arguably promote misogyny and intolerance.  Given that the tech companies generally espouse a culturally progressive ethos, it is not unreasonable to think that a wide range of supposedly hateful views may be subject to exclusion.</p><p>For some right-wing Twitter users, InfoWars is \"the canary in the coal mine\" - a way for the powers that be to test the waters before they start silencing \"anyone to the right of Marx.\" Such panic looks ridiculous given the prominence of Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting in the media market. It is also largely about partisanship, not principle; it's a good bet that many Jones defenders are among the large minority of Republicans who, according to a new poll, want the government to shut down liberal media organizations. But just because so much of the reaction to Jones's banning is paranoid and hypocritical doesn't invalidate the real issues raised by this incident.</p><p>What happens if the Jones purge is followed by a more far-reaching ideological crackdown - targeting, for example, sites like Breitbart or The Federalist? The likely result will not be to silence the right, but to fracture the internet. Disaffected conservatives will build and migrate to their own internet service providers, search engines, video hosting companies and social media platforms. Culture will become even more polarized, with fewer spaces where people from different political \"tribes\" interact and with more echo chambers that foster extremism. This is a future none of us should want.</p><p>The tech companies are well within their rights to ban offensive content. But they should tread carefully.</p><p>Columnist</p><p>USA TODAY NETWORK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRESUN-bng-1987362608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRESUN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1D-0CJ1-DYJJ-P03G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257492</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Press &amp;

Murrow of far-right tinfoil-hat crankery, had been booted from Facebook, YouTube, Apple and Spotify, potentially limiting his access to his massive following. Is this a welcome move by private corporations to refuse to provide a platform for toxic garbage, or a disturbing step toward censorship of unpopular expression? While cries that Jones' banishment is a terrifying assault on speech are ludicrously over the top, the actions of the tech companies do point to some real causes for concern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To state the obvious: There are no constitutional issues involved, since the First Amendment protects speech only from intervention by the government. Some, including Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), have argued that since today's big tech companies wield virtual monopoly power in the marketplace, they should be treated as public utilities when it comes to speech - an ironic stance that puts conservatives in the position of calling for more government regulation. Meanwhile, free speech champions such as attorney and blogger Ken White warn that any attempt to treat social media platforms as \"public forums\" where First Amendment principles should govern will lead to pernicious government intrusion.</p><p>Social media hasn't cut Jones off completely</p><p>However, it is true that the social media giants present themselves as a marketplace of ideas with universal access - except for speech deemed hateful or abusive. And it is true that a handful of corporations could cut off someone's access to major audiences and eliminate his or her livelihood.</p><p>So far, this has not happened to Jones. While his Facebook page and YouTube channel have been shut down and Apple has removed most of his podcasts, he is still on Twitter, and his website, InfoWars, not only exists but shows up in Google Search results (undercutting claims that he was the target of a concerted effort to scrub him from the internet). Arguably, the halo of persecution may at least temporarily drive up the interest in his fare. And Jones also has a nationally available radio show.</p><p>But what if Jones was subjected to a more radical deplatforming - and what if it was the start of a slippery slope? At least one politician, Rep. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), seemed to advocate exactly that, tweeting that \"Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies\" and that sites like Facebook and YouTube \"must do more than take down one website.\"</p><p>When calls for internet companies to restrict objectionable speech turn into political pressure, it should be worrying even to those who shed no tears for Jones.</p><p>Another cause for concern is that, while Jones is widely despised for peddling conspiratorial smears (for instance, that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and the parents of the murdered children are \"crisis actors,\" or that Hillary Clinton and her top advisors ran a child sex trafficking ring out of a Washington, DC pizza restaurant), the stated reason for the ban on his content is not defamation but \"hate speech\" against Muslims, transgender people, and other groups.</p><p>Defining hate speech is dangerous waters</p><p>Yet hate speech can be defined very broadly. For many on the left, it includes questioning whether children who identify as transgender should get hormone treatments before puberty, or criticizing Islamic doctrines that arguably promote misogyny and intolerance. Accusations of \"hate\" have been leveled at Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz and award-winning atheist philosopher, neuroscientist and podcaster Sam Harris. Given that the tech companies generally espouse a culturally progressive ethos, it is not unreasonable to think that a wide range of supposedly hateful views may be subject to exclusion.</p><p>For some right-wing Twitter users, InfoWars is \"the canary in the coal mine\" - a way for the powers that be to test the waters before they start silencing \"anyone to the right of Marx.\" Such panic looks ridiculous given the prominence of Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting in the media market. It is also largely about partisanship, not principle; it's a good bet that many Jones defenders are among the large minority of Republicans who, according to a new poll, want the government to shut down liberal media organizations. But just because so much of the reaction to Jones's banning is paranoid and hypocritical doesn't invalidate the real issues raised by this incident.</p><p>What happens if the Jones purge is followed by a more far-reaching ideological crackdown - targeting, for example, sites like Breitbart or The Federalist? The likely result will not be to silence the right, but to fracture the internet. Disaffected conservatives will build and migrate to their own internet service providers, search engines, video hosting companies and social media platforms. Culture will become even more polarized, with fewer spaces where people from different political \"tribes\" interact and with more echo chambers that foster extremism. This is a future none of us should want. The tech companies are well within their rights to ban offensive content. But they should tread carefully.</p><p>Cathy Young is a columnist at Newsday, a contributing writer at \"The Forward\" and a contributing editor at \"Reason.\" Follow her on Twitter: @CathyYoung63</p><p>Your Turn</p><p>Cathy Young</p><p>Guest columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Alex Jones near the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Brian Blanco/epa-EFE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TALDEM-tal-1986654596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TALDEM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0S-3P61-JC3H-04FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247839</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Tallahassee Democrat All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tallahassee Democrat (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 10, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Doing something slightly different. I'm Jon Raviv. I cover aerospace and defense for Citigroup. We're honored today to have this afternoon Booz Allen Hamilton's CEO, Horacio Rozanski; and CFO, Lloyd Howell, joining us. </p><p>Booz Allen Hamiltonis one of several companies that is in the government services space, providing a lot of mission-critical type technologies and other services to a variety of government customers. I'll let them -- while the CEO go into more detail, but I just think the concept is being that the government also has technology requirements and there are companies out there who are uniquely suited to addressing those technology requirements, and thus, Booz Allenis here at the CitiTech Conference. So thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'm going to toss it over to Horacio to give a couple of brief minutes on what's going on, what you're seeing. But then, we'll just have general Q&amp;A. So feel free that I can run, but feel free to raise your hand and butt in any time, push to talk on the microphone. I think I don't -- I don't think I have forgotten anything. So with that, I'll hand it over to Horacio. Thank you, Horacio.</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON HOLDING CORPORATION: Thanks, Jon, and good afternoon, everyone. I -- we're eager to answer your questions and not hear ourselves talk. So I will give you a couple of highlights from Booz Allenjust to ground anybody who's new to the story, talk a little bit about our investment thesis and then launch us into Q&amp;A.</p><p>So if you know Booz Allen, we've been around since 1914. We started serving the United States federal government in 1940 by helping the Navy get ready for World War II, and we have been serving the Navy ever since. We have served -- we now are a $6.2 billion firm, roughly 40 -- 24,000-plus employees spread all over the states and many other countries. About 97% of our work is for the federal government and the remaining 3% is for, what we call, global commercial, which is the private sector in the United States as well as private and public sector clients in selected places around the world. I have been in this job for about 3.5 years. About 6 years ago, when I was a Chief Operating Officer, we launched a strategy, which at that time we thought we were very clever by calling it Vision 2020. If you read the Wall Street Journal, apparently everybody else called their strategy Vision 2020 as well, but at least we did it in 2012.</p><p>The core of that strategy was to get us closer to our clients' missions, to increase the technical content of our work, to double down on innovating and expanding our capabilities at the leading edge of technology and to reenter the commercial market, which we have exited when we did a -- when we spun off that business as part of the transaction with Carlyle in 2008. Happy to say, Vision 2020 has been very successful for us as a strategy. The business is growing and performing very well. And last June, we had an Investor Day where we laid out our investment thesis and parameters for the next 3 years. And if I may, the thesis have 3 parts. The first one is that in a market that now signals demand, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture upside. Because of the investments we made in Vision 2020, because of the way we are positioned and because of our operating model, we believe we will outgrow and outpace the market consistently, which is also consistent with the last couple of decades of Booz Allenhistory.</p><p>Second is that, financially we can deliver for our investors over the next 3 years a 50% increase in ADEPS going from about $2 last fiscal year to about $3 by the end of a 3-year period through a combination of top line growth organically in the 6% to 9% range, 10 to 30 bps of margin improvement over this time period and deploying about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of both ordinary dividends and possibly share repurchases or other vehicles to deploy effectively capital back to our shareholders.</p><p>And then the last thing is that because of the investments and because of the work that we're doing, the Booz Allenstory of growth and opportunity extends beyond the 3-year horizon by, what we call, option value, which, in our way of thinking, is the ability to take some of the intellectual capital that now sits inside our business and monetize it in new and different ways by building businesses that are not necessarily labor-based but that take advantage of what we have learned to do for the government and drive it into new and exciting footprints. We talked at Investor Day about investments we're making in artificial intelligence in work for the federal government that will expand. Beyond that work, we're doing in directed energy that has opportunities to monetize. Work we're doing even with the park services around reservation systems that create different business models to capture value. Those numbers, if and when they pay off, will pay off outside of this 3-year period. And because we cannot exactly quantify them, we talked to them about really, \"This is the option you buy on top of the base value of our business if you own the name.\" So that's, in general, where we are and what we're seeing. I think I've stuck to the 5-minute mark as we discussed. So Jon, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: Even slightly less. Again, anyone should feel free, just raise your hand, I can call on you. But one thing I wanted to capture here, I know the future is very important, but I think understanding a little bit of the past is also relevant here, especially with Vision 2020. Can you talk about some of the changes or the evolution of the company that you've undergone in the past -- during your new tenure here because I think it's important the sort of way you pivoted to address what the government wants today versus what they wanted 5, 6, 10, whatever years ago?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: So if you look at our market, our market has gone through 2 significant periods of change and is now entering a third one. There was a significant uptick of funding to the entire federal government post 9/11. And in that market, the entire business grew, the entire industry grew, and obviously, we grew as well. A lot of the work that grew at that point for us was work around program management, around outsourcing, around intelligence analysis and around the support of the country through those conflicts. The second period came, call it, around 2012, 2013 in the form of sequestration, where there was a significant drawdown of budgets and not just that but a tremendous period of uncertainty for all of our clients, where, frankly, they didn't know what their mission was going to be, whether they were going to be funded and open for business the next day, and be paralyzed in lots of ways the functioning of our government, but certainly the functioning of the interaction between government and our sector. And then started really over the last couple of years is a period of greater stability, greater certainty in the -- for our clients in terms of what their missions are and how they're going to accomplish them, and in the last 18 months, an increase in funding that accompanies that, which signals the opportunity to invest in capabilities that our clients have long wanted to implement, moving significant portions of their active structure to the cloud, for example, implementing mobile platforms that our clients understood the value that they had to the private sector and the value they could have to their mission, simply they were not funded, didn't have the resources to go after that. And what we're seeing now is a period where the resources are there and a real run towards making those upgrades and modernizing those footprints. In that context, around 2012 and coming off a long period of expansion for the firm, we sat back in this process of, what we call, Vision 2020 to say, \"Okay, the market of the future is not going to be like the market of the past.\" And the notion that because we are a very well-respected consulting firm with long and deep footprint in the government isn't going to be sufficient as the basis for competition and differentiation for us in the future. And so we begun to invest in an innovation agenda that has taken our business to a different place and in building much more technical content for our work, so that we could be more relevant to transforming the missions of the future. Take an example, work we do with Veterans Affairs, that has greatly helped decrease the number of -- the backlog of claims for veterans because we have taken a number of their aging infrastructure pieces into the digital domain with completely different dynamics and a much greater ability to serve those customers. Work that we do for the IRS around helping not just with the tax return part of the mission but with actual fraud detection in tax returns. I'd like to tell the story that my own return was hacked a few years ago, and the IRS caught it and did not issue a refund to a bad actor. And I'd like to think that somewhere in there, Booz Allensystem and algorithm was part of preventing that problem. That's the firm that we are now, a firm that lives at the intersection of these core missions and the application of technology to create value to the mission, both technologies that are today in broad applicability and broad use across the private and public sector, like Agile development, like I said, like mobile, like cyber, like data science, and technologies that are just coming into being, like blockchain, like cyber on the IoT side, and AI and so forth.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: Guys want to pick you up on that one. I think one interesting program that you all talked about on the last conference call, and I think you've talked about sort of individual capabilities as the conference calls go on, but I think the one thing from the last one was a program that seems to be the forefront of artificial-intelligence-type implementation at the Defense Department. And perhaps it's surprising -- well, maybe not surprising at all that the defense department for as strong and large as it just simply doesn't do certain things, but now they're starting to do certain things. What are those? Can you give us a sense for what those sorts of things are? And how it represents a new almost market for you all?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: So the reality is DoD has been at the forefront of innovation and experimentation for this country for the past 40 or 50 years. The Internet was conceived at DARPA, and this is not something DoD doesn't do. But for the past few years, they've been in a position where they didn't have the resources to get beyond the pilot and the basic experimentation into broad application of some of these technologies. So the program, Jon, that you're talking about is the program where we're working with the defense department to first build the architecture and then the technology platforms so that very broad and different streams of data can be brought together so that you can build actual neural networks and deep learning algorithms in order to accelerate the sifting of that information and collecting of that information so that it can be used operationally. Imagine a group of soldiers down the field and an analyst trying to figure out by reading reports and seeing sensor data from different types of sensors, real time, \"What do I tell these people is in front of them? And where might the enemy be? And what do they need to worry about?\" We are now in a position to begin to build those capabilities at scale. We're not the only ones doing that, but in our sector, we believe we are further ahead than anybody.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Just to that point, I mean, if you look at some of your competitors and a lot of them also seem to be moving down the technology path, so how we should look and can compare like versus Leidos and Perspecta? How do you differentiate yourselves when it comes to technology and providing cybersecurity solutions, et cetera, like if I look at you and try to explain someone what makes you different?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: So I think I would say 2 things. One is, in a couple of specific areas, I do believe that because we got started sooner or we've been investing for much longer, our capabilities are that much further ahead. We started doing cybersecurity in the intelligence community in the mid-90s before cyber was a thing. And that -- we have learned and created a depth of knowledge and of relationship and capability there that will be hard for others to reconstruct. We started -- we built a, what we call, the Strategic Innovation Group, which is roughly a couple of thousand of our colleagues focused on driving these new capabilities into the market 6 years ago, long before even the defense department started talking about innovation, long before DIUX came into play. So we have been getting ahead of that in ways that have allowed us to just the time to build those capabilities to a different level. More importantly, though, because of our consulting heritage, we are not into deploying technology, we are into creating value from that technology. So a lot of the work that we do and where we are most effective or most differentiated is when we bring together 3 things. One is the deep mission knowledge that comes from professionals who have served those clients and have actually at times been those clients, going back not years but decades. And so they really understand the problem set, and they really understand the solution, and they understand the barriers to adoption. Two is, we do bring unique technical capabilities, usually fused together as opposed to as individual offerings because one of the things our operating model allows us to do is to pull from different parts of the organization very quickly to solve problems. And three, we have the consulting process that starts with defining the strategy and ends with the change management approach that actually creates value from deploying that technology as opposed to saying, \"Hey, here's a cool new tool. Hope you can see something in it that others can't see.\" We go all the way to the value creation point, and that makes the relationships more enduring, the opportunity higher and the work more valuable, which is why our win rates are what they are, which is why we have outgrown our peer set and our market going back, really, a couple of decades.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: I'll pick up there on the idea of outgrowth. The outgrowth has been notable and continues to be notable versus your peer set. And I think one of the things that you all have -- someone will ask, why are you doing this? And one of the words that comes up is unique positioning. And I think it's relevant to understand and you just brought this up, is that the unique positioning isn't specifically -- isn't specific to a customer, it's specific to a capability. So can you explain how the business is structured to enable that sharing across -- cross-capabilities that quickly and that flexibly?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: So the core of our differentiation from an operating model perspective is the notion that we have one P&amp;L. This goes back to operating asset partnership back when we were a partnership and retaining that ethos even to this day. So all of the senior people at Booz Allen, which we internally still call partners, are compensated on essentially the same bonus pool, which is tied exclusively to the performance of the entire firm. What that does for me in my job is I can arrange for amassing of resources against a new opportunity or redistributing of resources against existing opportunities real time. What can take a more traditional organization weeks to do, we can do in an afternoon, not necessarily because we're any smarter or we work any harder but because we don't have any of the barriers to get it done. I can take resources from one part of the business and apply them to another without having to restructure everybody else's incentives, metrics, bonuses or anything. We simply just go. And that has allowed us the opportunity to bring really novel thinking to the government. And people think of the government as a client. It's a market made up of lots of different clients with lots of different understandings in different places in their own life cycle. So what is new to the department of x has been an implementation for 10 years in the department of y and the fact that we have done it in one place and can bring it to the other and can bring the people that have done it so seamlessly, frankly, gives us speed to market. In a market that is as turbulent as the government market has been over the last decade, that has been a real source of advantage for us because agendas change very rapidly, priorities change rapidly, funding changes rapidly and you need to be able to adapt and change your resources around, again, almost real time and without -- and we have a lot of advantages to do that. I'm not saying that it's perfect or that we get it right all the time because that would be hubris, but I -- we have inherent advantages in the way we're structured to get that done.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: On the way to this 3-year target, there's the sales side of the equation and you talked about 6% to 9% CAGR over that period. There's also the margin side of the equation. And I think you guys -- I mean, first of all, I'll pull back and just say -- or just prompt you to talk about how you change -- how you're thinking about messaging on the investment thesis these days in terms of what -- thinking about how Booz Allen's quarterly results fit into a longer-term path? And why that was an important thing for you all to achieve in terms of shaping that conversation?</p><p>LLOYD W. HOWELL, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON HOLDING CORPORATION: Sure. I've been in this role for a little over 2 years, and I grew up on our client-facing side. So I don't really come into the role as much as from an accounting perspective as I do from a client competitive business planning perspective. So one of the things that I was struck by is the conversation we were having with our investors was different than the conversation that we had about the business internally. And Horacio and I said about the business of how do we begin to converge the 2 conversations. And what we discovered is it really starts with how we plan the business. So in early June, we laid out a 3-year financial objective profile that Horacio talked to, which is really based upon how we plan the business. Our account leadership looks at what's before them, the opportunity set, the whitespace, the competitive landscape and then they put forward their best thinking about what to do. We made a commitment on, to your question, Jon, in early June, as to why we felt we could achieve that. And it's really because we pick it up from the trenches and we see what's out there and then we go forward. The challenge with or the opportunity with achieving that is, if you look at our performance and our backlog, all the demand indicators give us a lot of confidence that we're not demand-constrained at all. The challenge particularly in this job market is we better recruit the talent especially with the skill sets that are in high demand, not only by our sector but by many industries. Sourcing and recruiting that talent really helps us to convert the backlog and go forward. Now last year, we added over 1,300 people to the business. At Q1, we were up year-over-year by about 5%, and we're likely to have a similar hiring pattern to what we had last fiscal year. So that gives us even additional confidence about achieving our intended investment thesis and the objectives. With just one quarter under our belt and given that it was a strong quarter, naturally, we got a lot of questions about are you going to make an adjustment? And 1 quarter into a 3-year journey is not, I think, bode for start making adjustments on the fly. But we're off to a great start, and it gives us a lot of confidence that we have finally been able to marry the 2 stakeholders in terms of our internal operators as well as our investment base. And now a lot of the questions that we get are consistent with that investment thesis, whether it's, \"Can you do a little bit better? Or where you'll end up in the range? And what would contribute to 10 versus 30 basis points of improvement.\" Now we feel that we've got at least the framework to have that discussion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Sorry. I'm not familiar with the story, but I mean there a lot of big tech companies here that are talking about organizing themselves, not along product lines but along solutions with their own consulting and engineers to provide sort of bespoke solutions. I just kind of wonder what it is which kind of ultimately differentiates? Is it your trusted -- your long-term trusted partner status with the government and federal agencies. Presumably, you're taking other people's solutions -- technical solutions and deploying them. So how does that work medium term?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: I think you have it right. I think, first of all, we are unique in the depth and breadth of our understanding of our clients and of their missions and the amount of time we have spent in there. But we pair that with this operating model that is really meant to integrate things and to fuse things together. And I know a lot of people talk about that and lot of people think about that. We've been doing that for the vast majority -- I've been with Booz Allenfor 26 years. We've been doing that for 20 of the 26 years, and we have now, to some degree, perfected that to a science. And so we are extraordinarily capable at taking technology solutions, whether we develop them, whether we act in partnership with someone else or whether we recommend somebody else's technology solution and bring it in into clients to create no-kidding value. And at least, in our sector, where there are significant barriers to entry do it at scale, in terms of the regulatory requirements, in terms of the accounting requirements, in terms of clearances, in terms of actual access to these programs, that gives us a degree of uniqueness that frankly others don't have. We are not going to compete -- if we go head-to-head with a technology company purely on technology, there may be a couple of areas like cybersecurity where we may actually have more. But in many of those areas, we are not going to be able to differentiate ourselves. So that's not what we're trying to do. We're not trying to say we know more about cloud and the cloud providers that we know more about anything than anybody. We are trying to say on some of these areas we do, but on the majority, it is the ability to fuse these things together with a real understanding of the mission in order to create value inside that mission. That is particularly important if you think about it from the government's perspective because there's a real price to pay if you're a senior government official for getting enamored with a shiny object that doesn't create value in terms of the oversight that they're under and being able to demonstrate that they've done all of this and it created value. It's not just I took my systems to the cloud -- it is I took my systems to the cloud and I accomplished x because otherwise, this becomes a discussion have I wasted a lot of taxpayers' money, which typically ends up on C-SPAN or on TV somewhere. So the ability to reliably create value is what we're after, and it's the core of what Booz Allenhas been about, frankly, certainly since 1940.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I heard you loud and clear, and I appreciate your comment on the demand side. I'm just thinking, in terms of all the geopolitical pressures right now, given the preponderance for a large chunk of your revenue base coming out of the Navy. The Navy is focused -- the Navy is concerned about Russian expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean. We know where the concerns lie or come from in the South Pacific. Given all of those threats, real or potential, at the moment, what do you sort of see as perhaps further uses of your services as your product portfolio, service offerings stand today? And how proactive are you with the DoD, generally, Navy, specifically, in terms of down the road potential further offerings?</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: Very. So just to give you a sense of our portfolio because I don't know that I covered this early on, as I said, 97% of our work is with the federal government. If you took that, half of it is with DoD, rough terms; about 1/4 is with the intelligence community; about 1/4 is with the civilian agencies. So we are very broad based. If you think about the half, that is DoD as an example, and so -- and that is distributed across all of the services and all of the major components of the Department of Defense. We started in the Navy in 1940, and we're very proud of that association, but these days, Booz Allen serves the entirety of DoD. And in a lot of what we do is to engage our clients not just on today's program but on how some of these capabilities will affect their ability to deliver and accomplish their mission in the future. That is the core of what we have to do to stay ahead for 2 reasons. One, because we need to shape the market to accept those services but also because we need to get reads from the market as to what's going to sell there when. So we are constantly engaged. I was just in the Pacific myself a couple of weeks ago having some of these conversations with clients at senior levels and at mid-levels trying to understand how they see the world, how they see the threats. What are those threats they feel they have a good handle on which of those threats they feel they need more thinking, more help, eventually more capability around. And I'm just one person. This is what we do collectively all the time to try and get a real pulse of what's going on and to the extent that we can to try and shape those conversations so they're productive and so that some of these discussions get some play. I think part of the challenge that many of our government clients have, by virtue of how their market works, is they hear about some of these things but they don't know the true implementability of these technologies in their environment. Blockchain is really interesting. But what can you do with blockchain if you're in the Navy? Really, no kidding. And to what extent would that improve upon the mission, say, around logistics and management of supply chain, which is the traditional place in which you would use blockchain in that context. We have perspectives on that. We have experts that have done it. We have implementations of those things in other parts of the government, which then gives our clients some certainty that these things will create real value. That's really our role. We didn't invent blockchain, and I won't argue that we're the ones that know the most about it in the world; I think that would not be true. But what I will tell you is we have done real no-kidding implementation of blockchain solutions in the federal government. And that gives other federal clients a degree of security that if they really want to try it, they're talking to somebody who knows how to implement these technologies and create value in their environment against their requirements. I'll give you an example that is more accessible. I apologize, it's a little trivial but I think it'll speak to you. I was -- a few years ago, we bought a company, a small company that the core capability that they have was UI UX, user interface, user experience, for the design of government websites. And I sat down with them to try and understand what is it that they did that was so interesting. I mean, it's not like website design is the new technology in 2017, but the requirements that a government entity has, especially around accessibility where people with disabilities in creating a website are unlike anything the private sector faces. And to create actually a seamless meaningful user experience for a government website that meets all of the regulatory requirements that sit around it is that much more difficult than it -- then, say, for Booz Allen's website. And that's the kind of thing that we increasingly work on and try to figure out is. Again, not can you use this technology, can you use it in these particular environments given the unique challenges and requirements that these environments have. And not enough people, frankly, are doing that and that's the source of opportunity for us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And last question. And there have been, like, a number of events, I guess -- like, Har T. Martin, Snowden and Department of Justice investigation. And has that impacted your relationship with the government in any way? And do you feel like if there were another one that could potentially? And I guess, has the noise, I mean, performance and share pricing to be exceeding expectations. So has there been any impact?</p><p>LLOYD W. HOWELL: The one thing that has been consistent, each incident has its own sort of facts and circumstances, but we have historically approached any challenge in a transparent open dialogue with our clients, our investors and our people. And going back to the Snowden and then Martin, and now most recently Justice, we've approached it the same way. We have not seen to-date an adverse impact on our business neither in the form of being able to pursue -- being invited to pursue opportunities, winning, attracting talent, onboarding talent. When we have lost, it's usually been on traditional reasons, pricing, maybe someone has a better technical approach, but the current manner that we're addressing has not been the reason why. And we are working through a dedicated external and internal legal team to address the government and any questions that they may have. But a little over a year ago is when we disclosed that we're aware of investigation. But frankly, this is a process that takes some time, and we don't have any new information to share with you today other than it has not to date impacted our ability to succeed in the market, whether it's with talent or with business.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: Question on capital deployment. And before I do that, I'd be remiss to not also mention that Nick Veasey is here, who is the Head of the Investor Relations, but also used to wear a heat that was more M&amp;A focused, strategy focus as well. He's here, so you can bother him about these questions. But on that topic, there's been consolidation in this market of government services. You all have stood out at least by not being heavily involved in some of the larger deals, which is perfectly fine. But can you sort of give a sense for how you consider -- how you screen for those sorts of opportunities? And perhaps, why you have not been involved thus far in that kind of activity?</p><p>LLOYD W. HOWELL: Sure. M&amp;A remains one of the levers as part of our overall capital deployment strategy. In June, we made a commitment that we were going to deploy $1.4 billion over the 3 years. $400 million of that will be due to our regular recurring dividend, but for the remaining $1 billion, we've got M&amp;A certainly one of the levers that we look at. We look at over 100 opportunities every fiscal year, and we've been very selective for a couple of reasons. One is, our strategy emphasizes capability, development and expansion. So to go out and do $1 billion, let's call it, plus acquisition would fundamentally take us off of our strategy. And we feel we would get distracted trying to integrate and assimilate such a transaction. So capability tuck-ins, reemphasize or emphasize and reinforce our current strategy. And so we have bought an Agile developer, a managed services company, but again on the smaller side and ones that we feel we can integrate. The other thing I'd offer up is today's multiples in pricing are a bit richer than what we feel we can make work given our sort of economic profile and what we aspire to do. So for assets that are out there, we feel they're not meeting with, a, either our quality standards or our economic expectations. And then, again, it comes back to our confidence level on whether we can integrate and it can be a multiplier in the positive way as opposed to a distraction. With the organic performance that we've had, we want to complement that. We don't want it to take away from what we've been able to do over the past couple of years. So that's how M&amp;A fits into our overall thinking and then our capital deployment.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: That's fair. If you're growing 9%, someone might say, \"Oh that's inorganic, right?\" And the answer to that question is, \"No, it's organic.\"</p><p>LLOYD W. HOWELL: Right.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: Fair enough. In the last 3.5 minutes, unless there's something else out there, I wanted to get a sense also on the growth side. Just some more thoughts again going 3 minutes on the option value side? What the excess could be? I know you can't quantify it, but the sorts of things that you're developing internally that could be applied across new opportunities, new customer capabilities.</p><p>HORACIO D. ROZANSKI: Sure. So at the very core, there's a number of things that we do for the government that are unique and that are at the leading edge of what anybody is doing for or with the government, in areas of cybersecurity, directed energy, artificial intelligence being 3 primary examples, and then some of the work we're doing around bringing the government, leapfrogging into full digital relationship with the citizen is the fourth area. And in each one of those, there are certain things that we believe can be monetized in different ways. We've shared at Investor Day, this last Investor Day, our story around AI and the kinds of opportunities that we see in order to creating train models primarily in the areas of intelligence and cyber that we believe would create significant upside. And by significant, I mean anything that would move the P&amp;L 5 to 7 years out by a significant number, tenths of percentages. We've shared in the prior Investor Day an initiative we had at that time, which is now a full-blown opportunity, which was called District, which was a solution to being able to use mobile devices in classified settings, because it operates at the chip level; it's chip level cyber essentially as opposed to software level cyber. We have talked about directed energy and the fact that we had some of the leading contracts in the use of laser, some microwaves, particularly on the weapon side and trying to think about, \"Okay, what can we build, what can we create using that knowledge that fits specific market niches, where our military would significantly benefit from having those capabilities people in the field.\" And so each one of those has a business plan. Each one of those is running as a business opportunity. I don't expect all of them to succeed, but the threshold to get into the pipeline is if we have -- it's a business that would produce several hundred million dollars at maturity, several hundred millions of additional revenue at margins that are often times 2-plus times the margins that we get for our labor-based business today. So in my way of thinking, again, if we have 5 and we get 1 to succeed, that would be a significant driver of future profitability and margin enhancement. If we get more than 1 to succeed, Lloyd and I end up on a cover of some magazines somewhere. But it is a -- it's exciting as an opportunity. It's exciting for investors. It frankly allows us to flex muscles. We haven't flexed in the past. And from a talent retention standpoint, it is crucial because it gives our talent, especially our most sought-after technical talent, the opportunity to work on different kinds of things, to chart more of their own destiny, to feel like they don't have to do the same thing over and over in their careers, which, frankly, will keep them around much longer. So if all we got out of this is that, that would be a tremendously valuable thing, but I believe we will get beyond that, in due time, a significant business upside as well.</p><p>JONATHAN PHAFF RAVIV: Okay. Great. It's as if you've done this before, Horacio. You took us straight down to the 0 second count. So thank you, and thank you very much, Horacio and Lloyd, for being here, and Nick. And also thank you, everyone, for participating here and also on the line, have a great afternoon.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

The target is predictably dull, normal and soporific: the digital monsters of Silicon Valley and their tyrants as demon conjurors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baron Cohen's venue for attack was the Never Is Now Summit hosted by the Anti-Defamation League. In under half-an-hour, the recipient of the ADL's International Leadership Award took YouTube, Facebook and other tech giants to task for not policing that old, troubling matter of disinformation and nasty content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One thing is pretty clear to me: All this hate and violence [in the world] is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history.\" And so does Baron Cohen fall for the trap of presuming that such giants, unlikeable as they might be, are the mediums that confect the message, the propaganda ministers who run the global information program of hate.</p><p>He makes the mistake of assuming that reach and access somehow qualify as production and control. \"Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter and others, they reach billions of people. The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engaged: stories that appeal to our baser instincts, and that trigger outrage and fear.\" Baron Cohen ignores the other base instincts: the cute factor, the cuddly animal, the emetic pet videos that stream through the infoverse and are likewise shared with algorithmic fetish.</p><p>Obviously, Baron Cohen's point here is that the machinists and the designers are flawed for simply giving the searchers of information what they want. They are the diviners of shallowness, grubby, naughty, and insufferable. \"It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times. It's why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth.\" My, oh my.</p><p>Baron Cohen's own stance on disinformation acts as a rich double. \"I've spent most of the past two decades in character. In fact, this is the first time that I have ever stood up and given a speech as my least popular character, Sacha Baron Cohen.\" He prides himself on the art of deception, the false show, the hidden message, but condemns its dissemination by the tech giants and their algorithmic squaddies.</p><p>The British comedian is famed for playing a figure who dissembles and forges false identities, advertising them as authentic to the gullible and moronic. The bumbling, potty-mouthed Ali G, who played a faux ghetto lout from Staines more black than black (the character itself was distinctly milk white often clad in a yellow tracksuit) ensured that those he interviewed were similarly seduced by the show. Only afterwards is the unsuspecting interviewee aware that their interlocutor has deceived them.</p><p>Several notorious cases of this abound in the Baron Cohen cabinet of wonders. The interview with the late Tony Benn, veteran stalwart of British Labour, comes to mind. With Borat, the sharpness becomes positively perpendicular. He moved his way through the United States causing havoc with Borat: Cultural Leanings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. He was sued by Romanian villagers in New York for having misrepresented their village as a Kazakh enclave of retrograde rapists, prostitutes and thieves untouched by history. The Kazakh government expressed concern about the depiction of a country considered \"terra incognita for many in the West\".</p><p>A theme has also been picked up in Baron Cohen's attack, best noted by Casey Newton in The Verge. \"As a rich celebrity who has no need for the free communication tools [social media] provide, and who can thrive without relying on the promotional benefits that come with active use of the platforms, blasting Big Tech costs Baron Cohen nothing.\" And please thank social media for making his speech on the ills of social media viral.</p><p>Nothing here detracts from the necessary contribution Baron Cohen has made to humour and satire. Borat was a vehicle to out anti-Semitism; Bruno the flamboyant flamer of a hairdresser drew out homophobia. (Ironically enough, a former president of the ADL, Abraham Lincoln took issue with Baron Cohen's use of anti-Semitic jokes in 2012. \"You're not going to eradicate it by making fun of it.\")</p><p>Nor is this to say that Cohen does not sport relevantly directed salvos against the information complex that has grown out of Silicon Valley's behemoths. The algorithmic directions do give the marginal and repulsive centre stage. The prospects for radicalisation do exist. But he leaves various things unanswered.

The target is predictably dull, normal and soporific: the digital monsters of Silicon Valley and their tyrants as demon conjurors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baron Cohen's venue for attack was the Never Is Now Summit hosted by the Anti-Defamation League. In under half-an-hour, the recipient of the ADL's International Leadership Award took YouTube, Facebook and other tech giants to task for not policing that old, troubling matter of disinformation and nasty content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One thing is pretty clear to me: All this hate and violence [in the world] is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history.\" And so does Baron Cohen fall for the trap of presuming that such giants, unlikeable as they might be, are the mediums that confect the message, the propaganda ministers who run the global information program of hate. </p><p>He makes the mistake of assuming that reach and access somehow qualify as production and control. \"Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter and others, they reach billions of people. The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engaged: stories that appeal to our baser instincts, and that trigger outrage and fear.\" Baron Cohen ignores the other base instincts: the cute factor, the cuddly animal, the emetic pet videos that stream through the infoverse and are likewise shared with algorithmic fetish.</p><p>Obviously, Baron Cohen's point here is that the machinists and the designers are flawed for simply giving the searchers of information what they want. They are the diviners of shallowness, grubby, naughty, and insufferable. \"It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times. It's why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth.\" My, oh my.</p><p>Baron Cohen's own stance on disinformation acts as a rich double. \"I've spent most of the past two decades in character. In fact, this is the first time that I have ever stood up and given a speech as my least popular character, Sacha Baron Cohen.\" He prides himself on the art of deception, the false show, the hidden message, but condemns its dissemination by the tech giants and their algorithmic squaddies. </p><p>The British comedian is famed for playing a figure who dissembles and forges false identities, advertising them as authentic to the gullible and moronic. The bumbling, potty-mouthed Ali G, who played a faux ghetto lout from Staines more black than black (the character itself was distinctly milk white often clad in a yellow tracksuit) ensured that those he interviewed were similarly seduced by the show. Only afterwards is the unsuspecting interviewee aware that their interlocutor has deceived them. </p><p>Several notorious cases of this abound in the Baron Cohen cabinet of wonders. The interview with the late Tony Benn, veteran stalwart of British Labour, comes to mind. With Borat, the sharpness becomes positively perpendicular. He moved his way through the United States causing havoc with Borat: Cultural Leanings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. He was sued by Romanian villagers in New York for having misrepresented their village as a Kazakh enclave of retrograde rapists, prostitutes and thieves untouched by history. The Kazakh government expressed concern about the depiction of a country considered \"terra incognita for many in the West\".</p><p>A theme has also been picked up in Baron Cohen's attack, best noted by Casey Newton in The Verge. \"As a rich celebrity who has no need for the free communication tools [social media] provide, and who can thrive without relying on the promotional benefits that come with active use of the platforms, blasting Big Tech costs Baron Cohen nothing.\" And please thank social media for making his speech on the ills of social media viral.</p><p>Nothing here detracts from the necessary contribution Baron Cohen has made to humour and satire. Borat was a vehicle to out anti-Semitism; Bruno the flamboyant flamer of a hairdresser drew out homophobia. (Ironically enough, a former president of the ADL, Abraham Lincoln took issue with Baron Cohen's use of anti-Semitic jokes in 2012. \"You're not going to eradicate it by making fun of it.\")</p><p>Nor is this to say that Cohen does not sport relevantly directed salvos against the information complex that has grown out of Silicon Valley's behemoths. The algorithmic directions do give the marginal and repulsive centre stage. The prospects for radicalisation do exist. But he leaves various things unanswered. There is no consideration about the implications of censorship or control of content left in the hands of such giants. Silicon Valley companies are also being co-opted as mutual regulators, with content commissars keen to ensure that matters offensive or reprehensible are not disseminated. </p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has picked up on this thread of reasoning. In April in the Washington Post, he opened the door for greater government regulation of social media entities. \"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.\" He made all the right signals for state officials, suggesting that governments pass laws on, \"Harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\" </p><p>But as is shown by the passage of such legislative instruments as the FOSTA-SESTA law, intended to target online sex trafficking, the object is often avoided. Instead of reducing sex trafficking, the law seems to have had the effect of emboldening pimps and increasing their market share. Websites rushed to self-censor; Reddit kicked several communities associated with sex work off its platforms while Craigslist removed personals altogether.</p><p>Even more troubling is Baron Cohen's suggestion to amend section 230 of the Communications Decency Act making social media companies liable for what their users generate or post. As the current reading goes, \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p>This is simply too much for the comedian. If internet companies can be held responsible for enabling paedophiles to use sites to ensnare children then \"let's hold these companies responsible for those who use their sites to advocate mass murder of children because of their race or religion.\"</p><p>Nothing would be more fitting than a genuine chastising and limitation on the power of these digital daemons.

Thank you so much and good morning, everyone. Happy Monday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 1st, April Fools' Day. Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Easing concerns about a slowdown in China, a pair of manufacturing reports shows a rebound in activity in China. We've got all the news driving global markets this morning and we do see a global rally. The battle over the -- securing the border is on. President Trump threatening to shut down the entire border with Mexico as funding is cut to three Central American countries. And then what's old is new again, T-Mobile unveils a phone booth, taking a jab at AT&amp;T, but the joke may be on you. The story coming up. Plus, Toyota gets in on March madness. The robot cannot dunk or dribble, but it can sink a three-pointer. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>All right. Futures are pointing to a big rally this morning, take a look at stocks, up 176 points on the Dow Industrials, as the second quarter kicks off today. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ up at least 11 percent in the first quarter. Big quarter for markets, as you see this morning, we kick off a new quarter with a triple-digit gain, up 177 points on the Dow Industrials, up 18 points on the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ right now up 69 points. Investors are watching some key economic data. We did get the upbeat news out of China yesterday. We were talking about this on Friday. We've got the China PMI above expectations. That was the manufacturing sector news. It was, of course, a busy week last week, and it's going to be a busy week this week, with the March Jobs Report this Friday.</p><p>Let's turn to border security meanwhile, President Trump threatens to close the border with Mexico if it does not do more to stop illegal immigrants from reaching the United States and cutting aid to three Central American countries. I spoke to South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday about the crisis situation at the border now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president declared he is likely to shut down the border, the Southern Border, unless Mexican authorities immediately halt all illegal immigration. We've got two caravan coming -- two caravans coming to the country right now. Your reaction to the President's threat.</p><p>GRAHAM: We've had a hundred thousand people cross the border illegally in March alone. We're on track to over a million this year if it keeps up. So, Mexico could help more, they should help more. The triangle countries, 70 percent of the people coming here illegally come from three countries.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GRAHAM: We need those countries to help more. So if the President feels like that the only way to control this problem is to move the people from the port of entry to the ungoverned spaces where we need a wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>GRAHAM: -- I will support him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Washington Examiner, Commentary Writer, Tiana Lowe. Tiana, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us. What kind of an impact would that have, shoving -- shutting the border? And we should point out other presidents have shut the border entirely.</p><p>TIANA LOWE, COMMENTARY WRITER, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: So the big issue with our border is less, you know, the physicality of it and more are asylum laws, so the issue is that, you know, anyone who winds up on American soil, which is before where any physical barrier is, can simply claim asylum and as long as they go to one court date, they're usually released. So, I think -- I mean the constitutionality of shutting down the border will come into question, but this is a President empowered, empowered by the Mueller report, empowered by the fact that Congress failed to override his national emergency declaration, so he will do what he wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point. You know, having said that, the reports show that over a hundred thousand immigrants are expected to have crossed in March alone. So, we're talking about a hundred thousand in March, you just heard Lindsey Graham say a million in the entire year. What's your reaction to actually the activity right now at the border?</p><p>LOWE: So we're obviously seeing heightened traffic because word gets around, word gets around that our border security is sort of overflowing, there's too much work for -- to be done with the amount of resources that we have on staff, and more than anything, it's these asylum laws. Every reporter that I've spoken to goes down to the border, they all say the same things, the problem are the asylum laws less than the physical barriers. If the laws themselves are broken, then there's not much that any physical fortication or fortification can do to stop it. So, it is just a word of mouth situation. If people know that there is a good chance that they won't get caught, there will be increased activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean is there anything else the President can do at this point?</p><p>LOWE: I mean, this is why messaging is so important and the problem with Trump is that he takes -- I mean the President takes issues that should be broadly popular and terms them into 50/50 issues. You know, enforcing existing immigration law should not be controversial. Democrats have been taking this hardline position. If Trump makes the message not about Muslim bans, not about vastly changing our existing immigration laws, but about enforcing what's already there, that's the messaging more that he should not have a large ability to lose, because I think that most people agree, in order for us to be a sovereign nation, we must have borders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean most people agree, but they agree differently on how to solve it, right?</p><p>LOWE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean the President now is fighting a battle in the Congress even --</p><p>LOWE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- to get the -- to get the appropriate money to actually finish building the wall.</p><p>LOWE: Yes. And the difficulty is that every single time he's -- he is apparently sidestepping Congress in the national emergency declaration, trying to re-divert funding, it makes it seem as though he's the aggressor rather than just the person who's trying to enforce existing American law, and that's why messaging here is so important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LOWE: The American public has to be on his side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Tiana. Thanks for very much for weighing in here. Tiana Lowe joining us there. Meanwhile, a well-known rapper shot dead in broad daylight in Los Angeles. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines there, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, good morning. Well, Grammy-nominated Nipsey Hussle was one of three people shot outside a clothing store that he reportedly owned. The shooter still on the run, two others were rushed to the hospital. Celebrities like Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, and LeBron James all posting tributes to the musician online. The rapper claimed to be a gang member on his Facebook page. We should add the father of two was just 33 years old.</p><p>Well, Britain's Parliament set to hold more votes today on alternatives for leaving the European Union. That's as Prime Minister Theresa May plans to bring her proposal back before lawmakers for a fourth vote. Parliament has rejected May's plans three times. Today's vote could include a softer deal that could set up a customs union with the E.U. Meanwhile, easyJet is saying the uncertainty over Britain's divorce from the E.U. is pushing ticker prices lower. The discount carrier saying that demand for flights is actually weakening.</p><p>And let's talk about what's happening here at home, Dumbo falling short at the box office, but still soaring above the competition. The Disney remake earning an estimated $45 million domestically at the Weekend Box Office. That was below analysts' expectations of around 50 million, but, again, still making some money and, hey, it's Dumbo, Maria. Who doesn't love a little Dumbo?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, who doesn't love it? Exactly. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, 2020 vision accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden now. It happened after a former Democratic legislator made the charges. . His response to that coming up. Then T-Mobile going nostalgic, the phone company unveils a phone booth, but there is a catch, we will tell you all about it when we come right back right here. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We got a big program this morning. Coming up right here, California Congressman and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is with us this morning, Pennsylvania Congressman and House Budget Committee Member, Dan Meuser is with us this morning, along with FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Radio Host, AM 970, and former SNL alum, Joe Piscopo here as well, don't miss a moment of it. We got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>We want to kick it off right here with this news on Joe Biden, the Former Vice President and possible 2020 contender, is defending his behavior this morning after being accused of inappropriately touching Former NevadaCongress -- Assembly Woman Lucy Flores back in 2014. Now Flores is speaking out for the first time on this, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUCY FLORES, FORMER NEVADA ASSEMBLYWOMAN: Very unexpectedly and out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair, and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head. It was shocking because you don't expect that kind of intimate behavior. You don't expect that kind of intimately from someone so powerful and someone who you just have no relationship whatsoever to touch you and to feel you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Biden released a statement yesterday in response and he said this in part, \"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort, and not once, never, did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did, I will listen respectively. But it was never my intention.\"</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is FOX Business Network's Susan Li along with Former Presidential Candidate, FormerArkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee, and FOX News Contributor, Columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek. It is great to have everybody here this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Thank you.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This news coming in a very inopportune time for Joe Biden just before he wants to announce that he's going to run for president, Liz.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. The problem is we've seen so many instances like this over the years, and he's gotten a pass. Time and time again, when he leans in, he hugs people, he kisses them, you know, look, we don't know really know whether anything ever came of any this, whether people were really uncomfortable. This woman is, you know, she was a Bernie Sanders supporter, so there's some back and forth about was this the Bernie Sanders campaign, was it Beto O'Rourke, she went to his rally over the weekend, who knows? Maybe it was politically motivated, but the answer is it was creepy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Bottom line, it was creepy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's what it sounds like, Governor.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it is creepy, but I have to say I don't think Joe Biden is a sexual predator.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I think he's a creepy old guy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- who is a little hands on --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- and all that, but I mean, most of the things he's done, he's done in a very public place.</p><p>PEEK: True.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It wasn't like he invited women up --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- to a hotel room or an office by himself. This is stuff he's done with a thousand cameras on him and he did it anyway. So, I just think this is Joe, and I kind of like the guy, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I mean I do. But this -- the timing of the person coming forward, a little suspicious just before he announces.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Why she --</p><p>HUCKABEE: If it was that uncomfortable --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why she -- exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- why didn't she say this a year ago or the day after it happened? The fact that she does it on the cusp of his announcement, a little suspect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think she's for Bernie Sanders? Is that what this is about, a Bernie Sanders opponent?</p><p>HUCKABEE: It sounds like it could be, or maybe she's for Beto, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, no.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- but she's not for Joe, I think that's pretty clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's really clear.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But one thing we know, she ain't a Biden supporter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Why wait until now? It happened in 2014.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>LI: She waited five years to discuss this when, you know, Joe Biden does have a history of changing his mind, whether or not he runs for president.</p><p>PEEK: Well, she says it's because all of a sudden he could be president. And she sort of felt like this is the moment to actually say something, that's her, you know, that's the --</p><p>LI: Well, why not 2016 then?</p><p>PEEK: -- as she answers why.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that's why, because he's running for president.</p><p>LI: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's making no secret out of it.</p><p>LI: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the path continues to get wider on the Democrat's side, but every time we hear policy, if we are hearing any policy from any of this of the -- of the contenders, it's socialist policies, it's pretty incredible what this -- what the lineup is looking like going into 2020, don't you think?</p><p>HUCKABEE: They continue to go further and further to the left, and each candidate wants to outleft the other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And I think what they're going to do, they're going to outleft their own party because there are a lot of democrats in the country who are who are sane, moderate Democrats who are not as far out there on the socialistic issues both economically, as well as socially. They're not for afterbirth abortion, they're not for late-term abortion, they're not for higher taxes, and they're not for open borders, and they're finding themselves increasingly left out from this Democratic Party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: It's not just their party, it's the country. I don't the country's on board with these --</p><p>HUCKABEE: No.</p><p>PEEK: Policies. As you -- I mean you just rattled them off, but these are really extreme positions they've taken, open borders, I don't know anyone who supports that even on the left, so -- except the people running for 00 running for president. What are they thinking?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not to mention -- not to mention abortion in the ninth month of the pregnancy.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. Oh, my gosh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's actually absurd.</p><p>PEEK: It's horrifying.</p><p>LI: Well, AOC was defending her Green New Deal on Friday night, and he -- she was basically saying that this is a new generational stuff, you know. It's very meta. IT takes a young mind to understand it, but when, you know, as a younger person, you're looking at $40 trillion, I just do the math, and I think how are we going to pay for this? I know everybody wants free education, better education, they want better health care, at the end of it, I don't know if they understand that the bill does need to be paid by somebody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LI: And eventually be them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually, Douglas Holtz-Eakin's group says that the Green New Deal is going to cost $94 trillion for the Green New Deal. And look what happened last week, they all got a shot to actually put their money where their mouth was.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what did they do? They either voted no or they voted present for the Green New Deal.</p><p>PEEK: They voted present. They ran for the hills.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I mean deep down, everybody knows you're not going to get rid of airplanes and cars in 10 years. You're just not.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Nobody can swim that far to Hawaii or Europe. It's -- we're not there yet. And the other thing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're not there yet.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- when we talk socialism, people need to ask Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, name one country on planet Earth where socialism is working right now. Tell us just one place where it's really --</p><p>PEEK: Not 300 million people.</p><p>HUCKABEE: There's -- but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Bill Maher tried to make this argument the other night on his show, and he said that the Nordic countries, Denmark, Norway --</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's not -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, that's what he was saying.</p><p>PEEK: But actually those countries --</p><p>LI: But taxes are 60 percent in Sweden and Norway.</p><p>PEEK: Those countries are rolling back with their high taxes and their -- because they've all experienced big influx of immigrants, and all of a sudden, the model that seemed to work very well does no longer work. So, in Fact, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, they've all started rolling back their big safety net, et cetera, it isn't working anymore. So in fact there is no country anymore that really sort of epitomizes what these people want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They've tried to have market principles there though as well as --</p><p>PEEK: More or less.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, more or less.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well -- and like Norway, they had enormous energy --</p><p>PEEK: Yes, yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- resources there that was paying for a lot of this stuff.</p><p>PEEK: That's right. It's funded.</p><p>HUCKABEE: So it wasn't like it was a pure socialism. Everybody just tossing everything to the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Divvy it back out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's right.</p><p>PEEK: And by the way, in terms of the generation thing, AOC'S approval ratings now way under water. So, it isn't like this is really resonating with a big sector of the population, I don't think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good point. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we got the China manufacturing data, it hit a six-month high. And then this, selling cigarettes a Walgreens could be a thing of the past as they're attempting to get into these CBD game to rival CVS. More on that coming up. Then winter is coming to Las Vegas, the famous Bellagio Hotel, the fountain there gets a Game of Thrones makeover with just two weeks until the series finale. We'll show you all of it coming up after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning, The New York Times is reporting that New York State Budget Deal is bringing congestion pricing plastic bag ban and a mansion tax. New York State lawmakers are approving legislation to ban plastic bags from retail stores. New York will become the second state to do so after California banned plastic bags back in 2016. Meanwhile, the state assembly is also voting in favor of a tax on multimillion dollar homes. Congestion pricing for drivers entering Midtown Manhattan, the changes are set to be enacted in 2020. A lot going on in New York.</p><p>The South Florida Sun Sentinel says that \"Falling meteor lights up sky over Florida.\" Residents of Northern Florida experienced quite the sight Saturday night as a meteor was seen shooting across the night sky. Dash cam footage captured the rare sighting. And the National Weather Service confirmed that it was a meteor and even caught it on their forecasting map used in -- to track lighting strikes.</p><p>The Las Vegas Review-Journal reporting that Game of Thrones water show comes live on the Las Vegas strip. Pretty cool. The Bellagio fountains unveiling a new Game of Thrones inspired fountain show, complete with music and projections from the series. The show will be performed nightly at the resort until April 13th and the final season of HBO's Game of Thrones premiers on April 14th. We got a lot to talk about here.</p><p>I guess first let's tackle the New York taxes and the millionaire's tax, right ahead of, you know, Tax Day, April 15th, where New York, among other states, lost the salt. I think we could see a little sticker shock after the tax -- after Tax Day in April 15th, but this millionaire's tax --</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is this going to continue driving people out of New York, Susan?</p><p>LI: Well, I think so. I mean we've seen an exodus of multimillionaires going to Florida, and other parts across the country where you have basically zero income taxes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>LI: Also congestion pricing. What about average consumers that pays for rides? You know, that's going to go up per ride for, you know, the average person here in New York City as well, so, you know, they're trying to make the half billion dollar tax short fall, this is going to hurt the consumer top and bottom.</p><p>PEEK: Not to mention the price or the cost for a truck coming in and out of the city to bring in food, $133 one day. So, that's daily cost. I mean, it is going to drive up price of food and all kinds of things that are brought into the city fresh every day. I think it's unbelievable. Honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is. And Cuomo, the governor, has already said, he's facing a $2 billion hole on his budget. Governor, people are just going to continue moving out.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: They are. I mean they might as well get a fire hose and just chase people across the bridges because that's what they're doing --</p><p>LI: That's next.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- with their tax policies. It's amazing to me. Like this nutty thing about the plastic bag, a nickel. OK. Here's what people are missing, maybe plastic is not the best thing, but they say use recyclables. Problem with that, use a cloth bag, you go and you put meat and different produce in it, now you contaminate it, more people are getting sick because they're using these --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- sorts of bags rather than the disposable ones.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: So let's have disease. That works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we've said this --</p><p>LI: So early.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- a number of times, the plastic in the ocean is not from plastic bags.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's largely nets, it's largely fishing nets.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's not straws either.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes. And it's not from the U.S. largely.</p><p>PEEK: Oh, it's such tokenism. It's tokenism. You know, it's like we have to do something, but also this is a revenue grab. I mean, look, every blue state in the country is putting on these faux taxes, faux environmentally friendly taxes, whether it's straws or bags and stuff, and who does it hurt? It hurts people who can't afford it. I mean that is really the maddening thing about all of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They refuse to lower state taxes.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And one quick thought, if you're going to move to New York and come to Florida, would you please leave your crazy New York politics in New York or don't come?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Just don't bring that nutty stuff with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's good point because look at Texas.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's sort of turning purple now.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It is turning purple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People from high-tax states go to Texas, and then force new laws.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes. Makes no sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break.</p><p>PEEK: It is pretty crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When we come back, T-Mobile, what is old is new again. It is rolling out a new phone booth that pokes fun at AT&amp;T, but we'll tell you the catch coming up. Then Toyota's March madness, robot, it can dunk, no, it cannot dunk or dribble, but it can sink a three-pointer. More in sports coming up, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, April 1st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>A global market rally is underway due to strong manufacturing data out of China, we told you the look for the PMI Index on Friday, and in fact, the Purchasing Managers' Index came in at a six-month high, showing that manufacturing is strengthening in China. That is lifting both across the world.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up, this morning, 170 points, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also higher and the Dow closed up eight-tenths of a percent on Friday, wrapping up the first quarter. It was the best first quarter in a decade.</p><p>Check out these moves, the Dow up 11 percent for the quarter, the S&amp;P 500 up 13 percent for the first quarter, and the NASDAQ up 17 percent for the first quarter, we kick off a new quarter this morning, and we're going to get earnings for the first quarter in the next two weeks.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a firmer tone there, as well, take a look, FT 100 up 44 points, two-thirds of one percent, CAC Quarante in Paris up 27 and the DAX Index in Germany up 125 points.</p><p>Stocks surged overnight, in Asia, as well, the Chinese Shanghai Composite, the big winner, up 2-1/2 percent on the session, on the heels of that manufacturing gauge, hitting a six-month high.</p><p>Well, tobacco-free test, not ready to quit the cigarette game just yet, Walgreens trying out tobacco products-free stores in the United States, plus no case of Mondays here, the list of best places to work is out, we will tell you where you can find the happiest employees, this morning.</p><p>And back to the future, T-Mobile installs phone booths for privacy, but the joke is on you. And then, this, got game, Toyota unveils a robot with a strong three-pointer from March Madness action.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Monday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the Mueller report, Attorney General William Barr expected to release a redacted version to the public by the middle of this month.</p><p>In a new Wall Street Journal poll shows that the results of the investigation are easing Americans' doubts about President Trump, 57 percent said that the probe has not given them more doubts about the presidency.</p><p>For more than a year and a half, I've been asking the tough questions to those on both sides of the aisle about the circumstances that actually led up to the investigation and the doubts cast in the collusion narrative, let's take a look back at how it all unfolded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have been hearing bits and pieces of the so-called Russia probe, so called collusion between Trump and the Russians with absolutely zero evidence, is that the insurance policy, was Peter Strzok basically saying to his mistress, look, we're just going to keep investigating Donald Trump, should he win?</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIR, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Boy, surely reads that way, but the only way we're going to know that, is to interview Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What bothers people out there is you have to be able to trust your FBI, your CIA, your IRS, because there is a thing called the rule of law, and what we've learned from some of these text messages is that there's a whole lot of bias and corruption going on at the top. Tell us what you have learned.</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIR, HOUSE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE: Yes, and it's important to emphasize there are tens of thousands of great men and women who, every day, keep us safe, prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes, at the FBI.</p><p>But they are being besmirched by several people in the leadership of the FBI that have a shocking contrast in the way they took -- the approach they took to the Clinton investigation and the one they've taken to the Trump investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You joined us four weeks ago on this program, at that time, you said you wanted to get the electronic communication from the Department of Justice and the FBI, you wanted that electronic communications to understand exactly how the Trump investigation into collusion even began. You have now since seen the electronic communication, yes?</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: That's correct. So, it took us a long time to actually get this what's called the electronic communication, as we know now for your viewers, what that is, is that's the original intelligence, the original reasons that the counterintelligence investigation was started.</p><p>Now, this is really important to us because the counterintelligence investigation uses the tools of our intelligence services that are not supposed to be used on American citizens, so we've long wanted to know, well, what intelligence did you have, that actually led to this investigation?</p><p>So, what we've found now, after the investigators have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>GRAHAM: If you ask the FBI today, how much of the dossier is verified, almost none, and the verification comes from open-media sources, this dossier was prepared by foreign agent, paid by the Democratic Party and used to get a FISA warrant.</p><p>And the FBI, former FBI director did not know that it was a political document paid by a political party. To me, that is stunning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GRAHAM: Not only was the Clinton e-mail investigation, a joke, the dossier was used inappropriately.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you call yourself someone who, you know, agrees with and follows the rule of law if, in fact, you used a piece of garbage as, you know, the reason to wiretap and listen in on an American citizen.</p><p>Any comments on Peter Strzok and these testimonies that we are seeing, Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray, why don't you just direct your subordinates to get those documents over to Congress, are you going to do it?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, I have this country running like a top, Mike Pompeo is doing great, we really have a great group of people. The one thing I want to say I'm involved in -- at least, for now, I may get involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>TRUMP: But I've been told by so many people, don't get involved. You know, all these people got involved and it's not good. And they'll get the documents. And it's getting, and they're getting them and they are great people. I didn't like the scene, the other day, where everybody is screaming at each other. You know, I don't like that because it's bad for the country.</p><p>You know, if Russia is, in fact, looking to sow discord, or chaos, they're going to be saying this is the greatest thing we've ever done, OK? Now, there's no collusion with me, there's no Russia with me --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>TRUMP: -- there's no nothing. It's -- honestly, it's a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see all of the evidence, I got it, and I understand, I think, what took place in 2016 and yet, it hasn't resonated with the broad public as much. It's incredible that they've thrown out their ideals, their values, of all of the things we hold dear, our freedoms, wiretapping someone for no reason, because it's Donald Trump.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, you know, number one, I'm really discouraged as a former Justice Department official who gave 17 years of his life to the Justice Department, to see a Justice Department under sessions that will do nothing about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They had informants trying to lure Trump campaign officials to get them into meetings. They had immediately strategy, apparently, all the while knowing that there was no collusion. I mean, this is just extraordinary, Congressman.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-T), MEMBER, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: More than 70 witnesses appeared before the House Intelligence Committee, all of them were asked the same question, what evidence do you have of Russian collusion with Donald Trump or the Trump campaign, what evidence do you have of conspiracy, what evidence do you have of coordination?</p><p>And they batted a thousand in their response. These are folks likes Susan Rice and Samantha Powers, Senior DOJ and department officials and intelligence and law enforcement officials, and they all said we don't have any.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've covered this a lot for the last year and a half, and we know that there was real FISA abuse, where the FBI did not tell the FISA judge who paid for the dossier that it was a political document, et cetera, are you going to pursue that, are you going to seek the truth there?</p><p>REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Maria, that's not accurate. And I've looked at every single one --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's not accurate, sir?</p><p>HIMES: -- of the FISA affidavits -- that the Justice Department, in any way, misled the judge. I understand that that's a Republican talking point, but that's certainly not accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, no, no, I didn't say --</p><p>HIMES: The FBI --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I didn't say misled, they did not tell the judge that the Democrats paid for the dossier, that's a fact.</p><p>How are you going to get anything done with all of this?</p><p>TRUMP: This should never happen to another president. What happened to me -- they came up with an excuse for losing an election, this should never happen to another president, because most presidents wouldn't be able to take it. I know the politicians, I know the president, I know -- I know what we are dealing with. Most people wouldn't be able to take it.</p><p>Let me tell you something, Maria, what happened to me should never happen to another president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you have to ask yourself now, where does this go from here, and how high up the chain did it go, Liz? I mean, we know from the Lisa Page testimony that the DOJ told the FBI, lay off of Hillary Clinton, we're not going to bring charges.</p><p>PEEK: Well, also, we know that the Obama administration instigated all of these, I mean, we've heard that from Brennan, from Clapper, I mean, it was clear that this was from the highest levels. I think this is such an outrage. It has divided our country, undermined this administration, and really hurt the country.</p><p>Think about the fact that the Chinese have now said that they weren't really ready to negotiate a trade deal until they found about the Mueller report, because they weren't sure they were dealing with the President who'd be in office four years from now. That is so offensive to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: That this country's welfare has been basically undermined by this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really was.</p><p>PEEK: -- investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And for a year, the media has driven the bus on this.</p><p>PEEK: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, the media is out, you know, perpetrating and continuing this story. That's why I'm so proud of my coverage and our coverage on this program, and on FOX News on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" because I was on the right side of justice and I got -- I took hits, a lot of hits, online, for it.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But it was important that you kept pointing out that if you don't have evidence --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- and all you have is evidence of government agencies using their power as a political weapon. That is frightening for every American. I don't care if you're liberal or conservative Democrat or Republican. You ought to be outraged that the very highest levels of government including Clapper and Brennan, and Strzok and Page, and McCabe, and Comey, were all basically acting like dirty cops.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And Brennan, he's running around with his CIA title, Former Director of the CIA, when he says something because of that title, you stop and listen.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And (INAUDIBLE) saying treasonous.</p><p>PEEK: He knows something that the world doesn't know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, exactly, exactly.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've got big news this morning. Markets are rallying because of this China story. The manufacturing gauge at a six-month high, we're going to look at markets in a moment. But first, two marine pilots -- there's the Dow Industrials up 177 points this morning.</p><p>Two marine pilots, meanwhile, were killed in a helicopter crash, Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, there, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria, and good morning, again. So, this happened on a routine training mission near Yuma, Arizona on Saturday night, the cause of the crash, under investigation. The marines are notifying families before they release the names of those pilots.</p><p>Another headline this morning for you, Walgreens isn't ready to quit cigarette sales just yet. Wall Street Journal is reporting that the drugstore chain is testing tobacco-free stores in the U.S., but they don't plan to quit selling cigarettes entirely. Walgreens says it's trying to help smokers quit by making products that help people quit widely available.</p><p>The pharmacy chain has also reduced the visibility of tobacco products in some of its stores. There is a one-year chart of Walgreens Boots Alliance.</p><p>Well, T-Mobile, not waiting to get their April Fools on, the telecom giant has announced brand-new phone booths in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Seattle, with the promise of many more of these to come. The idea, it's too noisy in the city. You might need a place to just stand, talk, and even recharge your device.</p><p>Of course, all revealed, fake April Fool's joke, so we'll see how many more of these stories I get this morning before the end of the show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh God, I've got to be on my -- on my game today with all of the April Fool's jokes.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, the happiest workplace on Earth, Costco, among the top places where employees are smiling, other companies that made the best place to work list, coming up. And then, robot on the court now, Toyota's new player, can shoot three-pointers and hardly misses a free throw, as well, more on sports, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, here's the list: Costco, Google, Apple, T- Mobile, all among the best places to work according to a new study. Lauren Simonetti with details here. Lauren, what goes into this list?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: A lot of different things. So, if you have a case of Mondays today, as a lot of people do, maybe you want to consider working at these companies. What goes into the list, and it's from Comparably.com, that's a workplace culture site, is where employees found they had a future, a bright future, and if they would recommend this company to a friend. So, let's show you the top five first. Number five is Globant, it's an artificial intelligence type company. Insight Global, number four, automation.</p><p>Workfront, software, at number three. U.I. Path, automation at number two. We've got to talk about number one. The best company on the list is Hubspot. Listen to why: unlimited vacation, autonomy -- you can pick when you work, if you work as long as you get the work done, it's totally fine. And you can obviously create your own schedule. So, I just think millennials, when I think of that company. So, that is the best place to work for; it's based out of Massachusetts. Some of the more familiar names. I know a lot of people haven't heard of those names -- they're smaller companies.</p><p>For the more familiar names: Costco came in at number seven; T-Mobile, nine; Google, 10; Microsoft and Disney. Quick comment on Costco. I was looking at some of the reasons and the positive reviews on this company. So, obviously their minimum wage is $15.00 an hour, but some of the negatives were that you know what, the hourly employees are capped at eight hours and the managers who aren't paid that much more but obviously more than $15.00 an hour, they work very long days. So, that was the complaint. And then finally, the big-tech companies that we always talk about, this is where they ranked: 32 is Amazon, Facebook, 43; followed by Apple, followed by Starbucks. Facebook's negative too work-alcoholic of a culture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I think it's interesting that the top five are all these small tech companies dealing with robotics or A.I. But did you say that the number one says that you can have unlimited vacation, at Hubspot?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. I'd love to work there also.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! That's a good perk!</p><p>SIMONETTI: Could you get anything fun if you have that many perks for your employees? If you could make your own schedule, do you really think that you would get a lot of work done?</p><p>PEEK: OK. First of all, I'm skeptical that all these little, tiny A.I. firms didn't fix this deal, right? That understand the algorithms, and didn't make sure that they were at the top of the list. Number two, in terms of unlimited vacation, you know, probably nobody takes it. That's -- I mean, the bottom line is, if you're caught up in a company that you're excited about and you're doing great stuff and inventing new things, you're not going to take a whole lot of vacation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How ironic.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I always thought unlimited vacation was called unemployment.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Amazing.</p><p>LI: But, (INAUDIBLE) is hard. So, you know, giving them the freedom that's kind of what you want, and you want to work wherever you can, it's all about productivity at the end. If I hand in what you need, how many hours does it take me? Does it matter? Does it matter where --</p><p>SIMONETTI: And that's their point, exactly.</p><p>PEEK: I wonder how much money comes into it versus freedom. It does seem like flexibility and freedom is a really very big deal these days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think so. Great list. Thank you, Lauren. Coming up, the final four, March Madness enters the final countdown, as players could one day face competition from Toyota's basketball robot. All the highlights coming up next in sports. And then, check this out: a harness by Reynolds that can hold your game day snacks. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are down to final four. It is set. Jared Max, what an exciting weekend of basketball. Good morning, Jared.</p><p>MAX: March Madness lived up to its name. Good morning, Maria. We had overtimes. We had upsets and we have few brackets that did not select Duke to make it to the final four. Yesterday, Duke led Michigan State by one of the final-minute. Kenny Goins nails a three-point shot; Duke then down two with under 10 second to play, and R.J. Barrett needed to make two free throws but he missed the first one, and that was it. Michigan State wins it by a point, 68 to 67, as the Spartans go to their eight final four under head coach, Tom Izzo and Zion Williamson's college career likely over.</p><p>How about the Auburn Tigers Star, Chuma Okeke, tours (INAUDIBLE) on Friday's win but he got to the arena for the second-half against (INAUDIBLE) Kentucky which made only five of 21 attempts from three-point range -- not enough. Auburn, which battled back from ten down scored 17 to the final 15 of regulation, and then 15 points in overtime. And then win led by Jared Harper and Bryce Brown and combined the score 50 -- 12 points for Harper in overtime. Auburn, check this out, the students rushed to (INAUDIBLE) at Auburn. This is when students go where they celebrate the Auburn victories, and toilet paper streaming -- that's part of the tradition. It began back, in what, 1972. Two schools in the final four for the first time. First game Saturday night in Minneapolis. Auburn, the five-seat underdog to 5-1/2 against number one seat Virginia. And then, Texas Tech, playing in its first final four. Underdogs of three versus Michigan State.</p><p>The way some players of three-point shot that seems robotic, but check out this robot shooting threes. This is -- his name is Q3. It's a robot made by Toyota's motor corporation. And today, near Tokyo Q3 showed up its ability to shoot three-point shots. It has sensors in its torso, makes adjustment in its arms, motors, and the knees calculate the proper angle to shoot and how much (INAUDIBLE) to put into the shot. It made three out of five shots. So, not too bad. Or five out of eight, I should say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, that's amazing to see the robots now taking to the court, Jared.</p><p>MAX: Yes, and we saw robotic-like shooting this weekend in college basketball, even three as well is pretty cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. Just in time for baseball, Reynolds is out with a backpack for your snacks, hot and cold. Cheryl Casone with the details now, modeling it for us. Wow! Cheryl!</p><p>CASONE: What I do for you, Maria. This is the hunger harness from Reynolds Wrap. And for $4.99, you can have all of your snacks in a little portable trade, you can take to the baseball park with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at the tray! Oh my god!</p><p>CASONE: Yes, here's your little tray. You can drink your \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA soda, by the way. Look at that. Because here's that one soda with Maria on it, there you go. And then, we have like chicken wings, and a fried mozzarella sticks, a little salsa to go with everything. This is the -- if you want to get out of the coach and you want to not to -- and not move from the coach, and just eat while you're watching the game, this is for you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I've heard of harness is to hold your baby, but a harness to hold for your game day snacks?</p><p>HUCKABEE: And don't you want to be the guy sitting right in front of someone eating with one of those, and then your food from this guy swab behind you is falling is falling all down your neck. This is going to be a real joy.</p><p>CASONE: All I know is that it's got mozzarella sticks.
