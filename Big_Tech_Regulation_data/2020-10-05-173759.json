It relates to a case in which sensitive personal data about an individual against whom an allegation of abuse had been made was posted on social media.</p><p>It is the second time in a matter of weeks Tusla has been on the receiving end of enforcement action by the DPC. Earlier this month, an application was made to the courts in relation to an investigation which involved three different breaches. One of these saw the contact and location data of a mother and child victim disclosed to an alleged abuser. </p><h>Foster care Another related to the improper disclosure of data about children in foster care to blood relatives, including in one instance to an imprisoned father. </h><p>The Twitter decision relates to the company's handling of a data breach in November 2018 which it reported to the DPC. Specifically, the DPC examined the social media giant's compliance with two aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a strict set of European laws introduced in 2018. </p><p>The specific sections in question govern the promptness of the disclosure of the data breach, as well as how the company handled aspects of the breach, including record-keeping and documentation which would enable regulators verify compliance with the GDPR. </p><p>In addition to the Twitter finding and the fine for Tusla, the DPC said yesterday it has passed other milestones in relation to two inquiries into Facebook, and other platforms owned by the social media company. </p><h>WhatsAppIreland</h><p>A preliminary draft decision has been sent to WhatsApp Ireland, the messenger platform owned by Facebook. Graham Doyle, deputy commissioner with the DPC, said the inquiry into WhatsApp is examining its compliance with the GDPR's articles 12 to 14 \"in relation to transparency around what information is shared with Facebook\". </p><p>The watchdog also said it has completed the investigation phase of an inquiry into Facebook Ireland's obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing. This inquiry is based on a complaint made by the Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems. </p><p>Draft inquiry reports have also been sent to the complainants and companies involved in two other \"big tech\" inquiries, which concern WhatsApp and Instagram, the photo-sharing platform also owned by Facebook, the DPC said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4260879</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYR-CFD1-JC8Y-80P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 23, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In theory this should give you the option to stop companies keeping tabs on what you look at online. In practice, however, most people click to \"accept\" cookies, because if they don't, access to the site may be blocked.</p><p>Some are calling this practice \"forced consent\". It is not the choice the GDPR was supposed to create. Privacy advocates say a true choice would mean being able to use services without having to give up your data, perhaps by paying for them. A Vienna-based organisation called NOYB (None of Your Business) has filed complaints against Google in France, Facebook in Austria and Facebookowned WhatsApp (in Germany) and Instagram (in Belgium) for using these quick permission slips.</p><p>To complicate matters, what constitutes \"consent\" in the digital world isn't clear. Companies risk big fines if their tactics are found to be non-compliant. But do they care? Tech giants have especially deep pockets.</p><p>\"People still say a large fine, even $5bn, is not going to bring down a big company like Google,\" says Anu Bradford, a director of the European Legal Studies Centre at New York's Columbia University.\"So the question is whether even the EU, with its high-profile investigations, is going to be able to regulate quite as eectively as it would want to.\"</p><p>The problem is there aren't many other options for people who want to avoid the likes of Facebook and Google. The GDPR is expensive to comply with, so start-ups - even privacy-minded ones -may have a hard time abiding by the law. That could mean fewer challengers to big tech and ultimately fewer options for consumers. While the GDPR was meant to level the playing field, it may unintentionally have tilted the pitch in the wrong direction \u00a6 Ruth Reader is a freelance technology writer based in New York</p><p>DON'T PANIC: YOUR PROBLEMS SOLVED</p><p>When I try to shut down my PC, the \"task host window\" prevents it.

A new initiative hopes to change that.       When it comes to data, there has been no lack of discussion and debate about ethics in the past years, but formal standards to guide data scientists themselves are still lacking. Now industry bodies in the UK are hoping to change that, as the British Computer Society (BCS), along with the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), have kicked off work to establish industry-wide professional standards in data science .     The objective: to uphold an ethical use of the public's data, and ultimately, make data scientists trusted professionals \u2013 as trusted as doctors, lawyers or architects.    Rebecca George, the president of the BCS, told ZDNet that \"the stars are now aligned\" to gather input from different organizations, and inject them into one central set of rules that will guide the field.   SEE: Managing AI and ML in the enterprise 2020: Tech leaders increase project development and implementation (TechRepublic Premium)   The flood of data generated by the COVID-19 pandemic about various metrics ranging from health to mobility has certainly helped propel the discussion forward. Combined with the imminent departure of the UK from the EU, said George, industry leaders came to realize that establishing a trustworthy data ecosystem should be a top priority.    \"With Brexit, as a country, we are looking at those areas where we have particular strength, and data science is one of them,\" said George. \"There is real desire for the UK to be the most trusted and sought-after country in the world for data science teams. It's good timing, as we look to reset our role in the world, to look at how to make the best use of our resources.\"   But even regardless of current geopolitics and global-health crises, there is no doubt that the role of data science is exploding. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025, 463 exabytes will be created every day globally, and that data will be combined with algorithms to determine everything from credit scores to allocating welfare benefits.      It is important, in this context, that the public know where information is coming from, how it is being used, where it goes, and whether the technologies exploiting data are aligned with public interest. Applying standards to the industry would ensure that data scientists adhere to strong guidelines.   \"This is the hidden critical infrastructure of our world,\" she says. \"We ought to be asking whether the people who are designing, building, and maintaining it are professionally qualified to do the job, and how they can prove it.\"   Many, if not most, technology-oriented organizations already have ethical standards of some sort, which were developed to ensure that innovation is designed responsibly within their own ranks. The BCS, for example, asks practitioners to sign up to a code of conduct , which determines among other principles that IT workers should act in the public interest, with integrity, competence and diligence; and that they should never take on a task that they don't have the skills to complete.   Similarly, the RSS's code of conduct defends acting in the public interest, fulfilling obligations to employers and clients, and showing competence and integrity. And the RAEng is governed by principles of openness, fairness, respect for the law, accuracy and rigor . Even big tech has jumped on the bandwagon, with Google committing to responsible technology , or Microsoft drafting guidelines for 'ethical and trustworthy AI' , to name but two.    But while organizations have been pulling together ethics committees and writing up white papers on the rules that should govern the use of data, not much was done at the individual level. Yet the source of all technology is the brain of those who come up with new ideas. Setting standards for professionals, rather than organizations, could therefore go a long way.   \"Individuals have to sign up to standards as well,\" says George. \"I think that is core to professionalism. It means you always ask the question: 'Why am I being asked to do this, am I doing the right thing and what could be the consequences?'\"   In fact, the BCS and its partners are starting with academia in the effort to set up standards for data science. Working with universities, the group will assess whether academic programs are delivering the right skills and knowledge for those looking to enter the profession, before progressing on to current professional standards.   From day one, therefore, future data scientists will be fed guiding principles for the profession, and it is hoped that they will carry their learnings with them throughout their career. \"If they have been taught to adhere to standards as they go through early education and training, people tend to stick with them as they go into the world of work,\" said George.   In a ripple effect, the whole industry's standards could be uplifted, rather than divided between different organizations coming up with separate, decentralized guidelines and codes.    There is no lack of evidence that the field of data science could benefit from a fresh approach to standards. From an ethical perspective, artificial intelligence is a field that has repeatedly been in the spotlight for the technology's failure to stick to principles of fairness and transparency, with some algorithms set to exacerbate pre-existing biases within society.    It is easy to see how cementing principles of responsibility and dedication to the public's interest into the core of data science from the earliest stages of a professional's development could benefit the industry as a whole.   SEE: Programming language rankings: R makes a comeback but there's debate about its rise   George also mentioned data quality as an important part of the equation. \"Since the start of COVID-19, we have been particularly concerned with planning for unforeseeable situations,\" she says. \"A big part of data science is how you can verify the sources of your data, how you can be sure the data you are using is complete, and that it has been collected in a standard way.\"   For example, she explained, the UK has for a long time registered deaths on a weekly basis \u2013 nowhere near often enough to keep track of the pandemic. When the crisis escalated, new methods had to be found to get data in real-time, while ensuring that it was accurate, pertained to the correct time period, and answered the same question across all the organizations it was collected from.    Having standards in place to regulate these processes would therefore improve the quality of the science in the long run. And equally, it would give immediate backing to data scientists' work. Standards, indeed, could act as a badge of quality for the profession overall.   \"A lot of IT professionals would welcome standards,\" says George, \"because they want to know what they're supposed to be doing, but also how to prove they know what they're doing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42694694883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-JBW1-F07F-838J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Rise</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>RISE</className><className>PFTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: UA4000083885</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHVK</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

A new initiative hopes to change that.       When it comes to data, there has been no lack of discussion and debate about ethics in the past years, but formal standards to guide data scientists themselves are still lacking. Now industry bodies in the UK are hoping to change that, as the British Computer Society (BCS), along with the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), have kicked off work to establish industry-wide professional standards in data science .     The objective: to uphold an ethical use of the public's data, and ultimately, make data scientists trusted professionals \u2013 as trusted as doctors, lawyers or architects.    Rebecca George, the president of the BCS, told ZDNet that \"the stars are now aligned\" to gather input from different organizations, and inject them into one central set of rules that will guide the field.   SEE: Managing AI and ML in the enterprise 2020: Tech leaders increase project development and implementation (TechRepublic Premium)   The flood of data generated by the COVID-19 pandemic about various metrics ranging from health to mobility has certainly helped propel the discussion forward. Combined with the imminent departure of the UK from the EU, said George, industry leaders came to realize that establishing a trustworthy data ecosystem should be a top priority.    \"With Brexit, as a country, we are looking at those areas where we have particular strength, and data science is one of them,\" said George. \"There is real desire for the UK to be the most trusted and sought-after country in the world for data science teams. It's good timing, as we look to reset our role in the world, to look at how to make the best use of our resources.\"   But even regardless of current geopolitics and global-health crises, there is no doubt that the role of data science is exploding. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025, 463 exabytes will be created every day globally, and that data will be combined with algorithms to determine everything from credit scores to allocating welfare benefits.      It is important, in this context, that the public know where information is coming from, how it is being used, where it goes, and whether the technologies exploiting data are aligned with public interest. Applying standards to the industry would ensure that data scientists adhere to strong guidelines.   \"This is the hidden critical infrastructure of our world,\" she says. \"We ought to be asking whether the people who are designing, building, and maintaining it are professionally qualified to do the job, and how they can prove it.\"   Many, if not most, technology-oriented organizations already have ethical standards of some sort, which were developed to ensure that innovation is designed responsibly within their own ranks. The BCS, for example, asks practitioners to sign up to a code of conduct , which determines among other principles that IT workers should act in the public interest, with integrity, competence and diligence; and that they should never take on a task that they don't have the skills to complete.   Similarly, the RSS's code of conduct defends acting in the public interest, fulfilling obligations to employers and clients, and showing competence and integrity. And the RAEng is governed by principles of openness, fairness, respect for the law, accuracy and rigor . Even big tech has jumped on the bandwagon, with Google committing to responsible technology , or Microsoft drafting guidelines for 'ethical and trustworthy AI' , to name but two.    But while organizations have been pulling together ethics committees and writing up white papers on the rules that should govern the use of data, not much was done at the individual level. Yet the source of all technology is the brain of those who come up with new ideas. Setting standards for professionals, rather than organizations, could therefore go a long way.   \"Individuals have to sign up to standards as well,\" says George. \"I think that is core to professionalism. It means you always ask the question: 'Why am I being asked to do this, am I doing the right thing and what could be the consequences?'\"   In fact, the BCS and its partners are starting with academia in the effort to set up standards for data science. Working with universities, the group will assess whether academic programs are delivering the right skills and knowledge for those looking to enter the profession, before progressing on to current professional standards.   From day one, therefore, future data scientists will be fed guiding principles for the profession, and it is hoped that they will carry their learnings with them throughout their career. \"If they have been taught to adhere to standards as they go through early education and training, people tend to stick with them as they go into the world of work,\" said George.   In a ripple effect, the whole industry's standards could be uplifted, rather than divided between different organizations coming up with separate, decentralized guidelines and codes.    There is no lack of evidence that the field of data science could benefit from a fresh approach to standards. From an ethical perspective, artificial intelligence is a field that has repeatedly been in the spotlight for the technology's failure to stick to principles of fairness and transparency, with some algorithms set to exacerbate pre-existing biases within society.    It is easy to see how cementing principles of responsibility and dedication to the public's interest into the core of data science from the earliest stages of a professional's development could benefit the industry as a whole.   SEE: Programming language rankings: R makes a comeback but there's debate about its rise   George also mentioned data quality as an important part of the equation. \"Since the start of COVID-19, we have been particularly concerned with planning for unforeseeable situations,\" she says. \"A big part of data science is how you can verify the sources of your data, how you can be sure the data you are using is complete, and that it has been collected in a standard way.\"   For example, she explained, the UK has for a long time registered deaths on a weekly basis \u2013 nowhere near often enough to keep track of the pandemic. When the crisis escalated, new methods had to be found to get data in real-time, while ensuring that it was accurate, pertained to the correct time period, and answered the same question across all the organizations it was collected from.    Having standards in place to regulate these processes would therefore improve the quality of the science in the long run. And equally, it would give immediate backing to data scientists' work. Standards, indeed, could act as a badge of quality for the profession overall.   \"A lot of IT professionals would welcome standards,\" says George, \"because they want to know what they're supposed to be doing, but also how to prove they know what they're doing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42695646866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-JBW1-F07F-84V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Consumer Credit Scores</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0I5NUVFOTY5RTRCNDNGMkFEMTE0NjZEN0YxN0UzQjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHVK</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

While it is not clear how the government wishes to achieve this, it does have a plan for democratisation of data. Last week, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that the government will be creating a data-stack, and making it freely available to start-ups.

For instance, a start-up in traffic management systems can use data from the government on traffic and create apps to better serve people on the road. Banks and insurance companies will be able to leverage this information to determine agriculture output and crop failure. Such use-cases are expected to multiply as the database widens. The government's track record in building stacks and allowing the private sector to build on them has been phenomenal. If the current development is going to be anything like UPI, where government allowed private banks to build on Aadhaar and mobile details, it is certainly going to spell success. But, it must ensure that it does not over-regulate the use-cases, and can assure people that there will be no cases of privacy breach.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0051973012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBB-0JP1-JB5M-W0MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Initiative &amp;

How is the cloud industry solving the security problem?</p><p>Hammer: Security and information access are top concerns when it comes to cloud computing.</p><p>Without security and availability that is equal to or better than on-premises computing, cloud computing is DOA.</p><p>We get it. Building and delivering solutions with robust security and availability are at the heart of our code.</p><p>Our Simpana (software) features include multi-tenancy, encryption, deduplication, alerting, reporting and data verification. All are critical to help ensure that companies' vital information is safe and highly available.</p><p>IBD: Presidential election years often cause businesses to slow their spending until the results are in. Do you expect the 2012 elections to slow tech and the economy in general?</p><p>Hammer: We have not yet seen any negative impact to our business from the macroeconomic environment; our funnels continue to grow at the required rates.</p><p>However, there is reason to be cautious as there is global macroeconomic uncertainty with indecision around IT budgets for calendar 2012.</p><p>We continue to be cautious on Europe, given the uncertain economic environment and some of the sovereign nation concerns that exist there.</p><p>We are anticipating some type of economic downturn in the first half of calendar 2012 that could negatively impact IT spending, although we haven't seen it yet.</p><p>IBD: What's the answer to maintaining strong growth in problem regions such as Europe?</p><p>Hammer: The shift to the cloud is happening because it can deliver improvements in operations and a reduction in hard costs, which are two very important economic drivers when times are tough.</p><p>However, even in these times data growth will continue to explode at unprecedented rates with the rise of mobile devices and social media in the workplace.</p><p>Regardless of the device or platform, data in every last corner of the company is open to costly regulatory and compliance requirements.</p><p>None of these demands go away in a tough economy.</p><p>IBM: What do you believe will happen to the U.S. and global economies in 2012?</p><p>Hammer: The U.S. economy will improve modestly, growing about 2% and could go as high as 2.5%. Europe will see no growth or a mild recession.</p><p>Global economic growth will be less than the 4.2% growth experienced in 2011, due to slower growth in China, India and Europe. It will slow to about 4%.</p><p>IBD: What will be the big tech trends in 2012?</p><p>Hammer: The massive growth of data, big data, virtualization and compliance; the adoption of private and public clouds; social networking and smart mobile devices are the biggest IT trends heading into 2012.</p><p>We will also see directives from CEOs to find ways to create unique business value from the mountains and silos of data spread throughout the enterprise.</p><p>We are entering the next wave of corporate computing. It's changing how we communicate with our co-workers, customers, prospective customers and suppliers.</p><p>New ways of managing, storing and accessing data are leading to unprecedented ways to create information to help companies grow their businesses.</p><p>Companies who quickly and thoughtfully embrace these changes will be in the best position to accelerate revenue and profits and ultimately help us grow out of the worldwide economic dilemma.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-3832121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54KG-FTT1-JCBB-K2B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Another study concluded that 64 percent of Internet users concerned about privacy have taken action to protect themselves in direct response to the NSA PRISM program' CNN reported[4].<br/>&#x2028;Recently, more than more than 500 of the world's leading authors, including Nobel Prize winners, urged the United Nations to create an international bill of digital rights that would ensure the protection of civil rights in the Internet age, the Guardian reported[5].<br/>&#x2028;Fearing relentless electronic espionage and the erosion of trust on data security, countries like Brazil initiated a series of measures to protect online security[6]. Reportedly, other countries are also working on stricter rules for data handling by US technology companies.<br/>&#x2028;All these developments bring the focus back to technology companies. It is understood that public backlashes has forced them to demand sweeping changes to surveillance laws to preserve the public's trust in the Internet.<br/> A question that could always puzzle citizens world over; why did these reputed technology companies initially cooperate with the government's personal data demands, instead of picking a legal fight?<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://cir.ca/news/tech-companies-push-back-against-fisa\">http://cir.ca/news/tech-companies-push-back-against-fisa</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.financialexpress.com/news/big-tech-companies-lash-out-at-government-snooping/1205792\">http://www.financialexpress.com/news/big-tech-companies-lash-out-at-government-snooping/1205792</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://http//www.pcworld.com/article/2054040/people-flock-to-anonymizing-services-after-nsa-snooping-reports.html\">http://http//www.pcworld.com/article/2054040/people-flock-to-anonymizing-services-after-nsa-snooping-reports.html</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/10/opinion/oppenheim-privacy-reform/?hpt=hp_bn7\">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/10/opinion/oppenheim-privacy-reform/?hpt=hp_bn7</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/surveillance-theft-worlds-leading-authors\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/surveillance-theft-worlds-leading-authors</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dw.de/brazil-wants-internet-independence-from-the-us/a-17134352\">http://www.dw.de/brazil-wants-internet-independence-from-the-us/a-17134352</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO10090313867404858889855107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B1R-NWW1-JCMN-Y3FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>5:41 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 11, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Even those who have nothing to hide are getting more concerned about their privacy.<br/> According to a fall Pew report in the United States, '86% of people have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints. Another study concluded that 64% of Internet users concerned about privacy have taken action to protect themselves in direct response to the NSA PRISM program' CNN reported[10].<br/> Recently more than more than 500 of the world's leading authors, including Nobel Prize winners urged the United Nations to create an international bill of digital rights that would ensure the protection of civil rights in the internet age, the Guardian reported[11].<br/> Fearing relentless electronic espionage and the erosion of trust on data security, countries like Brazil initiated a series of measures to protect online security[12]. Reportedly, other countries are also working on stricter rules for data handling by US technology companies.<br/> All these developments bring the focus back to technology companies. It is understood that public backlashes has forced them to demand sweeping changes to surveillance laws to preserve the public's trust in the internet.<br/> A question that could always puzzle citizens world over; why did these reputed technology companies initially cooperate with the government's personal data demands, instead of picking a legal fight?<br/> *Sources linked to within

Google owner Alphabet Inc's Sundar Pichai, Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple Inc's Tim Cook and Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos deflected accusations from US lawmakers that they crippled smaller competitors in their greed to capture a bigger market share. Pichai, who is the CEO of both Alphabet and Google, took the worst beating from conservatives on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's anti-trust panel. </p><p>The search engine has been accused of stealing content. It apparently used reviews from Yelp Inc and threatened to delist it from search results if it objected. A report will take some time coming but the biggest challenge for the sub-committee would be to establish whether Google and other tech firms operate as illegal monopolies in their areas of dominion. While it is not illegal for a company to be the biggest and the best in its field, exclusionary conduct or monopoly power by disadvantaging and harming competitors is not permitted. This is because after establishing a monopoly, companies may squeeze suppliers or impose higher prices on consumers. For instance, Google's search business stifles rivals by favouring its own services while its subsidiary YouTube pushes content to users. Mostly, answers to common questions can be found in \"answer boxes\" at the top of a results page. Google gets those facts/news from other websites as a result of which users don't visit the sites of the original content. This starves other websites of valuable traffic and revenue. Plus, Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on the Safari web browser on iPhones and iPads. Rival firms will never get a level-playing field if the search engine corners such a significant market share.</p><p>Apart from genuine worries about monopoly and ethics of business, this review can be said to be a part of the Trump administration's bid to bring the big technology firms to heel for what is mostly considered to be their anti-Republican attitude. President Trump has had a number of run-ins with many of them and has even threatened to take action against them with executive orders. In fact, Republican Jim Jordan, who was part of the hearing, accused these firms of being \"out to get conservatives.\" It is time for US regulators to mull if the existing rules are sufficient to rein in these behemoths given their market power and if the laws should be amended. That again is a long haul.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Although heavygoing, it provides a vital analysis of the digital economy and our place in it. Zuboff, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, rejects that overused maxim about internet companies - \"If you're not paying for it, you're the product\"- in favour of a more stinging verdict: the behavioural data we unthinkingly hand over is the raw material these firms package up and sell. So what does that make us? We are like elephants killed for their tusks, Zuboff argues: \"You are not the product. You are the abandoned carcass.\"</p><p>An easier read in a similar vein is Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech (Allen Lane \u00a320) by Rana Foroohar, a Financial Times journalist.

Perhaps most interesting are Simons's political links: he was the largest donor to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, while his former co-CEO at Renaissance Technologies, Robert Mercer, was the biggest contributor to Donald Trump's.</p><p>Too many business autobiographies are vanity projects for the inflated egos of chief executives who pay ghostwriters handsomely to translate their corporate spiel into \"man of destiny\" tales. The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons in Creative Leadership (Bantam Press \u00a320) by Robert Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, is rather better. It starts with a crisis - an alligator has killed a toddler at Disney World while Iger is supposed to be focusing on the opening of its Shanghai resort - and ends with his business bon mots. c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Taxi man Travis Kalanick</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155230339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMN-04H1-JCBW-N3V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 1, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Although heavygoing, it provides a vital analysis of the digital economy and our place in it. Zuboff, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, rejects that overused maxim about internet companies - \"If you're not paying for it, you're the product\"- in favour of a more stinging verdict: the behavioural data we unthinkingly hand over is the raw material these firms package up and sell. So what does that make us? We are like elephants killed for their tusks, Zuboff argues: \"You are not the product. You are the abandoned carcass.\"</p><p>An easier read in a similar vein is Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech (Allen Lane \u00a320) by Rana Foroohar, a Financial Times journalist. The title refers to Google's motto, and the book examines how far the biggest technology companies have drifted from their founding principles. There are some eye-opening stats here - the wealth of Faang (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), for example, now exceeds the economy of France. But most powerful is the warning that Foroohar issues: tech companies could spark the next financial crash, as they venture ever further into the world of banking, almost unfettered by regulation.</p><p>Moving from the new masters of the universe to their predecessors, The Man Who Solved the Market by Gregory Zuckerman (Portfolio Penguin \u00a320) is the story of Jim Simons, a secretive hedge-fund manager who pioneered algorithmic forecasting in finance. Perhaps most interesting are Simons's political links: he was the largest donor to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, while his former co-CEO at Renaissance Technologies, Robert Mercer, was the biggest contributor to Donald Trump's.</p><p>Too many business autobiographies are vanity projects for the inflated egos of chief executives who pay ghostwriters handsomely to translate their corporate spiel into \"man of destiny\" tales. The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons in Creative Leadership (Bantam Press \u00a320) by Robert Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, is rather better. It starts with a crisis - an alligator has killed a toddler at Disney World while Iger is supposed to be focusing on the opening of its Shanghai resort - and ends with his business bon mots. c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Taxi man Travis Kalanick</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155232681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMN-04H1-JCBW-N394-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 1, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

To get free online services, she laments, they hand over intimate information to technology firms. \"Personal data are much more valuable than you think,\" she says. To highlight this sorry state of affairs, Ms Morone has resorted to what she calls \"extreme capitalism\": she registered herself as a company in Delaware in an effort to exploit her personal data for financial gain. She created dossiers containing different subsets of data, which she displayed in a London gallery in 2016 and offered for sale, starting at \u00a3100 ($135). The entire collection, including her health data and social-security number, can be had for \u00a37,000.</p><p>Only a few buyers have taken her up on this offer and she finds \"the whole thing really absurd\". Yet if the job of the artist is to anticipate the Zeitgeist, Ms Morone was dead on: this year the world has discovered that something is rotten in the data economy. Since it emerged in March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, had acquired data on 87m Facebook users in underhand ways, voices calling for a rethink of the handling of online personal data have only grown louder. Even Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, recently called for a price to be put on personal data, asking researchers to come up with solutions.</p><p>Given the current state of digital affairs, in which the collection and exploitation of personal data is dominated by big tech firms, Ms Morone's approach, in which individuals offer their data for sale, seems unlikely to catch on. But what if people really controlled their data\u2014and the tech giants were required to pay for access? What would such a data economy look like?</p><p>It would not be the first time that an important economic resource had gone from simply being used to being owned and traded; the same has already happened with land and water, for example. But digital information seems an unlikely candidate to be allocated by markets. Unlike physical resources, personal data are an example of what economists call \"non-rival\" goods, meaning they can be used more than once. In fact, the more they are used, the better for society. And frequent leaks show how difficult it can be to control data. But another historical precedent might provide a model\u2014and also chimes with contemporary concerns about \"technofeudalism\", argue Jaron Lanier, a virtual-reality pioneer, and Glen Weyl, an economist at Yale University, who both work for Microsoft Research. </p><p>Labour, like data, is a resource that is hard to pin down. Workers were not properly compensated for labour for most of human history. Even once people were free to sell their labour, it took decades for wages to reach liveable levels on average. History won't repeat itself, but chances are that it will rhyme, Mr Weyl predicts in \"Radical Markets\", a provocative new book he has co-written with Eric Posner of the University of Chicago. He argues that in the age of artificial intelligence, it makes sense to treat data as a form of labour.</p><p>To understand why, it helps to keep in mind that \"artificial intelligence\" is something of a misnomer. Messrs Weyl and Posner call it \"collective intelligence\": most <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> algorithms need to be trained using reams of human-generated examples, in a process called machine learning. Unless they know what the right answers (provided by humans) are meant to be, algorithms cannot translate languages, understand speech or recognise objects in images. Data provided by humans can thus be seen as a form of labour which powers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis>. As the data economy grows up, such data work will take many forms. Much of it will be passive, as people engage in all kinds of activities\u2014liking social-media posts, listening to music, recommending restaurants\u2014that generate the data needed to power new services. But some people's data work will be more active, as they make decisions (such as labelling images or steering a car through a busy city) that can be used as the basis for training <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> systems.</p><p>Yet whether such data are generated actively or passively, few people will have the time or inclination to keep track of all the information they generate, or estimate its value. Even those who do will lack the bargaining power to get a good deal from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> firms. But the history of labour offers a hint about how things could evolve: because historically, if wages rose to acceptable levels, it was mostly due to unions. Similarly, Mr Weyl expects to see the rise of what he calls \"data-labour unions\", organisations that serve as gatekeepers of people's data. Like their predecessors, they will negotiate rates, monitor members' data work and ensure the quality of their digital output, for instance by keeping reputation scores. Unions could funnel specialist data work to their members and even organise strikes, for instance by blocking access to exert influence on a company employing its members' data. Similarly, data unions could be conduits channelling members' data contributions, all while tracking them and billing <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> firms that benefit from them. </p><p>All this may sound like science fiction. Why should Google and Facebook, for instance, ever give up their current business model of using free data to sell targeted online advertising? In 2017 they raked in a combined $135bn in ad dollars. If they had to compensate people for their data, they would be much less profitable. Meanwhile, startups such as CitizenMe and Datacoup, which can be seen as early forms of data unions, have so far failed to make much headway. Yet in other corners of the industry, tech giants already pay for data, although they are careful not to talk too much about it. Mostly through outsourcing firms, they employ armies of raters and moderators to check the quality of their algorithms and take down content that is illegal or offensive. Other firms use crowd-working platforms, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, to farm out data work such as tagging pictures. Mighty <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis>, a startup based in Seattle, pays thousands of online workers to label images of the street scenes that are used to train the algorithms that power self-driving cars.</p><p>What is more, if <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> lives up to the hype, it will lead to demand for more and better data. As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> services get more sophisticated, algorithms will need to be fed a higher-quality diet of digital information, which people may only provide if they get paid. Once one big tech firm starts paying for data, others may have to follow.</p><p>Treating data as labour means tech giants' profit margins are likely to get squeezed, but their overall business may get bigger. And workers will, at least partially, be in the driving seat. Their mornings might start with checking a dashboard provided by their data-labour union, showing a personalised list of available jobs: from watching advertising (the computer's camera collects facial reactions) to translating a text into a rare language, to exploring a virtual building to see how easy it is to navigate. The dashboard might also list past earnings, show ratings and suggest new skills. </p><p>But much still needs to happen for personal data to be widely considered as labour, and paid for as such. For one thing, the right legal framework will be needed to encourage the emergence of a new data economy. The European Union's new General DataProtection Regulation, which came into effect in May, already gives people extensive rights to check, download and even delete personal data held by companies. Second, the technology to keep track of data flows needs to become much more capable. Research to calculate the value of particular data to an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> service is in its infancy. </p><p>Third, and most important, people will have to develop a \"class consciousness\" as data workers. Most people say they want their personal information to be protected, but then trade it away for nearly nothing, something known as the \"privacy paradox\". Yet things may be changing: more than 90% of Americans think being in control of who can get data on them is important, according to the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank.</p><p>Even if people got money for their data, sceptics say, they wouldn't get much. If Facebook shared out its profits across all its monthly users, for instance, each would get just $9 a year. But such calculations fail to recognise that the data age has only just begun. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis> is often likened to electricity, and when electrification began in the late 19th century, entire cities used only as much power as a single household does today. </p><p>Wouldn't this data economy be hugely unequal? Some people's data will surely be worth much more than others'. But Mr Weyl argues that the skills needed to generate valuable data may be more widely spread than you might think, so data work could disrupt the standard hierarchy of human capital. One way or another, societies will have to find a mechanism to distribute the wealth created by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AI</emphasis>. As things stand, most of it accrues to the big data distilleries. Unless this changes, social inequality could revert to medieval levels, Mr Weyl warns. If that happens, it is not unreasonable to assume that one day, the data workers of the world will unite. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-8877TQL</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR4-9D01-JBKN-B2M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

He asked how many were on Facebook. One hand went up. The rest regarded Facebook as some ridiculous and intrusive thing their parents did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They see it,\" he tells me, \"as the platform of their parents and grandparents. They are horrified by how they post photos of their vacations with them in them. They see this as an absurd, indiscriminate posting of life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The catch is that the kids were all on WhatsApp and Instagram, both owned by Facebook. Even so, on top of the leaks of user data, the political meddling, the cack-handed cover-up and, last week, the immensely damaging email cache published by British MPs, the news that the kids find this social medium desperately uncool is one more reputational horror Facebook could do without. Nobody actually likes this company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Whenever there's something especially creepy,\" says Eggers, \"or especially duplicitous, it seems to come from Facebook. There's something culturally wrong at Facebook.\"</p><p>We've come to expect tone deafness from the Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, but now Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer, has been embarrassingly implicated in the creation of this culture. She was a hero of women in the workplace, the founder of LeanIn.org, which offers women \"ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals\". But the revelations about Facebook's attempts to cover up its part in Russian meddling in the 2016 American presidential election revealed she was a key player, an active participant in attempts to smear the company's critics.</p><p>As if that weren't bad enough for Sandberg, she has now been attacked even by the sainted Michelle Obama.</p><p>\"That whole 'so you can have it all'. Nope, not at the same time,\" Obama said. \"That's a lie. And it's not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn't work all the time.\"</p><p>The emails released by MPs may prove the most serious threat of all to the company. They show a deliberate crushing of competitors - possibly opening a route to an unfair-competition action - even more ruthless harvesting of users' data and the sale of it to selected companies and covert trawling for information about competitors. The charge list is long and getting longer.</p><p>Nothing, in the circumstances, could be more topical than the talk Eggers is to give for this year's PEN HG Wells lecture in London. He is to speak on digital human rights: it is 70 years since the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was a development of Wells's 1940 essay The Rights of Man.</p><p>Others have made statements of digital human rights - notably Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, and Stefano Quintarelli, an Italian politician and IT expert - but they talk about rights when you're already online. Eggers wants something more.</p><p>\"What I want to add is that as a society we really have to reverse or slow down what seems to be a headlong move toward every aspect of our lives, from social to civil to political, having to be conducted in the digital world. An essential human right should be that we should be able to participate as citizens without having to do so in the digital world. There should always be an analogue option.\"</p><p>This strikes me as brilliant - digital rights would not be rights at all if they did not include a right to be non-digital, a status that, as the damning evidence piles up, may well become widely desired.</p><p>Eggers has been lecturing about online evils since 2013, when his novel The Circle was published, a Brave New World or Nineteen Eighty-Four for millennials and snowflakes. The Circle is a tech company, a combination of Facebook and Google, with dreams of world domination. It would achieve this primarily by eliminating privacy. Everybody ends up watching everybody else all the time, except during three-minute \"bathroom breaks\".</p><p>The book was partly inspired by something Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, said: \"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\" So Silicon Valley claims moral authority over us all.</p><p>\"Schmidt has said some of the most concerning things - they gave me a real chill. You feel privacy is only for deviants.\"</p><p>Will any of the big companies co-operate in this attempt to make them decent organisations? Google and Facebook have signed up to new internet standards designed by Berners-Lee that require companies to respect data privacy. But does that mean anything?</p><p>\"I always thought that at least some of the major tech companies would accept some kind of regulatory framework if it were based on a commonsense understanding of morality, decency and democracy.\" This is naive, Eggers now admits, because there is a \"profound lack of humility\" in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"It's one of the foundational problems with these companies. They walk in the door with the sense that they are the centre of the universe and the smartest people on the planet and their company is the most influential of all time.</p><p>\"That can lead to some terrible outcomes. They should have a more humble approach to their work and their place in the world. Also an awareness of their power and an awareness that they are just a tech company, sellers of emojis and frivolities. If they were a little bit more humble from top to bottom, I think we could have a conversation about regulation and basic human rights.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the US political landscape is now so opposed to regulation of any kind, nothing is likely to happen. Eggers also sees little hope that other obvious ways to tame Silicon Valley will be used - for instance, legally defining the giants as publishers, which would make them responsible for their content, or breaking them up with competition laws.</p><p>\"There's no appetite for these things. The last time major monopolies were broken up was the phone companies and that was 40 years ago.</p><p>\"They are publishers, because these words online are permanent: they are able to be seen by thousands and millions of people. Of course they're publishers. But they've been dodging that and they will continue to do so. For whatever reason, tech companies remain above the law.\"</p><p>We are all to blame, he says. Users submit to highly addictive software and gadgets, affecting themselves and their children in the process. \"The more we require schoolchildren to do their work online, to spend more time in front of their screens, the more we are guiding them into a world we know is not good for them.\"</p><p>He compares the state of the internet companies to that of Big Tobacco in the early 1990s: the evidence against them is overwhelming but still we remain addicts.</p><p>Eggers himself uses a basic LG flip phone. He writes on a 14-year-old Apple Mac that is not connected to the internet. He checks his emails on another machine a couple of times a day.</p><p>\"All the old software still works and I don't have to submit myself to indentured servitude to Adobe or some other company.\"</p><p>Overall, though, he's optimistic. The Texas teenagers were no longer in thrall to the Valley giants and regarded their parents' screen addiction with dismay. He even detects signs that Zuckerberg is waking from his moral slumber, putting money into philanthropy and maybe even considering the possibility that he does not own the future. A lengthening list of smart Valley apostates are leaving, in disgust, these companies that peddle addiction.</p><p>\"All the power lies in the hands of users. They should use that power and opt out and move their money and their eyeballs elsewhere.</p><p>\"You can enact radical shifts. These things have only been around a few years, but we think of them as a permanent aspect of life. They shouldn't be.\"</p><p>Or, as Michelle Obama said so pithily of Sandberg's Lean In manifesto, \"that shit doesn't work all the time\". In the case of tech companies, one might add: \"If ever.\"</p><p>                   Dave Eggers will give the PEN HG Wells lecture at the Bridge Theatre, London SE1, at 5.30pm on Sunday 16 December (                   bridgetheatre.co.uk                   bridgetheatre.co.uk                   )                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-49912886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXG-JYG1-F021-6290-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 9, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So you guys are out with a new SurveyMonkey mobile app. And this is the first time you've ever had an app, right?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: That's correct.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: We just launched this about a week and a half ago.</p><p/><p>CHANG: So tell me about it.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So basically...</p><p/><p>CHANG: I've actually got it right here.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Right. So what we wanted to do was take for people the power of SurveyMonkey on the Web and give them those capabilities to create surveys, send them out and analyze the data on a mobile device. More and more people are living on their tablets, on their smart phones, and, you know, we've never had a full functioned SurveyMonkey app to do the creation and analytic side of mobile.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Now, we're going to showcase a few of the surveys on our show...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: -- for this hour. One of them, the Bitcoin survey, we just put this out there an hour ago. We already have 100 responses.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: I mean what's the kind of speed that you can get these surveys done at?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, I mean I think that's the point, is like you have a quick question. You know, you're on the go. You know, you want to ask a question. We've got a six question survey. We just pulled it together. We Tweeted it out. It got over 100 responses already. And people are going to come in and you're going to see the responses in real time. And we'll see them as they come in during the show.</p><p/><p>CHANG: So we're going to do a survey on Bitcoin. We're going to do a survey on mobile devices, Samsung versus Apple, also, on CEO HomeAway, Brian Sharples, is with us. We're going to do a survey on the sharing economy and how often people use these services.</p><p/><p>My question is, how many businesses really need surveys on the go?</p><p/><p>Do they really need such a fast response?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So, I think sometimes you want to create a quick survey to go. A lot of times, our existing users just want to check their surveys. But I've used it quite frequently that like I put a survey out in the field and then I'm like, oh, people aren't quite understanding this question. I want to change the question.</p><p/><p>So I go in, I edit the question. I had created it on the Web, but I wanted to edit the question real time. And then I'm seeing the results as they're coming in.</p><p/><p>So it's kind of all of those things together.</p><p/><p>CHANG: How many surveys are you guys doing a day, about?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: We do, you know, 50,000 surveys get created a day, something like that.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So it's large numbers of surveys being created a day. And we're seeing -- the app has been very popular. We've got over 100,000 downloads in the first week.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: And so it...</p><p/><p>CHANG: And pretty good reviews in the app store.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: And good reviews.</p><p/><p>CHANG: I know that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So we're excited about it. It's still early. We're launching in more countries. We are coming up with the Android version. So there's a lot more to do in mobile.</p><p/><p>CHANG: All right. Well, all of the surveys, all three of those surveys I mentioned, we've Tweeted those out from our @BloombergWest account. You can answer them there. And we will get to them later in the show.</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>CHANG: I mean, Dave, you run a big tech company.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: What do you look for in a CFO?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I mean I think you want someone, in a public company in particular, that investors will trust, that -- I mean the CFO is the trustee, in essence, of the financials. And so that's like the critical thing in some place like Apple. And then, you know, how do they think about, in Apple's case, the problem of too much cash?</p><p/><p>That's the question investors, I think, want to know from the CFO. But that's not just his decision, right?</p><p/><p>That's Tim's decision at the end of the day, too.</p><p/><p>But that's certainly what Peter has been spending the last year-and-a- half on, wrestling with Carl Icahn and all those kind of issues.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Right. He does have quite an extensive resume. He was CFO of Xerox, CFO of Nokia Siemens, CFO of GM Europe.</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST.</p><p/><p>I'm Emily Chang with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg, CEO of SurveyMonkey.</p><p/><p>We're going to talk about one of our surveys that we've been running - - you guys have been running for us. It is a battle of the 5. Samsung just released its Galaxy S5 in Barcelona last week. You were at Mobile World Congress.</p><p/><p>Apple also has the 5S, the 5C.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: There have been some doubts about how well the 5C has been doing. So we talked to customers and asked them if they really wanted to upgrade.</p><p/><p>But first, you know, when you were at Mobile World Congress, what sort of sense did you get about the health of the smartphone market?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So...</p><p/><p>CHANG: -- and a willingness to change?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So there were a lot of people there. It was about 80,000 people. It felt like CES with all the booths and things like that. But there was not a lot of excitement like people were talking about, oh, you've got to see this or you've got to see that.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Right. And they unveiled the Galaxy S5. You know, there was sort of silence...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. It was...</p><p/><p>CHANG: -- I would say.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: -- it was not an overwhelming wow! It was more like, oh, this is incremental and nice. And I think it's an interesting thing, because it's -- Samsung has seemed very innovative and kind of outpacing Apple, but yet Apple got sort of that same reaction to the 5S.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Right.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: And are we kind of reaching the limit for all these people?</p><p/><p>So we got -- we ran the survey. You know, 17 percent of the people said they owned a Samsung Galaxy, which is high. Fifty-seven percent said they had no intention of upgrading.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So people are pretty happy with their 4.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Even though this one, you can actually drop it in water?</p><p/><p>That's what I thought was the coolest feature.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: You could drop it in water...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I mean it -- there are some...</p><p/><p>CHANG: And it will be OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: There are some cool features, but we seem to be slowing down on the features that people really want.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Right. It's very incremental, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Now, what -- the survey, though, the thing that did come back that people really want -- and this is hard to do and it's not something you're going to get done in a year -- people want longer battery life.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Yes. I agree.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So we've got these big phones with great screens and they can do amazing things and then they die on you.</p><p/><p>CHANG: If I knew I could get a phone where the battery would guarantee to last me all day long...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So that was the single biggest thing people want.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK, what about...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Not screen size...</p><p/><p>CHANG: -- the iPhone?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Not anything else.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Right, because, actually, I'm curious, when it comes to the iPhone, would people be willing to upgrade if Apple came out with a bigger screen?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I'm sure there's going to be people, but we did not see screen size as the big thing that people wanted. We saw battery life. You know, there was also not much sort of interest from Apple users in -- who don't not have a 5S buying a 5S.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: And we've seen some discounting going on.</p><p/><p>CHANG: What about the 5C?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: No interest at all. Ninety-three percent said they don't own it and most of them don't have any interest.</p><p/><p>CHANG: It's interesting, sometimes I wonder if the billboards on the 101 are a signal of what Apple is trying to push, because there are so many 5C billboards. And, you know, I wonder, is it -- is it dead in the water?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: It certainly looks like it has not found its niche. I think people thought it was going to be a lot cheaper. You can see in the survey that price is something people care about. So -- but it isn't that cheap.</p><p/><p>CHANG: They do want a smart watch, though, from Apple, don't they?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. So the data people are really excited.</p><p/><p>CHANG: It's the product that doesn't exist yet, by the way.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. I think it's probably the most interesting, is that people are much more excited about a smart watch than they are about Google Glass. We've seen that continuously. And they want a smart watch from Apple. They believe Apple will create a great smart watch.</p><p/><p>CHANG: All right. Well, we've got a couple more surveys coming up, one about travel.</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>CHANG: And Bitcoin is bouncing back, trading today at $668. This just a week after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and went offline. SurveyMonkey fielded a survey for us to get your opinion about this. The CEO of SurveyMonkey, Dave Goldberg, here with us now.</p><p/><p>I don't understand why the price of Bitcoin is going up after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox. But, hey, we're going to get to that in a moment.</p><p/><p>You guys actually did a survey about Bitcoin.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Let's walk through it.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: We've been doing it through the show and, actually...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So it was actually interesting. Like two-thirds of the people, 64 percent, have said they they've heard of Bitcoin.</p><p/><p>CHANG: So most people know about this.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And there's been a lot of talk about it. But very few people are actually using it...</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: -- for anything, which make sense and...</p><p/><p>CHANG: So have you ever bought or sold Bitcoin?</p><p/><p>Only 11 percent said yes.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And...</p><p/><p>CHANG: I have $10, by the way.</p><p/><p>Do you have any bitcoins?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I do own Bitcoin. I'm skeptical about it as a currency for transaction, but I think it's interesting as a replacement for things like gold. So like a store of value versus a -- so everyone is excited about it being a currency for buying and selling things.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I'm less excited about that, but I think...</p><p/><p>CHANG: More a commodity?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: More like a commodity, but a, you know, a better thing to store your wealth in than gold in a place like Argentina or Iran.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Are you nervous, though, about it getting stolen?</p><p/><p>I mean, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin disappeared from Mt. Gox. There's no trace of it.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so I think you've got to -- I think we're going to see a change in the Bitcoin economy. A lot of stuff was getting funded. And the first thing people are going to want is security.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: I want to know that this is going to be safe, that it's going to be insured. I mean, a lot of the things we have in the regular banking and regulatory system, people are going to want with Bitcoin in order for it to continue to go up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANG: All right. And by the way, guys, you can continue to answer this survey during the show.</p><p/><p>OK, number three, have you ever encountered an establishment that uses Bitcoin or accepts Bitcoin?</p><p/><p>Most people said no, but still 20 percent...</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Twenty percent. I thought that was higher than I was...</p><p/><p>CHANG: That's not bad.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: -- than I would have guessed.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: How likely are you use it in the future?</p><p/><p>You know, we got about 12 percent that said they were extremely very likely, which is -- that's actually pretty good, considering this is something that most people aren't using today, so...</p><p/><p>CHANG: Not at all likely, 54 percent, though.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK. And then the final question, how likely is it that Bitcoin will become a widely accepted form of currency?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yeas, 16 percent said extremely or very likely. It's low, but, again, for something that very few people actually own and we had a major meltdown last week, it's not bad. But, yes, I mean, a lot of people think, you know, more than half think it's not at all likely.</p><p/><p>CHANG: How diverse are the SurveyMonkey answers, the responses?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Well, this one is a little different. So, you know, when we did the mobile survey, that was through our SurveyMonkey audience panel.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: But this one is just -- you know, we've posted it. This is just anybody who wants to come in.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So this one isn't particularly scientific, it's more kind of fun.</p><p/><p>CHANG: But pretty diverse, right?</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: But pretty diverse and we're getting, you know, we're getting people coming through BLOOMBERG WEST to sort of answer it, as well.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: So it's hard to say.</p><p/><p>CHANG: All right.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: But interesting.</p><p/><p>CHANG: Well, we're going to go on a deep dive into Bitcoin now.</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST, here with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg of SurveyMonkey. we've been asking our viewers throughout the hour to respond to some surveys. We're talking about how people book their travel.</p><p/><p>Let's look at some of the things that we found.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so, I mean, we asked people how often they use the home or apartment site to book their travel. And it was...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: -- a home sharing site...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Right. And it was pretty small. It was like...</p><p/><p>CHANG: Seventy percent saying never.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: Right. But about 6 percent were always or usually. So I think it's a very -- the group who does it is very passionate, but it's small.</p><p/><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p/><p>GOLDBERG: And then I think we asked how people typically book travel. And a lot of times it's through, you know, hotel Web sites directly. It's sort of a big use case. But we got 4 percent to say vacation rental sites such as VRBO. So, you know, I think that's the main thing.</p><p/><p>I think one of the things that came back is why would you not list your property?</p><p/><p>And most people said not knowing the people I'd be renting to. Forty- two percent were -- that was their concern.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2014 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

We already have 100 responses.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: I mean what's the kind of speed that you can get these surveys done at?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, I mean I think that's the point, is like you have a quick question. You know, you're on the go. You know, you want to ask a question. We've got a six question survey. We just pulled it together. We Tweeted it out. It got over 100 responses already. And people are going to come in and you're going to see the responses in real time. And we'll see them as they come in during the show.</p><p>CHANG: So we're going to do a survey on Bitcoin. We're going to do a survey on mobile devices, Samsung versus Apple, also, on CEO HomeAway, Brian Sharples, is with us. We're going to do a survey on the sharing economy and how often people use these services.</p><p>My question is, how many businesses really need surveys on the go?</p><p>Do they really need such a fast response?</p><p>GOLDBERG: So, I think sometimes you want to create a quick survey to go. A lot of times, our existing users just want to check their surveys. But I've used it quite frequently that like I put a survey out in the field and then I'm like, oh, people aren't quite understanding this question. I want to change the question.</p><p>So I go in, I edit the question. I had created it on the Web, but I wanted to edit the question real time. And then I'm seeing the results as they're coming in.</p><p>So it's kind of all of those things together.</p><p>CHANG: How many surveys are you guys doing a day, about?</p><p>GOLDBERG: We do, you know, 50,000 surveys get created a day, something like that.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So it's large numbers of surveys being created a day. And we're seeing -- the app has been very popular. We've got over 100,000 downloads in the first week.</p><p>CHANG: Oh, wow!</p><p>GOLDBERG: And so it...</p><p>CHANG: And pretty good reviews in the app store.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And good reviews.</p><p>CHANG: I know that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GOLDBERG: So we're excited about it. It's still early. We're launching in more countries. We are coming up with the Android version. So there's a lot more to do in mobile.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Well, all of the surveys, all three of those surveys I mentioned, we've Tweeted those out from our @BloombergWest account. You can answer them there. And we will get to them later in the show.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: I mean, Dave, you run a big tech company.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: What do you look for in a CFO?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean I think you want someone, in a public company in particular, that investors will trust, that -- I mean the CFO is the trustee, in essence, of the financials. And so that's like the critical thing in some place like Apple. And then, you know, how do they think about, in Apple's case, the problem of too much cash?</p><p>That's the question investors, I think, want to know from the CFO. But that's not just his decision, right?</p><p>That's Tim's decision at the end of the day, too.</p><p>But that's certainly what Peter has been spending the last year-and-a- half on, wrestling with Carl Icahn and all those kind of issues.</p><p>CHANG: Right. He does have quite an extensive resume. He was CFO of Xerox, CFO of Nokia Siemens, CFO of GM Europe.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST.</p><p>I'm Emily Chang with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg, CEO of SurveyMonkey.</p><p>We're going to talk about one of our surveys that we've been running - - you guys have been running for us. It is a battle of the 5. Samsung just released its Galaxy S5 in Barcelona last week. You were at Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Apple also has the 5S, the 5C.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: There have been some doubts about how well the 5C has been doing. So we talked to customers and asked them if they really wanted to upgrade.</p><p>But first, you know, when you were at Mobile World Congress, what sort of sense did you get about the health of the smartphone market?</p><p>GOLDBERG: So...</p><p>CHANG: -- and a willingness to change?</p><p>GOLDBERG: So there were a lot of people there. It was about 80,000 people. It felt like CES with all the booths and things like that. But there was not a lot of excitement like people were talking about, oh, you've got to see this or you've got to see that.</p><p>CHANG: Right. And they unveiled the Galaxy S5. You know, there was sort of silence...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. It was...</p><p>CHANG: -- I would say.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- it was not an overwhelming wow! It was more like, oh, this is incremental and nice. And I think it's an interesting thing, because it's -- Samsung has seemed very innovative and kind of outpacing Apple, but yet Apple got sort of that same reaction to the 5S.</p><p>CHANG: Right.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And are we kind of reaching the limit for all these people?</p><p>So we got -- we ran the survey. You know, 17 percent of the people said they owned a Samsung Galaxy, which is high. Fifty-seven percent said they had no intention of upgrading.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So people are pretty happy with their 4.</p><p>CHANG: Even though this one, you can actually drop it in water?</p><p>That's what I thought was the coolest feature.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: You could drop it in water...</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean it -- there are some...</p><p>CHANG: And it will be OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: There are some cool features, but we seem to be slowing down on the features that people really want.</p><p>CHANG: Right. It's very incremental, isn't it?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Now, what -- the survey, though, the thing that did come back that people really want -- and this is hard to do and it's not something you're going to get done in a year -- people want longer battery life.</p><p>CHANG: Yes. I agree.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So we've got these big phones with great screens and they can do amazing things and then they die on you.</p><p>CHANG: If I knew I could get a phone where the battery would guarantee to last me all day long...</p><p>GOLDBERG: So that was the single biggest thing people want.</p><p>CHANG: OK, what about...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Not screen size...</p><p>CHANG: -- the iPhone?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Not anything else.</p><p>CHANG: Right, because, actually, I'm curious, when it comes to the iPhone, would people be willing to upgrade if Apple came out with a bigger screen?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I'm sure there's going to be people, but we did not see screen size as the big thing that people wanted. We saw battery life. You know, there was also not much sort of interest from Apple users in -- who don't not have a 5S buying a 5S.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And we've seen some discounting going on.</p><p>CHANG: What about the 5C?</p><p>GOLDBERG: No interest at all. Ninety-three percent said they don't own it and most of them don't have any interest.</p><p>CHANG: It's interesting, sometimes I wonder if the billboards on the 101 are a signal of what Apple is trying to push, because there are so many 5C billboards. And, you know, I wonder, is it -- is it dead in the water?</p><p>GOLDBERG: It certainly looks like it has not found its niche. I think people thought it was going to be a lot cheaper. You can see in the survey that price is something people care about. So -- but it isn't that cheap.</p><p>CHANG: They do want a smart watch, though, from Apple, don't they?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. So the data people are really excited.</p><p>CHANG: It's the product that doesn't exist yet, by the way.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. I think it's probably the most interesting, is that people are much more excited about a smart watch than they are about Google Glass. We've seen that continuously. And they want a smart watch from Apple. They believe Apple will create a great smart watch.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Well, we've got a couple more surveys coming up, one about travel.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: And Bitcoin is bouncing back, trading today at $668. This just a week after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and went offline. SurveyMonkey fielded a survey for us to get your opinion about this. The CEO of SurveyMonkey, Dave Goldberg, here with us now.</p><p>I don't understand why the price of Bitcoin is going up after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox. But, hey, we're going to get to that in a moment.</p><p>You guys actually did a survey about Bitcoin.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: Let's walk through it.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: We've been doing it through the show and, actually...</p><p>GOLDBERG: So it was actually interesting. Like two-thirds of the people, 64 percent, have said they they've heard of Bitcoin.</p><p>CHANG: So most people know about this.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And there's been a lot of talk about it. But very few people are actually using it...</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- for anything, which make sense and...</p><p>CHANG: So have you ever bought or sold Bitcoin?</p><p>Only 11 percent said yes.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And...</p><p>CHANG: I have $10, by the way.</p><p>Do you have any bitcoins?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I do own Bitcoin. I'm skeptical about it as a currency for transaction, but I think it's interesting as a replacement for things like gold. So like a store of value versus a -- so everyone is excited about it being a currency for buying and selling things.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I'm less excited about that, but I think...</p><p>CHANG: More a commodity?</p><p>GOLDBERG: More like a commodity, but a, you know, a better thing to store your wealth in than gold in a place like Argentina or Iran.</p><p>CHANG: Are you nervous, though, about it getting stolen?</p><p>I mean, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin disappeared from Mt. Gox. There's no trace of it.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so I think you've got to -- I think we're going to see a change in the Bitcoin economy. A lot of stuff was getting funded. And the first thing people are going to want is security.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I want to know that this is going to be safe, that it's going to be insured. I mean, a lot of the things we have in the regular banking and regulatory system, people are going to want with Bitcoin in order for it to continue to go up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANG: All right. And by the way, guys, you can continue to answer this survey during the show.</p><p>OK, number three, have you ever encountered an establishment that uses Bitcoin or accepts Bitcoin?</p><p>Most people said no, but still 20 percent...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Twenty percent. I thought that was higher than I was...</p><p>CHANG: That's not bad.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- than I would have guessed.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: How likely are you use it in the future?</p><p>You know, we got about 12 percent that said they were extremely very likely, which is -- that's actually pretty good, considering this is something that most people aren't using today, so...</p><p>CHANG: Not at all likely, 54 percent, though.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: OK. And then the final question, how likely is it that Bitcoin will become a widely accepted form of currency?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yeas, 16 percent said extremely or very likely. It's low, but, again, for something that very few people actually own and we had a major meltdown last week, it's not bad. But, yes, I mean, a lot of people think, you know, more than half think it's not at all likely.</p><p>CHANG: How diverse are the SurveyMonkey answers, the responses?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Well, this one is a little different. So, you know, when we did the mobile survey, that was through our SurveyMonkey audience panel.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: But this one is just -- you know, we've posted it. This is just anybody who wants to come in.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So this one isn't particularly scientific, it's more kind of fun.</p><p>CHANG: But pretty diverse, right?</p><p>GOLDBERG: But pretty diverse and we're getting, you know, we're getting people coming through BLOOMBERG WEST to sort of answer it, as well.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So it's hard to say.</p><p>CHANG: All right.</p><p>GOLDBERG: But interesting.</p><p>CHANG: Well, we're going to go on a deep dive into Bitcoin now.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST, here with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg of SurveyMonkey. we've been asking our viewers throughout the hour to respond to some surveys. We're talking about how people book their travel.</p><p>Let's look at some of the things that we found.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so, I mean, we asked people how often they use the home or apartment site to book their travel. And it was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- a home sharing site...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: Right. And it was pretty small. It was like...</p><p>CHANG: Seventy percent saying never.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Right. But about 6 percent were always or usually. So I think it's a very -- the group who does it is very passionate, but it's small.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And then I think we asked how people typically book travel. And a lot of times it's through, you know, hotel Web sites directly. It's sort of a big use case. But we got 4 percent to say vacation rental sites such as VRBO. So, you know, I think that's the main thing.</p><p>I think one of the things that came back is why would you not list your property?</p><p>And most people said not knowing the people I'd be renting to. Forty- two percent were -- that was their concern.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2014 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

So what we wanted to do was take for people the power of SurveyMonkey on the Web and give them those capabilities to create surveys, send them out and analyze the data on a mobile device.

He was CFO of Xerox, CFO of NokiaSiemens, CFO of GM Europe.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST.</p><p>I'm Emily Chang with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg, CEO of SurveyMonkey.</p><p>We're going to talk about one of our surveys that we've been running - - you guys have been running for us. It is a battle of the 5. Samsung just released its Galaxy S5 in Barcelona last week. You were at Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Apple also has the 5S, the 5C.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: There have been some doubts about how well the 5C has been doing. So we talked to customers and asked them if they really wanted to upgrade.</p><p>But first, you know, when you were at Mobile World Congress, what sort of sense did you get about the health of the smartphone market?</p><p>GOLDBERG: So...</p><p>CHANG: -- and a willingness to change?</p><p>GOLDBERG: So there were a lot of people there. It was about 80,000 people. It felt like CES with all the booths and things like that. But there was not a lot of excitement like people were talking about, oh, you've got to see this or you've got to see that.</p><p>CHANG: Right. And they unveiled the Galaxy S5. You know, there was sort of silence...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. It was...</p><p>CHANG: -- I would say.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- it was not an overwhelming wow! It was more like, oh, this is incremental and nice. And I think it's an interesting thing, because it's -- Samsung has seemed very innovative and kind of outpacing Apple, but yet Apple got sort of that same reaction to the 5S.</p><p>CHANG: Right.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And are we kind of reaching the limit for all these people?</p><p>So we got -- we ran the survey. You know, 17 percent of the people said they owned a Samsung Galaxy, which is high. Fifty-seven percent said they had no intention of upgrading.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So people are pretty happy with their 4.</p><p>CHANG: Even though this one, you can actually drop it in water?</p><p>That's what I thought was the coolest feature.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: You could drop it in water...</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean it -- there are some...</p><p>CHANG: And it will be OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: There are some cool features, but we seem to be slowing down on the features that people really want.</p><p>CHANG: Right. It's very incremental, isn't it?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Now, what -- the survey, though, the thing that did come back that people really want -- and this is hard to do and it's not something you're going to get done in a year -- people want longer battery life.</p><p>CHANG: Yes. I agree.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So we've got these big phones with great screens and they can do amazing things and then they die on you.</p><p>CHANG: If I knew I could get a phone where the battery would guarantee to last me all day long...</p><p>GOLDBERG: So that was the single biggest thing people want.</p><p>CHANG: OK, what about...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Not screen size...</p><p>CHANG: -- the iPhone?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Not anything else.</p><p>CHANG: Right, because, actually, I'm curious, when it comes to the iPhone, would people be willing to upgrade if Apple came out with a bigger screen?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I'm sure there's going to be people, but we did not see screen size as the big thing that people wanted. We saw battery life. You know, there was also not much sort of interest from Apple users in -- who don't not have a 5S buying a 5S.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And we've seen some discounting going on.</p><p>CHANG: What about the 5C?</p><p>GOLDBERG: No interest at all. Ninety-three percent said they don't own it and most of them don't have any interest.</p><p>CHANG: It's interesting, sometimes I wonder if the billboards on the 101 are a signal of what Apple is trying to push, because there are so many 5C billboards. And, you know, I wonder, is it -- is it dead in the water?</p><p>GOLDBERG: It certainly looks like it has not found its niche. I think people thought it was going to be a lot cheaper. You can see in the survey that price is something people care about. So -- but it isn't that cheap.</p><p>CHANG: They do want a smart watch, though, from Apple, don't they?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. So the data people are really excited.</p><p>CHANG: It's the product that doesn't exist yet, by the way.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. I think it's probably the most interesting, is that people are much more excited about a smart watch than they are about Google Glass. We've seen that continuously. And they want a smart watch from Apple. They believe Apple will create a great smart watch.</p><p>CHANG: All right. Well, we've got a couple more surveys coming up, one about travel.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: And Bitcoin is bouncing back, trading today at $668. This just a week after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and went offline. SurveyMonkey fielded a survey for us to get your opinion about this. The CEO of SurveyMonkey, Dave Goldberg, here with us now.</p><p>I don't understand why the price of Bitcoin is going up after the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox. But, hey, we're going to get to that in a moment.</p><p>You guys actually did a survey about Bitcoin.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: Let's walk through it.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: We've been doing it through the show and, actually...</p><p>GOLDBERG: So it was actually interesting. Like two-thirds of the people, 64 percent, have said they they've heard of Bitcoin.</p><p>CHANG: So most people know about this.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And there's been a lot of talk about it. But very few people are actually using it...</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- for anything, which make sense and...</p><p>CHANG: So have you ever bought or sold Bitcoin?</p><p>Only 11 percent said yes.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes. And...</p><p>CHANG: I have $10, by the way.</p><p>Do you have any bitcoins?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I do own Bitcoin. I'm skeptical about it as a currency for transaction, but I think it's interesting as a replacement for things like gold. So like a store of value versus a -- so everyone is excited about it being a currency for buying and selling things.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I'm less excited about that, but I think...</p><p>CHANG: More a commodity?</p><p>GOLDBERG: More like a commodity, but a, you know, a better thing to store your wealth in than gold in a place like Argentina or Iran.</p><p>CHANG: Are you nervous, though, about it getting stolen?</p><p>I mean, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin disappeared from Mt. Gox. There's no trace of it.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so I think you've got to -- I think we're going to see a change in the Bitcoin economy. A lot of stuff was getting funded. And the first thing people are going to want is security.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I want to know that this is going to be safe, that it's going to be insured. I mean, a lot of the things we have in the regular banking and regulatory system, people are going to want with Bitcoin in order for it to continue to go up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANG: All right. And by the way, guys, you can continue to answer this survey during the show.</p><p>OK, number three, have you ever encountered an establishment that uses Bitcoin or accepts Bitcoin?</p><p>Most people said no, but still 20 percent...</p><p>GOLDBERG: Twenty percent. I thought that was higher than I was...</p><p>CHANG: That's not bad.</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- than I would have guessed.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: How likely are you use it in the future?</p><p>You know, we got about 12 percent that said they were extremely very likely, which is -- that's actually pretty good, considering this is something that most people aren't using today, so...</p><p>CHANG: Not at all likely, 54 percent, though.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: OK. And then the final question, how likely is it that Bitcoin will become a widely accepted form of currency?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yeas, 16 percent said extremely or very likely. It's low, but, again, for something that very few people actually own and we had a major meltdown last week, it's not bad. But, yes, I mean, a lot of people think, you know, more than half think it's not at all likely.</p><p>CHANG: How diverse are the SurveyMonkey answers, the responses?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Well, this one is a little different. So, you know, when we did the mobile survey, that was through our SurveyMonkey audience panel.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: But this one is just -- you know, we've posted it. This is just anybody who wants to come in.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So this one isn't particularly scientific, it's more kind of fun.</p><p>CHANG: But pretty diverse, right?</p><p>GOLDBERG: But pretty diverse and we're getting, you know, we're getting people coming through BLOOMBERG WEST to sort of answer it, as well.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: So it's hard to say.</p><p>CHANG: All right.</p><p>GOLDBERG: But interesting.</p><p>CHANG: Well, we're going to go on a deep dive into Bitcoin now.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST, here with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg of SurveyMonkey. we've been asking our viewers throughout the hour to respond to some surveys. We're talking about how people book their travel.</p><p>Let's look at some of the things that we found.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes, so, I mean, we asked people how often they use the home or apartment site to book their travel. And it was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: -- a home sharing site...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG: Right. And it was pretty small. It was like...</p><p>CHANG: Seventy percent saying never.</p><p>GOLDBERG: Right. But about 6 percent were always or usually. So I think it's a very -- the group who does it is very passionate, but it's small.</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG: And then I think we asked how people typically book travel. And a lot of times it's through, you know, hotel Web sites directly. It's sort of a big use case. But we got 4 percent to say vacation rental sites such as VRBO. So, you know, I think that's the main thing.</p><p>I think one of the things that came back is why would you not list your property?</p><p>And most people said not knowing the people I'd be renting to. Forty- two percent were -- that was their concern.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBCDJ-2014030468cby70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBCDJ2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BNH-D1G1-DXH2-64SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160663</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.</copyright><publicationName>CNBC/Dow Jones Business Video</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 4, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>INTERVIEW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000CQFX</classCode><className>HOMEAWAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS561599 ALL OTHER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENT &amp; RESERVATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>AWAY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SIC:</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0008X0U</classCode><className>ECONOMIC SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DIA8</classCode><className>SHARING ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000376</classCode><className>CONSUMER ELECTRONICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFHG</classCode><className>MOBILE DEVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001881</classCode><className>WIRELESS INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CYWK</classCode><className>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CF4G</classCode><className>TABLET COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

So you guys are out with a new SurveyMonkey mobile app.   And this is the first time you've ever had an app, right?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  That's correct.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  We just launched this about a week and a half ago.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  So tell me about it.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So basically...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  I've actually got it right here.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Right.  So what we wanted to do was take for people the  power of SurveyMonkey on the Web and give them those capabilities to create  surveys, send them out and analyze the data on a mobile device.  More and  more people are living on their tablets, on their smart phones, and, you  know, we've never had a full functioned SurveyMonkey app to do the creation  and analytic side of mobile.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Now, we're going to showcase a few of the surveys on our  show...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  -- for this hour.  One of them, the Bitcoin survey, we just  put this out there an hour ago.  We already have 100 responses.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  I mean what's the kind of speed that you can get these surveys  done at?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes, I mean I think that's the point, is like you have a  quick question.  You know, you're on the go.  You know, you want to ask a  question.  We've got a six question survey.  We just pulled it together.   We Tweeted it out.  It got over 100 responses already.  And people are  going to come in and you're going to see the responses in real time.  And  we'll see them as they come in during the show.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  So we're going to do a survey on Bitcoin.  We're going to do a  survey on mobile devices, Samsung versus Apple, also, on CEO HomeAway,  Brian Sharples, is with us.  We're going to do a survey on the sharing  economy and how often people use these services.</p><p/><p>  My question is, how many businesses really need surveys on the go?</p><p/><p>  Do they really need such a fast response?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So, I think sometimes you want to create a quick survey to  go.  A lot of times, our existing users just want to check their surveys.   But I've used it quite frequently that like I put a survey out in the field  and then I'm like, oh, people aren't quite understanding this question.  I  want to change the question.</p><p/><p>  So I go in, I edit the question.  I had created it on the Web, but I  wanted to edit the question real time.  And then I'm seeing the results as  they're coming in.</p><p/><p>  So it's kind of all of those things together.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  How many surveys are you guys doing a day, about?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  We do, you know, 50,000 surveys get created a day,  something like that.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So it's large numbers of surveys being created a day.  And  we're seeing -- the app has been very popular.  We've got over 100,000  downloads in the first week.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Oh, wow!</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  And so it...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  And pretty good reviews in the app store.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  And good reviews.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  I know that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So we're excited about it.  It's still early.  We're  launching in more countries.  We are coming up with the Android version.   So there's a lot more to do in mobile.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  All right.

And so that's like the critical  thing in some place like Apple.  And then, you know, how do they think  about, in Apple's case, the problem of too much cash?</p><p/><p>  That's the question investors, I think, want to know from the CFO.   But that's not just his decision, right?</p><p/><p>  That's Tim's decision at the end of the day, too.</p><p/><p>  But that's certainly what Peter has been spending the last year-and-a- half on, wrestling with Carl Icahn and all those kind of issues.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Right.

It is a battle of the 5.  Samsung  just released its Galaxy S5 in Barcelona last week.  You were at Mobile  World Congress.</p><p/><p>  Apple also has the 5S, the 5C.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  There have been some doubts about how well the 5C has been  doing.  So we talked to customers and asked them if they really wanted to  upgrade.</p><p/><p>  But first, you know, when you were at Mobile World Congress, what sort  of sense did you get about the health of the smartphone market?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  -- and a willingness to change?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So there were a lot of people there.  It was about 80,000  people.  It felt like CES with all the booths and things like that.  But  there was not a lot of excitement like people were talking about, oh,  you've got to see this or you've got to see that.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Right.  And they unveiled the Galaxy S5.  You know, there was  sort of silence...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  It was...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  -- I would say.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  -- it was not an overwhelming wow!  It was more like, oh,  this is incremental and nice.  And I think it's an interesting thing,  because it's -- Samsung has seemed very innovative and kind of outpacing  Apple, but yet Apple got sort of that same reaction to the 5S.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Right.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  And are we kind of reaching the limit for all these people?</p><p/><p>  So we got -- we ran the survey.  You know, 17 percent of the people  said they owned a Samsung Galaxy, which is high.  Fifty-seven percent said  they had no intention of upgrading.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So people are pretty happy with their 4.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Even though this one, you can actually drop it in water?</p><p/><p>  That's what I thought was the coolest feature.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  You could drop it in water...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  I mean it -- there are some...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  And it will be OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  There are some cool features, but we seem to be slowing  down on the features that people really want.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Right.  It's very incremental, isn't it?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  Now, what -- the survey, though, the thing that did  come back that people really want -- and this is hard to do and it's not  something you're going to get done in a year -- people want longer battery  life.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Yes.  I agree.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So we've got these big phones with great screens and they  can do amazing things and then they die on you.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  If I knew I could get a phone where the battery would  guarantee to last me all day long...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So that was the single biggest thing people want.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK, what about...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Not screen size...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  -- the iPhone?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Not anything else.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Right, because, actually, I'm curious, when it comes to the  iPhone, would people be willing to upgrade if Apple came out with a bigger  screen?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  I'm sure there's going to be people, but we did not see  screen size as the big thing that people wanted.  We saw battery life.  You  know, there was also not much sort of interest from Apple users in -- who  don't not have a 5S buying a 5S.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  And we've seen some discounting going on.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  What about the 5C?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  No interest at all.  Ninety-three percent said they don't  own it and most of them don't have any interest.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  It's interesting, sometimes I wonder if the billboards on the  101 are a signal of what Apple is trying to push, because there are so many  5C billboards.  And, you know, I wonder, is it -- is it dead in the water?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  It certainly looks like it has not found its niche.  I  think people thought it was going to be a lot cheaper.  You can see in the  survey that price is something people care about.  So -- but it isn't that  cheap.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  They do want a smart watch, though, from Apple, don't they?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  So the data people are really excited.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  It's the product that doesn't exist yet, by the way.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  Yes.  I think it's probably the most interesting, is  that people are much more excited about a smart watch than they are about  Google Glass.  We've seen that continuously.  And they want a smart watch  from Apple.  They believe Apple will create a great smart watch.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  All right.  Well, we've got a couple more surveys coming up,  one about travel.</p><p/><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  And Bitcoin is bouncing back, trading today at $668.  This  just a week after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and went offline.   SurveyMonkey fielded a survey for us to get your opinion about this.  The  CEO of SurveyMonkey, Dave Goldberg, here with us now.</p><p/><p>  I don't understand why the price of Bitcoin is going up after the  bankruptcy of Mt. Gox.  But, hey, we're going to get to that in a moment.</p><p/><p>  You guys actually did a survey about Bitcoin.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Let's walk through it.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  We've been doing it through the show and, actually...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So it was actually interesting.  Like two-thirds of the  people, 64 percent, have said they they've heard of Bitcoin.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  So most people know about this.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  And there's been a lot of talk about it.  But very  few people are actually using it...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  -- for anything, which make sense and...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  So have you ever bought or sold Bitcoin?</p><p/><p>  Only 11 percent said yes.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.  And...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  I have $10, by the way.</p><p/><p>  Do you have any bitcoins?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  I do own Bitcoin.  I'm skeptical about it as a currency for  transaction, but I think it's interesting as a replacement for things like  gold.  So like a store of value versus a -- so everyone is excited about it  being a currency for buying and selling things.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  I'm less excited about that, but I think...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  More a commodity?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  More like a commodity, but a, you know, a better thing to  store your wealth in than gold in a place like Argentina or Iran.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Are you nervous, though, about it getting stolen?</p><p/><p>  I mean, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin disappeared  from Mt. Gox.  There's no trace of it.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes, so I think you've got to -- I think we're going to see  a change in the Bitcoin economy.  A lot of stuff was getting funded.  And  the first thing people are going to want is security.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  I want to know that this is going to be safe, that it's  going to be insured.  I mean, a lot of the things we have in the regular  banking and regulatory system, people are going to want with Bitcoin in  order for it to continue to go up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  All right.  And by the way, guys, you can continue to answer  this survey during the show.</p><p/><p>  OK, number three, have you ever encountered an establishment that uses  Bitcoin or accepts Bitcoin?</p><p/><p>  Most people said no, but still 20 percent...</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Twenty percent.  I thought that was higher than I was...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  That's not bad.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  -- than I would have guessed.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  How likely are you use it in the future?</p><p/><p>  You know, we got about 12 percent that said they were extremely very  likely, which is -- that's actually pretty good, considering this is  something that most people aren't using today, so...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Not at all likely, 54 percent, though.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.  And then the final question, how likely is it that  Bitcoin will become a widely accepted form of currency?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yeas, 16 percent said extremely or very likely.  It's low,  but, again, for something that very few people actually own and we had a  major meltdown last week, it's not bad.  But, yes, I mean, a lot of people  think, you know, more than half think it's not at all likely.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  How diverse are the SurveyMonkey answers, the responses?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Well, this one is a little different.  So, you know, when  we did the mobile survey, that was through our SurveyMonkey audience panel.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  But this one is just -- you know, we've posted it.  This is  just anybody who wants to come in.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So this one isn't particularly scientific, it's more kind  of fun.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  But pretty diverse, right?</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  But pretty diverse and we're getting, you know, we're  getting people coming through BLOOMBERG WEST to sort of answer it, as well.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  So it's hard to say.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  All right.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  But interesting.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Well, we're going to go on a deep dive into Bitcoin now.</p><p/><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST, here with our special guest  host, Dave Goldberg of SurveyMonkey.   we've been asking our viewers throughout the hour to respond to some  surveys.  We're talking about how people book their travel.</p><p/><p>  Let's look at some of the things that we found.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes, so, I mean, we asked people how often they use the  home or apartment site to book their travel.  And it was...</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  -- a home sharing site...</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p/><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Right.  And it was pretty small.  It was like...</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  Seventy percent saying never.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  Right.  But about 6 percent were always or usually.  So I  think it's a very -- the group who does it is very passionate, but it's  small.</p><p/><p>  CHANG:  OK.</p><p/><p>  GOLDBERG:  And then I think we asked how people typically book travel.   And a lot of times it's through, you know, hotel Web sites directly.  It's  sort of a big use case.  But we got 4 percent to say vacation rental sites  such as VRBO.  So, you know, I think that's the main thing.</p><p/><p>  I think one of the things that came back is why would you not list  your property?</p><p/><p>  And most people said not knowing the people I'd be renting to.  Forty- two percent were -- that was their concern.</p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2014 CNBC/Dow Jones Business  Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

So you guys are out with a new SurveyMonkey mobile app.   And this is the first time you've ever had an app, right?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  That's correct.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  We just launched this about a week and a half ago.</p><p>CHANG:  So tell me about it.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So basically...</p><p>CHANG:  I've actually got it right here.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Right.  So what we wanted to do was take for people the  power of SurveyMonkey on the Web and give them those capabilities to create  surveys, send them out and analyze the data on a mobile device.  More and  more people are living on their tablets, on their smart phones, and, you  know, we've never had a full functioned SurveyMonkey app to do the creation  and analytic side of mobile.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, we're going to showcase a few of the surveys on our  show...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  -- for this hour.  One of them, the Bitcoin survey, we just  put this out there an hour ago.  We already have 100 responses.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  I mean what's the kind of speed that you can get these surveys  done at?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes, I mean I think that's the point, is like you have a  quick question.  You know, you're on the go.  You know, you want to ask a  question.  We've got a six question survey.  We just pulled it together.   We Tweeted it out.  It got over 100 responses already.  And people are  going to come in and you're going to see the responses in real time.  And  we'll see them as they come in during the show.</p><p>CHANG:  So we're going to do a survey on Bitcoin.  We're going to do a  survey on mobile devices, Samsung versus Apple, also, on CEO HomeAway,  Brian Sharples, is with us.  We're going to do a survey on the sharing  economy and how often people use these services.</p><p>My question is, how many businesses really need surveys on the go?</p><p>Do they really need such a fast response?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So, I think sometimes you want to create a quick survey to  go.  A lot of times, our existing users just want to check their surveys.   But I've used it quite frequently that like I put a survey out in the field  and then I'm like, oh, people aren't quite understanding this question.  I  want to change the question.</p><p>So I go in, I edit the question.  I had created it on the Web, but I  wanted to edit the question real time.  And then I'm seeing the results as  they're coming in.</p><p>So it's kind of all of those things together.</p><p>CHANG:  How many surveys are you guys doing a day, about?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  We do, you know, 50,000 surveys get created a day,  something like that.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So it's large numbers of surveys being created a day.  And  we're seeing -- the app has been very popular.  We've got over 100,000  downloads in the first week.</p><p>CHANG:  Oh, wow!</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And so it...</p><p>CHANG:  And pretty good reviews in the app store.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And good reviews.</p><p>CHANG:  I know that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So we're excited about it.  It's still early.  We're  launching in more countries.  We are coming up with the Android version.   So there's a lot more to do in mobile.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Well, all of the surveys, all three of those  surveys I mentioned, we've Tweeted those out from our @BloombergWest  account.  You can answer them there.  And we will get to them later in the  show.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG:  I mean, Dave, you run a big tech company.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  What do you look for in a CFO?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I mean I think you want someone, in a public company in  particular, that investors will trust, that -- I mean the CFO is the  trustee, in essence, of the financials.  And so that's like the critical  thing in some place like Apple.  And then, you know, how do they think  about, in Apple's case, the problem of too much cash?</p><p>That's the question investors, I think, want to know from the CFO.   But that's not just his decision, right?</p><p>That's Tim's decision at the end of the day, too.</p><p>But that's certainly what Peter has been spending the last year-and-a- half on, wrestling with Carl Icahn and all those kind of issues.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  He does have quite an extensive resume.  He was CFO of  Xerox, CFO of NokiaSiemens, CFO of GM Europe.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG:  Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST.</p><p>I'm Emily Chang with our special guest host, Dave Goldberg, CEO of  SurveyMonkey.</p><p>We're going to talk about one of our surveys that we've been running - - you guys have been running for us.  It is a battle of the 5.  Samsung  just released its Galaxy S5 in Barcelona last week.  You were at Mobile  World Congress.</p><p>Apple also has the 5S, the 5C.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  There have been some doubts about how well the 5C has been  doing.  So we talked to customers and asked them if they really wanted to  upgrade.</p><p>But first, you know, when you were at Mobile World Congress, what sort  of sense did you get about the health of the smartphone market?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So...</p><p>CHANG:  -- and a willingness to change?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So there were a lot of people there.  It was about 80,000  people.  It felt like CES with all the booths and things like that.  But  there was not a lot of excitement like people were talking about, oh,  you've got to see this or you've got to see that.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  And they unveiled the Galaxy S5.  You know, there was  sort of silence...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  It was...</p><p>CHANG:  -- I would say.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  -- it was not an overwhelming wow!  It was more like, oh,  this is incremental and nice.  And I think it's an interesting thing,  because it's -- Samsung has seemed very innovative and kind of outpacing  Apple, but yet Apple got sort of that same reaction to the 5S.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And are we kind of reaching the limit for all these people?</p><p>So we got -- we ran the survey.  You know, 17 percent of the people  said they owned a Samsung Galaxy, which is high.  Fifty-seven percent said  they had no intention of upgrading.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So people are pretty happy with their 4.</p><p>CHANG:  Even though this one, you can actually drop it in water?</p><p>That's what I thought was the coolest feature.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  You could drop it in water...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I mean it -- there are some...</p><p>CHANG:  And it will be OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  There are some cool features, but we seem to be slowing  down on the features that people really want.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.  It's very incremental, isn't it?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  Now, what -- the survey, though, the thing that did  come back that people really want -- and this is hard to do and it's not  something you're going to get done in a year -- people want longer battery  life.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  I agree.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So we've got these big phones with great screens and they  can do amazing things and then they die on you.</p><p>CHANG:  If I knew I could get a phone where the battery would  guarantee to last me all day long...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So that was the single biggest thing people want.</p><p>CHANG:  OK, what about...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Not screen size...</p><p>CHANG:  -- the iPhone?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Not anything else.</p><p>CHANG:  Right, because, actually, I'm curious, when it comes to the  iPhone, would people be willing to upgrade if Apple came out with a bigger  screen?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I'm sure there's going to be people, but we did not see  screen size as the big thing that people wanted.  We saw battery life.  You  know, there was also not much sort of interest from Apple users in -- who  don't not have a 5S buying a 5S.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And we've seen some discounting going on.</p><p>CHANG:  What about the 5C?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  No interest at all.  Ninety-three percent said they don't  own it and most of them don't have any interest.</p><p>CHANG:  It's interesting, sometimes I wonder if the billboards on the  101 are a signal of what Apple is trying to push, because there are so many  5C billboards.  And, you know, I wonder, is it -- is it dead in the water?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  It certainly looks like it has not found its niche.  I  think people thought it was going to be a lot cheaper.  You can see in the  survey that price is something people care about.  So -- but it isn't that  cheap.</p><p>CHANG:  They do want a smart watch, though, from Apple, don't they?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  So the data people are really excited.</p><p>CHANG:  It's the product that doesn't exist yet, by the way.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  Yes.  I think it's probably the most interesting, is  that people are much more excited about a smart watch than they are about  Google Glass.  We've seen that continuously.  And they want a smart watch  from Apple.  They believe Apple will create a great smart watch.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Well, we've got a couple more surveys coming up,  one about travel.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG:  And Bitcoin is bouncing back, trading today at $668.  This  just a week after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and went offline.   SurveyMonkey fielded a survey for us to get your opinion about this.  The  CEO of SurveyMonkey, Dave Goldberg, here with us now.</p><p>I don't understand why the price of Bitcoin is going up after the  bankruptcy of Mt. Gox.  But, hey, we're going to get to that in a moment.</p><p>You guys actually did a survey about Bitcoin.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  Let's walk through it.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  We've been doing it through the show and, actually...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So it was actually interesting.  Like two-thirds of the  people, 64 percent, have said they they've heard of Bitcoin.</p><p>CHANG:  So most people know about this.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  And there's been a lot of talk about it.  But very  few people are actually using it...</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  -- for anything, which make sense and...</p><p>CHANG:  So have you ever bought or sold Bitcoin?</p><p>Only 11 percent said yes.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.  And...</p><p>CHANG:  I have $10, by the way.</p><p>Do you have any bitcoins?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I do own Bitcoin.  I'm skeptical about it as a currency for  transaction, but I think it's interesting as a replacement for things like  gold.  So like a store of value versus a -- so everyone is excited about it  being a currency for buying and selling things.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I'm less excited about that, but I think...</p><p>CHANG:  More a commodity?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  More like a commodity, but a, you know, a better thing to  store your wealth in than gold in a place like Argentina or Iran.</p><p>CHANG:  Are you nervous, though, about it getting stolen?</p><p>I mean, what, hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin disappeared  from Mt. Gox.  There's no trace of it.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes, so I think you've got to -- I think we're going to see  a change in the Bitcoin economy.  A lot of stuff was getting funded.  And  the first thing people are going to want is security.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I want to know that this is going to be safe, that it's  going to be insured.  I mean, a lot of the things we have in the regular  banking and regulatory system, people are going to want with Bitcoin in  order for it to continue to go up (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  And by the way, guys, you can continue to answer  this survey during the show.</p><p>OK, number three, have you ever encountered an establishment that uses  Bitcoin or accepts Bitcoin?</p><p>Most people said no, but still 20 percent...</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Twenty percent.  I thought that was higher than I was...</p><p>CHANG:  That's not bad.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  -- than I would have guessed.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  How likely are you use it in the future?</p><p>You know, we got about 12 percent that said they were extremely very  likely, which is -- that's actually pretty good, considering this is  something that most people aren't using today, so...</p><p>CHANG:  Not at all likely, 54 percent, though.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.  And then the final question, how likely is it that  Bitcoin will become a widely accepted form of currency?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yeas, 16 percent said extremely or very likely.  It's low,  but, again, for something that very few people actually own and we had a  major meltdown last week, it's not bad.  But, yes, I mean, a lot of people  think, you know, more than half think it's not at all likely.</p><p>CHANG:  How diverse are the SurveyMonkey answers, the responses?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Well, this one is a little different.  So, you know, when  we did the mobile survey, that was through our SurveyMonkey audience panel.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  But this one is just -- you know, we've posted it.  This is  just anybody who wants to come in.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So this one isn't particularly scientific, it's more kind  of fun.</p><p>CHANG:  But pretty diverse, right?</p><p>GOLDBERG:  But pretty diverse and we're getting, you know, we're  getting people coming through BLOOMBERG WEST to sort of answer it, as well.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  So it's hard to say.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  But interesting.</p><p>CHANG:  Well, we're going to go on a deep dive into Bitcoin now.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHANG:  Welcome back to BLOOMBERG WEST, here with our special guest  host, Dave Goldberg of SurveyMonkey.   we've been asking our viewers throughout the hour to respond to some  surveys.  We're talking about how people book their travel.</p><p>Let's look at some of the things that we found.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes, so, I mean, we asked people how often they use the  home or apartment site to book their travel.  And it was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  -- a home sharing site...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Right.  And it was pretty small.  It was like...</p><p>CHANG:  Seventy percent saying never.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  Right.  But about 6 percent were always or usually.  So I  think it's a very -- the group who does it is very passionate, but it's  small.</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And then I think we asked how people typically book travel.   And a lot of times it's through, you know, hotel Web sites directly.  It's  sort of a big use case.  But we got 4 percent to say vacation rental sites  such as VRBO.  So, you know, I think that's the main thing.</p><p>I think one of the things that came back is why would you not list  your property?</p><p>And most people said not knowing the people I'd be renting to.  Forty- two percent were -- that was their concern.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2014 CNBC/Dow Jones Business  Video, a division of CNBC/Dow Jones Desktop Video, LLC.

But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.</p><p>The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom \\x97 including Rhode Island\u2019s own Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the House Judiciary\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust \\x97 were sitting, in masks, in the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data</p><p>from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private-label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin \\x97 in the home districts of Cicilline and the subcommittee\u2019s ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the antitrust subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p>Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \"these giants stand to profit\" and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>WASHINGTON \\x97 Fending off accusations that their companies stifle competition, four Big Tech CEOs \\x97 Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \\x97 answered for their companies' practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers on Wednesday.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRVJNL-34775388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRVJNL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-X2J1-DY30-100X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146817</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"904\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Providence Publications, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Providence Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We have seen some major moves with getting folks like Parks in charge who started Athena Health.\u00a0 Even the CIOs are not exactly sure if they can keep up in the time elements established to be current with new laws and rules.\u00a0 I have had a few occasions to chat with some CIOs and folks in positions responsible for big tech decisions and even the ones who are hands on and write code get stressed as the expectations seem to be very high today and yet the average layman has no clue of all the data work and coding that goes along with all of the work with medical records.\u00a0 Its a lot and the technology is not cheap and does not grow on trees as far as cost.\u00a0 If it were not for the stimulus funds I think the would not see the uptick with the adoption of electronic records.\u00a0<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ducknetweb.blogspot.com/2010/12/cio-confidence-in-meaningful-use-drops.html\">CIO Confidence In Meaningful Use Drops-The New Left Curve of Technology That Arrives Daily Contributes-Dont Burn These Folks Out</url><br/><br/>The pressure is certainly on to take technology and create better care and save money and you would have to be living under a stone to not hear the money side today.\u00a0 Below you can see where one company is offering a bounty for some algorithms and with this increased pressure on analytics, we need more Algo Men all over the place.\u00a0 How do you provide good care and not get side swiped with analytics and become less than human at times.\u00a0 Thats a big challenge.</p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://ducknetweb.blogspot.com/2011/02/heritage-providers-continues-to-promote.html\">Heritage Providers Continues to Promote $3 Million Dollar Prize to Create An Algorithm To Predict and Prevents Hospitalizations</url><br/>It will be interesting to see who comes in next.\u00a0 I would like to see someone like Dr. Halamka from Harvard step in, that is if he wants the responsibility, but he certainly has the ability and then some.\u00a0 BD\u00a0 <br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/community/healthit_hhs_gov__home/1204\">National Coordinator for Health Information Technology</url> David Blumenthal, M.D., will step down from his post this spring.

For example, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.govinfosecurity.com/regulations.php?reg_id=2127\">HITECH EHR incentive program</url> requires hospitals and physicians to conduct a risk assessment and mitigate any risks identified.

A practicing physician, he also served as the Samuel O. Their Professor of Medicine and Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School. He also served as director of the Harvard University Interfaculty Program for Health Systems Improvement.<br/><br/>Previously, he was senior vice president at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and served as executive director of the Center for Health Policy and Management and as a lecturer on public policy at the John F.

That refusal prompted this reaction, the reporters noted: \u201cHis longtime P.R. adviser, Dawn Schneider, who had been pushing for a more forceful denunciation, dropped her pen, threw up her arms and buried her head in her hands.\u201d</p><p>Bottom line: This is the latest embarrassing episode for Mr. Boies, who was previously perhaps best known for prosecuting a landmark antitrust case against Microsoft and for obtaining the right for gays and lesbians to get married in California.

Last thinks President Donald Trump is here forever. Last, the editor of The Bulwark, a conservative site that\u2019s been hostile to Trump, argues that if Trump loses in November, he\u2019ll claim he was cheated out of the election. He\u2019ll force other Republicans to back up his claim. He\u2019ll get a TV show, hold rallies, be coy about running again in 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He\u2019ll still be the center of everything Republican. Ambitious Republicans will have to lash themselves to the husk of the dying czar if they want to have any future in the party. The whole party will go Trump-crazed and brain dead for another four years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I salute Last for coming up with a post-2020 scenario even more pessimistic than my own!</p><p>My guess is that if Trump gets crushed in the election, millions of Republicans will decide they never liked that loser and jerk anyway. He\u2019ll get relegated to whatever bargain basement they are using to hold Sarah Palin. But something will remain Trumpism.</p><p>The basic Trump worldview \u2014 on immigration, trade, foreign policy, etc. \u2014 will shape the GOP for decades, the way the basic Reagan worldview did for decades. A thousand smarter conservatives will be building a new party after 2020, but one that builds from the framework Trump established.</p><p>I think Trumpism will survive Trump because the history of the modern Republican Party is the history of paradigm shifts.</p><p>If you came of age with conservative values and around Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s, you lived within a certain Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher paradigm. It was about limiting government, spreading democracy abroad, building dynamic free markets at home and cultivating people with vigorous virtues \u2014 people who are energetic, upright, entrepreneurial, independent-minded, loyal to friends and strong against foes.</p><p>For decades conservatives were happy to live in that paradigm. But as years went by many came to see its limits. It was so comprehensively anti-government that it had no way to use government to solve common problems. It was so focused on cultivating strong individuals that it had no language to cultivate a sense of community and belonging. So, if you were right of center, you leapt. You broke from the Reagan paradigm and tried to create a new, updated conservative paradigm.</p><p>My own leap came early. On Sept. 15, 1997, William Kristol and I wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal on what we called National Greatness Conservatism. We argued that the GOP had become too anti-government. \u201cHow can Americans love their nation if they hate its government?\u201d we asked. Only a return to the robust American nationalism of Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay and Theodore Roosevelt would do ambitious national projects, infrastructure, federal programs to increase social mobility.</p><p>The closest National Greatness Conservatism came to influencing the party was John McCain\u2019s 2000 presidential bid. He was defeated by a man, George W. Bush, who made his own leap, to Compassionate Conservatism. (You know somebody has made a paradigm leap when he or she starts adding some modifying word or phrase before \u201cConservatism.\u201d) This was an attempt to meld Catholic social teaching to conservatism.</p><p>There were many other leaps over the decades. Sam\u2019s Club Republicans, led by Reihan Salam and my Times colleague Ross Douthat, pointed a way to link the GOP to working-class concerns. Front Porch Republicans celebrated small towns and local communities. The Reformicons tried to use government to build strong families and neighborhoods. The Niskanen Center is an entire think tank for people who have leapt from libertarianism.</p><p>Most actual Republican politicians rejected all of this. They stuck, mostly through dumb inertia, to an anti-government zombie Reaganism long after Reagan was dead and even though the nation\u2019s problems were utterly different from what they were when he was alive. Year after year, GOP politicians clung to a dead paradigm, ran the same anti-Washington campaigns and had no positive governing philosophy once they got there.</p><p>Steve Bannon\u2019s leap finally did what none of us could do. Donald Trump and Bannon took a low-rent strand of conservatism \u2014 class-based ethnic nationalism \u2014 that had always been locked away in the basement of the American right, and overturned the Reagan paradigm.</p><p>Bannon and Trump got the emotions right. They understood that Republican voters were no longer motivated by a sense of hope and opportunity; they were motivated by a sense of menace, resentment and fear. At base, many Republicans felt they were being purged from their own country \u2014 by the educated elite, by multiculturalism, by militant secularism.</p><p>During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Bannon discarded the Republican orthodoxy \u2014 entitlement reform, fiscal restraint, free trade, comprehensive immigration reform. They embraced a European-style blood-and-soil conservatism. Close off immigration. Close trade. We have nothing to offer the world and should protect ourselves from its dangers.</p><p>It would have been interesting if Trump had governed as a big-government populist. But he tossed Bannon out and handed power to Jared Kushner and a bunch of old men locked in the Reagan paradigm. We got bigotry, incompetence and tax cuts for the wealthy.</p><p>But by defeating the Reagan paradigm, Trump and Bannon gave permission to a lot of Republican politicians to make their own leaps. Over the last three years, it\u2019s been interesting to watch a series of Republican officeholders break free from old orthodoxies and begin to think afresh. You could see their eyes get wider Suddenly I can think for myself. The range of possibilities is wider than I thought it was.</p><p>Their newfound liberation didn\u2019t extend to crossing Trump, but because the president\u2019s political vision isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call fleshed out, there\u2019s a lot of running room within his paradigm.</p><p>The post-2020, post-Trump Republican future is contained in those leaps. And that future is embodied by a small group of Republican senators in their 40s, including Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Ben Sasse. They all came of age when Reaganism was already in the rearview mirror. Though populist, three of them have advanced degrees from Harvard or Yale. They are not particularly close to one another. They may be joined by a common experience, but they are divided by ambition.</p><p>Each has a different vision of where the country should go, but they start with certain common Trumpian premises</p><p>Everything is not OK. The free market is not working well. Wages are stagnant. Too much power is in the hands of the corporate elites. Middle America is getting screwed. Finance capitalism is unbalanced. American society is in abject decline. If Reaganism was \u201cLet\u2019s be free,\u201d the new mood is \u201cTake control.\u201d</p><p>Economic libertarianism is not the answer. Free markets alone won\u2019t solve our problems. GDP growth alone is not the be-all and end-all of politics. We need policies to shore up the conservative units of society \u2014 family, neighborhood, faith, nation. We need policies that build solidarity, not just liberty.</p><p>The working class is the heart of the Republican Party. Once, businesspeople and entrepreneurs were at the center of the Republican imagination. Now it\u2019s clear that the party needs to stop catering to the corporate class and start focusing on the shop owners, the plumbers, the salaried workers. It needs to emphasize the dignity of work and honor those who are not trying to make millions, not looking for handouts, but just want to build middle-class lives in a stable social order. In Britain, the Conservative Party has built a majority around the working class, and that\u2019s what Republicans need to do here.</p><p>China changes everything. The rise of a 1.4-billion-person authoritarian superpower means that free trade no longer works because the Chinese are not playing by the same rules. The U.S. government cannot just stand back and let China control the new technologies. \u201cRepublicans are going to have to get used to the idea of industrial policy to counter China, at least in a few key industries,\u201d Mike Gallagher, a rising star among House Republicans, told me.</p><p>The managerial class betrays America. Many of the post-Reagan positions seem like steps to the left. But these Republicans combine a greater willingness to use government with a greater hostility to the managerial class. The solution to too much corporate power is not handing power to Elizabeth Warren and a cloud of federal regulators. There\u2019s a difference between empowering workers and empowering the Washington elite.</p><p>From these common premises the four senators go off in different directions.</p><p>Rubio bases his vision in Catholic social teaching. A year ago, he wrote an essay for First Things titled, \u201cWhat Economics Is For,\u201d arguing that the purpose of markets is not growth but allowing each person to find dignity in work. He followed that up with a speech at Catholic University calling for \u201ccommon-good capitalism\u201d (remember what I said about modifying phrases) in which he criticized contemporary capitalism for its obsessive focus on maximizing shareholder value.</p><p>His basic position is that American capitalism has become too much about finance. It needs to be balanced toward manufacturing. He, too, supports a \u201cpro-American industrial policy\u201d to meet the Chinese challenge.</p><p>Hawley is the most populist of the group. His core belief is that middle-class Americans have been betrayed by elites on every level \u2014 political elites, cultural elites, financial elites. The modern leadership class has one set of values \u2014 globalization, cosmopolitanism \u2014 and the Middle Americans have another set \u2014 family, home, rootedness, nation. Corporate elites have concentrated so much power that they now crush the yeomen masses.</p><p>Last November, Hawley gave a speech in which he sought to overturn the last 70 years of Republican foreign policy. He contended that the right had erred in trying to spread American values abroad. \u201cImperial domination violates our principles and it threatens our character. Our aim must be to prevent imperialism, not to exercise it; to stop domination, not foster it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cotton has a less developed political vision but a more developed attitude hawkishness. Whether it\u2019s China, the left, immigration or Big Tech, Cotton is hawkish. He sees a world threatened by disorder and gravitates toward the toughest positions in order to ward off threat. He is the most vocal foe of the Chinese \u201cpariah state.\u201d He wants sharp reductions in legal immigration.</p><p>Sasse is the most sociological of the crew. He is a Tocquevillian localist, who notes that most normal Americans go days without thinking of national politics. His vision is centered on the small associations \u2014 neighborhood groups, high school football teams, churches and community centers \u2014 where people find their greatest joys, satisfactions and supports. Government\u2019s job, he says, is to \u201ccreate a framework of ordered liberty\u201d so that people can make their family and neighborhood the center of their lives.</p><p>He is the most suspicious of government and politics today. \u201cI think politicians are arsonists,\u201d he told me over the phone last month. \u201cThe main thing the GOP does is try to light the Democrats on fire, and the main thing the Democrats do is light the Republicans on fire. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so little trust in politics.\u201d</p><p>Behind these public figures there is a posse of policy wonks and commentators supporting a new Working-Class Republicanism, including Oren Cass, Henry Olsen, J.D. Vance, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Saagar Enjeti, Samuel Hammond and, in his own way, Tucker Carlson.</p><p>Cass, for example, has created a new think tank, the American Compass, to push the GOP in a post-Trump direction. Cass, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, argues that free-market economists pay too much attention to GDP growth. What matters is the kind of growth and whether it allows people to lead stable lives. He says there\u2019s too much emphasis on consumption. People should be seen as producers, and government should create the kind of jobs that allow people to earn dignity through work.</p><p>He says the core of the economy is the industrial economy manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure \u2014 making things in the physical world. \u201cInvestment in our economy has completely discounted the making of stuff,\u201d he told me in a recent interview. \u201cYou have a VC industry that goes entirely to software. Private equity financial flow is about buying and trading companies.\u201d Government needs to engage in \u201cpredistribution,\u201d to steer investment to manufacturing, and also to those middle American parts of the country that are currently left out.</p><p>\u201cThe American labor force cannot be changed into what the economy wants,\u201d Cass says. \u201cWe have to change the economy to what the American labor force can be successful in.\u201d</p><p>The intellectual future of conservatism will be wrestled over at a series of forums at the Center for Social, Cultural and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute that are being organized by Yuval Levin, a scholar there. Right now, the various factions are exchanging sarcastic one-liners on Twitter. Levin is bringing the players together. \u201cPeople should be talking to each other, not about each other,\u201d he told me.</p><p>Levin thinks the prevailing post-Trump viewpoints define the problem too much in economic terms. The crucial problem, he argues, is not economic; it\u2019s social alienation. Millions of Americans don\u2019t feel part of anything they can trust. They feel no one is looking out for them. Trump was a false answer to their desire for social solidarity, but the desire can be a force for good.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s needed,\u201d Levin says, \u201cis not just to expand economic conservatism beyond growth to also prioritize family, community and nation, but also to expand social conservatism beyond sexual ethics and religious liberty to prioritize family, community and nation. The coalition can be a powerful political force again if its different wings converge on these priorities, without each giving up on its long-standing aims.\u201d</p><p>The Republican Party looks completely brain dead at every spot Trump directly reaches. Off in the corners, though, there\u2019s a lot of intellectual ferment on the right. But if there is one thing I\u2019ve learned over the decades, it is never to underestimate the staying power of the dead Reagan paradigm.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page stands as a vigilant guardian of the corpse, eager to rebut all dissenters. Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are staunch defenders of Minimal-Government Conservatism. Sen. Ted Cruz seems to be positioning himself for a 2024 presidential run that seeks to triangulate all the pre-Trump and pro-Trump versions of the party into one stew.</p><p>And if Joe Biden defeats Trump and begins legislating, as seems more and more likely, there\u2019s also the possibility that Republicans will abandon any positive vision and revert to being a simple anti-government party \u2014 a party of opposition to whatever Biden is doing.</p><p>But over the long term, some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the GOP. In the first place, that\u2019s where Republican voters are. When push comes to shove, Republican politicians are going to choose their voters over their donor class.</p><p>Second, the working-class emphasis is the only way out of the demographic doom loop. If the party sticks with its old white high school-educated base, it will die. They just aren\u2019t making enough old white men. To have any shot of surviving as a major party, the GOP has to build a cross-racial alliance among working-class whites, working-class Hispanics and some working-class Blacks.</p><p>None of this works unless Republicans can deracialize their appeal \u2014 by which I mean they must stop pandering to the racists in the party and stop presenting themselves and seeing themselves as the party of white people \u2014 and wage a class struggle between diverse workers in their coalition and the highly educated coastal manager and professional class in the Democratic coalition.</p><p>Rubio, Hawley, Sasse and Cotton are inching toward a GOP future. What are the odds they\u2019ll succeed? They\u2019ve got to be way under 50-50.</p><p>David Brooks is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomopinioncommentary20200811davidbrookswheredo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JW-NJ01-DYT5-M0MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Last, the editor of The Bulwark , a conservative site that\u2019s been hostile to Trump, argues that if Trump loses in November, he\u2019ll claim he was cheated out of the election. He\u2019ll force other Republicans to back up his claim. He\u2019ll get a TV show, hold rallies, be coy about running again in 2024.      He\u2019ll still be the center of everything Republican. Ambitious Republicans will have to lash themselves to the husk of the dying czar if they want to have any future in the party. The whole party will go Trump-crazed and brain dead for another four years.      I salute Last for coming up with a post-2020 scenario even more pessimistic than my own!      My guess is that if Trump gets crushed in the election, millions of Republicans will decide they never liked that loser and jerk anyway. He\u2019ll get relegated to whatever bargain basement they are using to hold Sarah Palin. But something will remain: Trumpism.      The basic Trump worldview \u2014 on immigration, trade, foreign policy, etc. \u2014 will shape the GOP for decades, the way the basic Reagan worldview did for decades. A thousand smarter conservatives will be building a new party after 2020, but one that builds from the framework Trump established.      I think Trumpism will survive Trump because the history of the modern Republican Party is the history of paradigm shifts.      If you came of age with conservative values and around Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s, you lived within a certain Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher paradigm. It was about limiting government, spreading democracy abroad, building dynamic free markets at home and cultivating people with vigorous virtues \u2014 people who are energetic, upright, entrepreneurial, independent-minded, loyal to friends and strong against foes.      For decades conservatives were happy to live in that paradigm. But as years went by many came to see its limits. It was so comprehensively anti-government that it had no way to use government to solve common problems. It was so focused on cultivating strong individuals that it had no language to cultivate a sense of community and belonging. So, if you were right of center, you leapt. You broke from the Reagan paradigm and tried to create a new, updated conservative paradigm.      My own leap came early. On Sept. 15, 1997, William Kristol and I wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal on what we called National Greatness Conservatism. We argued that the GOP had become too anti-government. \u201cHow can Americans love their nation if they hate its government?\u201d we asked. Only a return to the robust American nationalism of Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay and Theodore Roosevelt would do: ambitious national projects, infrastructure, federal programs to increase social mobility.      The closest National Greatness Conservatism came to influencing the party was John McCain\u2019s 2000 presidential bid. He was defeated by a man, George W. Bush, who made his own leap, to Compassionate Conservatism. (You know somebody has made a paradigm leap when he or she starts adding some modifying word or phrase before \u201cConservatism.\u201d) This was an attempt to meld Catholic social teaching to conservatism.      There were many other leaps over the decades. Sam\u2019s Club Republicans, led by Reihan Salam and my Times colleague Ross Douthat, pointed a way to link the GOP to working-class concerns. Front Porch Republicans celebrated small towns and local communities. The Reformicons tried to use government to build strong families and neighborhoods. The Niskanen Center is an entire think tank for people who have leapt from libertarianism.      Most actual Republican politicians rejected all of this. They stuck, mostly through dumb inertia, to an anti-government zombie Reaganism long after Reagan was dead and even though the nation\u2019s problems were utterly different from what they were when he was alive. Year after year, GOP politicians clung to a dead paradigm, ran the same anti-Washington campaigns and had no positive governing philosophy once they got there.      Steve Bannon\u2019s leap finally did what none of us could do. Donald Trump and Bannon took a low-rent strand of conservatism \u2014 class-based ethnic nationalism \u2014 that had always been locked away in the basement of the American right, and overturned the Reagan paradigm.      Bannon and Trump got the emotions right. They understood that Republican voters were no longer motivated by a sense of hope and opportunity; they were motivated by a sense of menace, resentment and fear. At base, many Republicans felt they were being purged from their own country \u2014 by the educated elite, by multiculturalism, by militant secularism.      During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Bannon discarded the Republican orthodoxy \u2014 entitlement reform, fiscal restraint, free trade, comprehensive immigration reform. They embraced a European-style blood-and-soil conservatism. Close off immigration. Close trade. We have nothing to offer the world and should protect ourselves from its dangers.      It would have been interesting if Trump had governed as a big-government populist. But he tossed Bannon out and handed power to Jared Kushner and a bunch of old men locked in the Reagan paradigm. We got bigotry, incompetence and tax cuts for the wealthy.      But by defeating the Reagan paradigm, Trump and Bannon gave permission to a lot of Republican politicians to make their own leaps. Over the last three years, it\u2019s been interesting to watch a series of Republican officeholders break free from old orthodoxies and begin to think afresh. You could see their eyes get wider: Suddenly I can think for myself. The range of possibilities is wider than I thought it was.      Their newfound liberation didn\u2019t extend to crossing Trump, but because the president\u2019s political vision isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call fleshed out, there\u2019s a lot of running room within his paradigm.      The post-2020, post-Trump Republican future is contained in those leaps. And that future is embodied by a small group of Republican senators in their 40s, including Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Ben Sasse. They all came of age when Reaganism was already in the rearview mirror. Though populist, three of them have advanced degrees from Harvard or Yale. They are not particularly close to one another. They may be joined by a common experience, but they are divided by ambition.      Each has a different vision of where the country should go, but they start with certain common Trumpian premises:       Everything is not OK. The free market is not working well. Wages are stagnant. Too much power is in the hands of the corporate elites. Middle America is getting screwed. Finance capitalism is unbalanced. American society is in abject decline. If Reaganism was \u201cLet\u2019s be free,\u201d the new mood is \u201cTake control.\u201d       Economic libertarianism is not the answer. Free markets alone won\u2019t solve our problems. GDP growth alone is not the be-all and end-all of politics. We need policies to shore up the conservative units of society \u2014 family, neighborhood, faith, nation. We need policies that build solidarity, not just liberty.       The working class is the heart of the Republican Party. Once, businesspeople and entrepreneurs were at the center of the Republican imagination. Now it\u2019s clear that the party needs to stop catering to the corporate class and start focusing on the shop owners, the plumbers, the salaried workers. It needs to emphasize the dignity of work and honor those who are not trying to make millions, not looking for handouts, but just want to build middle-class lives in a stable social order. In Britain, the Conservative Party has built a majority around the working class, and that\u2019s what Republicans need to do here.       China changes everything. The rise of a 1.4-billion-person authoritarian superpower means that free trade no longer works because the Chinese are not playing by the same rules. The U.S. government cannot just stand back and let China control the new technologies. \u201cRepublicans are going to have to get used to the idea of industrial policy to counter China, at least in a few key industries,\u201d Mike Gallagher, a rising star among House Republicans, told me.       The managerial class betrays America. Many of the post-Reagan positions seem like steps to the left. But these Republicans combine a greater willingness to use government with a greater hostility to the managerial class. The solution to too much corporate power is not handing power to Elizabeth Warren and a cloud of federal regulators. There\u2019s a difference between empowering workers and empowering the Washington elite.      From these common premises the four senators go off in different directions.      Rubio bases his vision in Catholic social teaching. A year ago, he wrote an essay for First Things titled, \u201cWhat Economics Is For,\u201d arguing that the purpose of markets is not growth but allowing each person to find dignity in work. He followed that up with a speech at Catholic University calling for \u201ccommon-good capitalism\u201d (remember what I said about modifying phrases) in which he criticized contemporary capitalism for its obsessive focus on maximizing shareholder value.      His basic position is that American capitalism has become too much about finance. It needs to be balanced toward manufacturing. He, too, supports a \u201cpro-American industrial policy\u201d to meet the Chinese challenge.      Hawley is the most populist of the group. His core belief is that middle-class Americans have been betrayed by elites on every level \u2014 political elites, cultural elites, financial elites. The modern leadership class has one set of values \u2014 globalization, cosmopolitanism \u2014 and the Middle Americans have another set \u2014 family, home, rootedness, nation. Corporate elites have concentrated so much power that they now crush the yeomen masses.      Last November, Hawley gave a speech in which he sought to overturn the last 70 years of Republican foreign policy. He contended that the right had erred in trying to spread American values abroad. \u201cImperial domination violates our principles and it threatens our character. Our aim must be to prevent imperialism, not to exercise it; to stop domination, not foster it,\u201d he said.      Cotton has a less developed political vision but a more developed attitude: hawkishness. Whether it\u2019s China, the left, immigration or Big Tech, Cotton is hawkish. He sees a world threatened by disorder and gravitates toward the toughest positions in order to ward off threat. He is the most vocal foe of the Chinese \u201cpariah state.\u201d He wants sharp reductions in legal immigration.      Sasse is the most sociological of the crew. He is a Tocquevillian localist, who notes that most normal Americans go days without thinking of national politics. His vision is centered on the small associations \u2014 neighborhood groups, high school football teams, churches and community centers \u2014 where people find their greatest joys, satisfactions and supports. Government\u2019s job, he says, is to \u201ccreate a framework of ordered liberty\u201d so that people can make their family and neighborhood the center of their lives.      He is the most suspicious of government and politics today. \u201cI think politicians are arsonists,\u201d he told me over the phone last month. \u201cThe main thing the GOP does is try to light the Democrats on fire, and the main thing the Democrats do is light the Republicans on fire. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so little trust in politics.\u201d      Behind these public figures there is a posse of policy wonks and commentators supporting a new Working-Class Republicanism, including Oren Cass, Henry Olsen, J.D. Vance, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Saagar Enjeti, Samuel Hammond and, in his own way, Tucker Carlson.      Cass, for example, has created a new think tank, the American Compass, to push the GOP in a post-Trump direction. Cass, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, argues that free-market economists pay too much attention to GDP growth. What matters is the kind of growth and whether it allows people to lead stable lives. He says there\u2019s too much emphasis on consumption. People should be seen as producers, and government should create the kind of jobs that allow people to earn dignity through work.      He says the core of the economy is the industrial economy: manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure \u2014 making things in the physical world. \u201cInvestment in our economy has completely discounted the making of stuff,\u201d he told me in a recent interview. \u201cYou have a VC industry that goes entirely to software. Private equity financial flow is about buying and trading companies.\u201d Government needs to engage in \u201cpredistribution,\u201d to steer investment to manufacturing, and also to those middle American parts of the country that are currently left out.      \u201cThe American labor force cannot be changed into what the economy wants,\u201d Cass says. \u201cWe have to change the economy to what the American labor force can be successful in.\u201d      The intellectual future of conservatism will be wrestled over at a series of forums at the Center for Social, Cultural and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute that are being organized by Yuval Levin, a scholar there. Right now, the various factions are exchanging sarcastic one-liners on Twitter. Levin is bringing the players together. \u201cPeople should be talking to each other, not about each other,\u201d he told me.      Levin thinks the prevailing post-Trump viewpoints define the problem too much in economic terms. The crucial problem, he argues, is not economic; it\u2019s social: alienation. Millions of Americans don\u2019t feel part of anything they can trust. They feel no one is looking out for them. Trump was a false answer to their desire for social solidarity, but the desire can be a force for good.      \u201cWhat\u2019s needed,\u201d Levin says, \u201cis not just to expand economic conservatism beyond growth to also prioritize family, community and nation, but also to expand social conservatism beyond sexual ethics and religious liberty to prioritize family, community and nation. The coalition can be a powerful political force again if its different wings converge on these priorities, without each giving up on its long-standing aims.\u201d      The Republican Party looks completely brain dead at every spot Trump directly reaches. Off in the corners, though, there\u2019s a lot of intellectual ferment on the right. But if there is one thing I\u2019ve learned over the decades, it is never to underestimate the staying power of the dead Reagan paradigm.      The Wall Street Journal editorial page stands as a vigilant guardian of the corpse, eager to rebut all dissenters. Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are staunch defenders of Minimal-Government Conservatism. Sen. Ted Cruz seems to be positioning himself for a 2024 presidential run that seeks to triangulate all the pre-Trump and pro-Trump versions of the party into one stew.      And if Joe Biden defeats Trump and begins legislating, as seems more and more likely, there\u2019s also the possibility that Republicans will abandon any positive vision and revert to being a simple anti-government party \u2014 a party of opposition to whatever Biden is doing.      But over the long term, some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the GOP. In the first place, that\u2019s where Republican voters are. When push comes to shove, Republican politicians are going to choose their voters over their donor class.      Second, the working-class emphasis is the only way out of the demographic doom loop. If the party sticks with its old white high school-educated base, it will die. They just aren\u2019t making enough old white men. To have any shot of surviving as a major party, the GOP has to build a cross-racial alliance among working-class whites, working-class Hispanics and some working-class Blacks.      None of this works unless Republicans can deracialize their appeal \u2014 by which I mean they must stop pandering to the racists in the party and stop presenting themselves and seeing themselves as the party of white people \u2014 and wage a class struggle between diverse workers in their coalition and the highly educated coastal manager and professional class in the Democratic coalition.      Rubio, Hawley, Sasse and Cotton are inching toward a GOP future. What are the odds they\u2019ll succeed? They\u2019ve got to be way under 50-50.

We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming. We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear. Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again. To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in. To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror. To mend a broken society. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this: Britain is on the right track. </p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths. All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. We have thought we can pay our way. </p><p>That we can earn our living as a major industrial country... </p><p>...and we will always remain one. </p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past. </p><p>Because the truth is this. We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour... </p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge. </p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that. How we compete and thrive in this world... </p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise. </p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end... </p><p>...Britain on the rise. </p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>We saw it this summer. The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics... </p><p>...the best country in the world... </p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth. </p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French? </p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time. </p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds. And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy. </p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer. </p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland ...they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that ...and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom ...let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer. Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games ...and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces... </p><p>...the zinger on the zip-wire... </p><p>...the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society ...they did it beautifully in just three weeks. </p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them. Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now. 433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice. Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this: </p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done ...and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party. We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things. </p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive ...please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. </p><p>No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. </p><p>To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down ... I say ...well, yes, you've got a point. </p><p>I'll tell you what is down. </p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. </p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine ...the difference between living and dying... </p><p>...how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children. </p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done. </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests... </p><p>...and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it. </p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before ...I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty. </p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it. Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it. Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer... </p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already. Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether. Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too. </p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party. We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful. But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security. All around the world, countries are on the rise. </p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years ...but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too. </p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide. What do the countries on the rise have in common? </p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology. </p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common? </p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services. </p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece... </p><p>...while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months. </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide. My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise. And we here know how that is done. </p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration... </p><p>... the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in. </p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise. In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living ...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers ... not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses ... but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation ... to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one. It's not just about growth and GDP... </p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top. </p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer ... by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way. We don't preach about one nation but practise class war ...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things. </p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you. </p><p>They call us the party of the better-off ... no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so. </p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. My mission from the day I became leader was to change that. Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay. </p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society. </p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable. </p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too. Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'. No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need. </p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work. </p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children ... our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world. </p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich... it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most. </p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. These three things are essential to helping our people rise They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future ... they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country. </p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on. </p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that. Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan. </p><p>And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad. Getting the deficit down is essential for both. </p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan. It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped. </p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years. When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress. Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent. That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels... </p><p>...keeping mortgages low. Leaving more money in your pockets. Giving businesses more confidence to invest. Creating more jobs. </p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures. Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector. That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it. They call it Plan B and it goes like this: We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. Let me tell you why it's not. </p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means. </p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world. </p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard. </p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year. Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future. And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made. </p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much. How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing? I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing. </p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. </p><p>Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money. </p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money. </p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing. I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all. </p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes? He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque. </p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the government's money: their money. </p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK? </p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here ... it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here. </p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden ... and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour. </p><p>Under Labour. </p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold ...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses ... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy ...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future ...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy ...more enterprising, more aspirational ...and it's taking shape already. </p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. We're making things again. We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years. </p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. We're number one in the world for offshore wind. Number one in the world for tidal power. The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise. We're showing we can do it. Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got ...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups. </p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too. And look what's happening. In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent ... to China - 40 per cent ... to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm ... helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies. </p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China ...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ... I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts ... and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand ...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple. For a business to expand, it needs places to build. If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere. </p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\" ... but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard. </p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder. But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? 33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on. </p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house ...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage ...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain. </p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. </p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                    </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare. Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one. We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people. Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two. More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe. Let me put it simply. Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago. He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness. And Disease. </p><p>Here are mine. </p><p>First, unfairness. </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves? </p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice. </p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever. </p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit. </p><p>We must be crazy. </p><p>So this is what we've done. </p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours. </p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit. And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't? </p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required. </p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole ...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training. </p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme. </p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless ...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare. </p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office? </p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them. Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery... </p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today. </p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. Educate all our children. </p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind ...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure. </p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area ...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood. </p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening. </p><p>We've heard from some of them this week ... not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come... </p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools. </p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools ...independent schools, in the state sector. </p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway. </p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative. </p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits. Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options. Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking. </p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question: Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances? </p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way. </p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no. </p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers ...Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work ...More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety...the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No. </p><p>When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding? You hear the same thing over and over again. </p><p>'What can you expect with children like these?' they say. 'These children are disadvantaged.' </p><p>Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms? </p><p>It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back. </p><p>Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act. </p><p>Because our children can't wait. </p><p>So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say: </p><p>I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child. </p><p>And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school ...I say: yes - you're absolutely right. </p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. </p><p>I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it. </p><p>                     CONCLUSION                    </p><p>I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire. </p><p>It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. </p><p>My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought. He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life. </p><p>Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child. Probably a lonely child. </p><p>But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it. </p><p>When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings. </p><p>He told me what he was most proud of. It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family. </p><p>Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off. Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story. </p><p>Work hard. Family comes first. But put back in to the community too. </p><p>There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country. And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. </p><p>This is still the greatest country on earth. We showed that again this summer. 22nd in world population. 3rd in the medals table. </p><p>But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested. How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others. </p><p>As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door: Those who can should, those who can't we will always help. </p><p>The job of this party ... of this government ... is to help to bring out the best in this country. Because at our best we're unbeatable. </p><p>We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again. </p><p>This is the country that ... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years. </p><p>We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile .... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do. </p><p>Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win? Yes. </p><p>Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life. Yes. </p><p>Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world? Yes. Of course we can. </p><p>Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge - let's build an aspiration nation ...let's get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Deficit, paid down. Tough decisions, taJken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way. </p><p>We know what it takes to win ... to win in the tough world of today ... to win for all our people ... to win for Britain. </p><p>So let's get out there and do it. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-5065497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56TK-D2K1-DXDT-6288-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2014-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5683\"/><timeReceived>6:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>October 10, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLR8</classCode><className>UK CONSERVATIVE PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home.

When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax.

You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers...

Ivan, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died aged six in 2009.</p><p>The main theme of the speech was a rallying cry to people who 'strive to make a better life for themselves' as Mr Cameron sought to recast the Tories as not the party of the better off but 'the party of the want to be better-off'.</p><p>He signalled his intention to challenge Labour attempts to portray him as out of touch,  declaring: 'I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.'</p><p>He went on: 'To all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school.

Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. Getting the deficit down is essential.</p><p>LABOUR</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>TAX</p><p>Ed Miliband... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK?</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.'</p><p>He used the speech in Birmingham to set the battleground for the next election, putting welfare, education and economic reforms at the centre of the Tories' pitch for an overall majority at the next election.</p><p>He said: 'Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge - let's build an aspiration nation. Let's get Britain on the rise.</p><p>'Deficit, paid down. Tough decisions, taken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way.\u00a0 </p><p>'We know what it takes to win in the tough world of today, to win for all our people, to win for Britain.\u00a0 So let's get out there and do it.'</p><p>He also revived his pitch of 'compassionate Conservationism', arguing his party had to represent everyone in Britain.</p><p>'My mission from the day I became leader was to.. show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>'But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>'That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.'</p><p>And he defied critics of his decision to protect foreign aid from cuts, telling the Conservative party they should be 'proud' to have helped to vaccinate 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>On tax, Mr Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of thinking all workers' income belongs to the state\u00a0 who lets them keep some of it thought tax cuts.</p><p>He added: 'We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.'</p><p>Mr Cameron has often paid tribute to the Paralympics for its power in changing social attitudes.</p><p>He added: 'I was trying to think of my favourite moment. Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>'No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years, nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>'My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.'</p><p>He went on: 'There are so many people to thank for this summer.\u00a0 Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games...</p><p>'And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society, they did it beautifully in just three weeks.'</p><p>                       FASHION VERDICT: 'First lady fashion at its finest'                                        </p><p>She makes it all look so effortless doesn't she? In her stylish royal blue Joseph shift dress and LK Bennett shoes, Samantha Cameron manages to singlehandedly knock the other pretenders - Miriam Clegg and Justine Miliband - out of the fashion spotlight.</p><p>If being a working mum of three and the wife of one of the most men in the country wasn't enough, Sam Cam manages to always hit the right style note too.</p><p>Part of this is to do with her alliance with stylish advisor Isabel Spearman who helps Samantha - also an ambassador for the British Fashion Council - navigate the fashion minefield. </p><p>Party conferences have become something of a showcase for the leader's wives in recent years and the PM's wife has really made them her forte. </p><p>She arrived on day one in a pair of trendy Superga plimsolls, black trousers and a luxurious grey cashmere v-neck jumper before changing into a rather-more fashionable get-up of skinny Topshop jeans, Cos jumper and Zara heels for the evening.</p><p>For the big day today, Samantha chose to wear something from one of her favourite labels, Joseph. </p><p>The stretch crepe 'April' dress, \u00a3345, was teamed with an Emilia Wickstead belt - worn in her signature waist-cinching style - and a pair of LK Bennett grey suede 'Harper' shoes (\u00a3195).</p><p>Not for her a contrived attempt to wear a budget frock and cheapo shoes to the big occasions in a bid to convince voters she's 'every woman'.</p><p> As a descendent of the wealthy Astor family, there's no real point in Samantha attempting to be a 'frugalista' a la Justine Milliband in her \u00a348 QVC frock.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So once again, Samantha pulls off 'First Lady fashion' at its finest. </p><p>It's surely only a matter of time before a similar ensemble is sported by those other international fashion ambassadors the Duchess of Cambridge and Michelle Obama.</p><p>                     NICOLE MOWBRAY, EDITOR, LIFE &amp; STYLE                   </p><p>                     Britain on the rise: <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>full speech to the Tory party conference                   </p><p>In May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming.</p><p>We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.</p><p>At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.</p><p>Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again.</p><p>To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.</p><p>To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.</p><p>To mend a broken society.</p><p>Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:</p><p>Britain is on the right track.</p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p>We have thought we can pay our way.\u00a0 That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.</p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this.\u00a0 We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers...

Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to break up Big Tech companies. The proposal entails appointing a bunch of regulators to undo mergers that her administration would deem anti-competitive. Warren's plan would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year as a \"platform utility\" and prohibit them from selling their own products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considering the prevalent loathing of Big Tech and capitalism in general, it's likely to be a popular idea. Many conservatives, angered at social media platforms, will also find the notion of breaking up these companies agreeable. But there are a number of good economic and idealistic reasons to oppose Warren's plan.</p><p>Warren's plan wouldn't only strip the incentive for big companies to invest in growth and innovation; it would inhibit small-business innovation as well. It's true that Big Tech frequently swallows enterprises to eliminate competition. Yet many times smaller tech firms don't have access to capital that allows them to bring big ideas to fruition, or they can't take the risk.</p><p>I look forward to the day that market forces, rather than meddling politicians with aversions to the profit motive, smash Apple for good. But does anyone believe a gaggle of technocratic political appointees are going to do a better job of allocating investments?</p><p>\"Twenty-five years ago,\" Warren writes, \"Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It's a great story - but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\"</p><p>The fact that Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't exist 25 years ago tells us the opposite. It highlights how quickly innovative ideas can transform the marketplace in an era of relative deregulation. I'd tell you to ask the executives at Woolworth's or Blockbuster - and soon AOL, MySpace and Sears - but there aren't any.</p><p>Apple or Amazon were early adapters of the market's new realities. Now, some of their businesses are forced to compete with other giants like Walmart or Samsung. This has been beneficial for consumers.</p><p>That hasn't stopped Warren from acting as if tech companies are the new Standard Oil. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody - even the biggest and most powerful companies in America - plays by the rules,\" Warren claims. This misleading turn of phrase has become standard on the left, which often acts as if companies are breaking the law or using \"loopholes\" when they fail to adhere to the imaginary regulations. Tech companies aren't breaking any rules by ignoring Warren's fictitious strictures. We already have a place to adjudicate mergers: the Justice Department. They already do a terrible job . And if the DOJ is susceptible to partisan pressure, surely a second regulatory body based on capricious progressive concepts of the common good would likewise be ripe for abuse.</p><p>A number of voters, regrettably, seem to believe that increasing regulatory oversight helps alleviate the destructive relationship between government and business. Yet, by giving politically motivated regulators expansive powers to dictate how and when companies can grow, Warren would not only imbue government with more power to pick winners and losers, she would further incentivize CEOs to placate government officials and politicians rather than do what's best for their companies and consumers. It would be a lot more productive if we left markets to compete and instead broke up government power.</p><p>\"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" Warren asked on Twitter after Facebook took down some of her ads. \"Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>A person doesn't need to be exceptionally perceptive to notice that Warren's grievance regarding a \"single censor\" shutting down debate on social media is weakened by the fact that she went to a competing social media platform to perpetuate the debate. Nor did it take much work to find out that virtually every major news site had covered her plan .</p><p>Her own tweet debunks the notion that a sole social media site can dominate news coverage . Taking Instagram away from Facebook would do nothing to induce the social media giant to embrace open debate. However, forcing a private entity to run ads that call for its own destruction is an unambiguous attack on free expression.</p><p>Facebook contends they removed Warren's ads because they violated rules against use of its corporate logo. \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\" the company explained. That makes the tech giant a far more robust space for free expression than your average news channel. And as sure as state intervention into TV news \"fairness\" would backfire so, too, will opening the door to Big Tech intervention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-605388bc472a11e99c5b00163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5N-2T11-JCBN-D2YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Union Leader Corp.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.  </p><p>      David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much for joining me it seems, every time--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR</emphasis>: Oh I thought you just had me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see the pop I think we're going to get?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them because they think they're going to compete in the United States?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet. Alibaba completely dominates--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there. And they want to go global.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you and I have seen. We've never seen this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big.   </p><p>      But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it actually can grow from here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So clearly that's the most important thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got to own it just because it's big.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the global economy.  </p><p>      0611  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0619  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at $38.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS</emphasis>: Look how young you are Tom.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible) moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky helped me with that day with Facebook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali-who? Ten-what? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook, in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.  </p><p>      But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict what happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Fabulous.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.  </p><p>      DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TEAM</emphasis>: Scarlet, good, you're welcome.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Joining us this morning.  </p><p>      0620  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0652  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line this morning? Right up front?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: No I would not consider it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: It's not going to go in my pocket.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: It's a small iPad.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I want a phone. Thank you.  </p><p>      0653  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0742  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy. Maybe it's simply that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Battery life.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: OK so I'm not so far off then.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: No the battery's everything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every other manufacturer is trying to grow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly selling faster.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: And the other--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's a mini-mini.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: It's a mini iPad mini.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It's a mini-mini.  </p><p>      0743  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0744  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth out of these two products?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the dominant technology producer in the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.  </p><p>      0745  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0750  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: David Kirkpatrick?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Fair, fair.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO. He's not going away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yes he did.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Probably.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: He could.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out very well.  </p><p>      STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</emphasis>: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss. In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not going away. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: That's the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and you subcontract to other people.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an incredible business in the old legacy business model.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ODLAND</emphasis>: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a business--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: That's a key point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ODLAND</emphasis>: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And it's hard to move.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of money to \"update it\" et cetera.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything over to a brand new platform wasn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ODLAND</emphasis>: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and really dangerous and hard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yep.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is that feasible?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ODLAND</emphasis>: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His focus is on the US next.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of the question.  </p><p>      I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow him to consider anything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: OK fair.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight. Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything itself.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here. Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ODLAND</emphasis>: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores, Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have really increased their business.   </p><p>      So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with cross ownership.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into the whole physical space here for these companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: It's a whole new development.  </p><p>      0754  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0757  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: The ecosystem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or qualitative--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same people.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Our producers outdid themselves today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.  </p><p>      0758   </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He is the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" and we want to find out what the congressional effect of yesterday's testimony of Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg for Facebook as well as Jack Dorsey the Chief Executive of Twitter may have had on investor's appetite for both of these companies.  </p><p>      David, what did you make of their presentation before Congress and what do you think investor ought to take away?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Well, thanks Pimm. I wasn't -- well, you know, it's a different thing for each company. And I think that Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg take a quite different view of the whole thing. I think the company has came out of it well, in the sense I would call the more or less on this case and that's partly because with Google not showing up a lot of heat was taken off them and put on Google simply for its failure to show.   </p><p>      I also think they were more or less stared the toughest question that might have hope they would asked.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Such as?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Well, you know, why did this happen? And why is -- you know, considering that the New York Times had published an article today before, which unfortunately hadn't gone in the print paper that I'm aware of about Libya and how warlords are using it to target each other and selling on is what Facebook et cetera. You know, it just gives us the show how absolutely unprepared they continue to be for the scale of abuse to their platform.  </p><p>      And you know, you have to ask if it's happening there, what's still happening here that we just don't know about yet. The problem with this platform is they're so abusable that there are essentially infinite ways to gain their system and they have enormous distribution power. And therefore they become weaponized and they're trying desperately to deal with that and I do admire and respect many of the gestures they're taking and the people they've hired to try to step up to the problem but they have not yet fully step up to the problem. And I think it's very different from Twitter than for Facebook though.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  You know, it's interesting you talked about how unprepared they are for this. I was sort of shocked that they weren't grilled more on this subject of the actual panel which was the security issue and foreign agents using their platforms. So there's a lack of scrutiny over the topic of the actual hearing suggest to you that there's going to be zero asking from a congressional standpoint on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Probably you're right about that. I would say that's very good speculation. You know, theoretically what we really were expecting was keep probing about Russian manipulation in particular and what is being put in place to prevent it from harming the election this fall.  </p><p>      We didn't really hear that in any great detail. We heard a lot of -- in my opinion fairly rode statements that have the same thing that have been said in public before by Sheryl Sandberg. And I think Jack Dorsey more candidly and with a more humility acknowledge the Twitter really isn't yet doing enough and to some extent doesn't even know what to do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  The different thing, the two companies in my opinion, is that Facebook desperately wants to convey the notion that they have this in hand. Jack doesn't have that arrogance. He also doesn't have the money to even make that claim because Twitter is so much less profitable and so much smart. But you know, in Mark Zuckerberg with Kara Swisher month or so ago, he actually said the problem would be solved by the end of 2019 with artificial intelligence.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Go back and check it out. I mean, that just totally wrong and really naive and dangerous. Sheryl didn't say that exactly yesterday but she really less -- you know, this thing it's on us that we want to prepare to be as a very back candid way of accepting responsibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  He doesn't really say, oh my gosh, we are ashamed that we built the platform that did not have sufficient controls and protections against abuse. We are desperately trying to fix it. We don't fully know how we need your help government outside civil society, please help us, that what they should be saying.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  You know, I'm really glad you said that, David, because -- I think I don't know about Pimm, but I know that when I was listening to the testimony I found Jack Dorsey to be a lot more humble and thoughtful about his answers and I thought Sheryl Sandberg was very practiced and very polished but it felt like she was reading the script that she had been giving or she drafted ahead of time. And I feel like David, you're kind of reiterating that feeling even though when we talked with the people yesterday they thought that Sheryl Sandberg had done the better job and certainly that seems to be what the stock action reflected. What's your view on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  You just restated exactly what I believe. I think Sheryl is a very-scripted, relatively insincere public speaker particularly at this point. I think much of the problem that happen on Facebook that have lead to this manipulation and abuse of Facebook in the United States and Germany, in Brexit and so many other instances really are a consequence of the failure to build controls into the advertising system that she over saw.   </p><p>      Therefore she is personally responsible for many of the thing that went wrong. And she essentially escaping any kind of real accounting for that and nobody -- because that's unfortunately even though some have said yesterday Senate question showed more intelligence and I thought Senator Warner actually on Bloomberg bragging about how he thought that this committee has smarter questions than the hearing when Zuckerberg was testifying. I really don't think that on balance the senators really understand how the stuff all works and who is responsible. And, you know, what any of the mechanics are inside the company. And that's partly because Facebook has been consummately un-transparent. I mean, they really do not show any real humility, zero. And that is a big difference with Jack Dorsey.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  David Kirkpatrick --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  They don't know what they're doing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  OK. Look into the future and we're going to continue the conversation. I just want you to look into the future for us, maybe 5, maybe even a decade from now. Do you believe that there will be government regulations that in some way affect social media technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  100%. I would say it's a lot less than 10 years. We're talking about two-year probably and it will be very fragmented global regulatory environment that they're going to be getting regulation all over the place where we're seeing that in Europe quite dramatically. It's happening. It will happen here, totally.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  And maybe investors are already picking up on that because I just looking at the trading in Facebook shares, they are down now heading for the fifth consecutive trading session of losses, Facebook shares are now lower on the year, they are down about six percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes. We're going to continue conversation with David Kirkpatrick. So stay where you are, because we can talk about Facebook. Facebook is actually the one laggard among all of them that is down on the air. People talk about the same rally and how that's really driven stock market. Well, certainly Facebook has been entirely left out of that and sort of interesting to see in question whether it's the sort of lack of stability that David Kirkpatrick was talking about that perhaps lead into that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Well compare to the performance of Twitter and not to say that the stock performance is a proxy for whether the companies are going to be regulator or not but Twitter shares they're up more than 30% this year, compare that to Facebook, the shares as I said they are down about six in quarter percent so far this year.  </p><p>      We've got much more with David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy and also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" talking about what happens when government regulator make it very interested in your business.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Our guest is David Kirkpatrick, he is the founder and the chief executive of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect.\"  </p><p>      David, I'm going to have you put three Ph.D. dissertations into a very short amount of time. I want to get your thoughts on robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning. Are these are just buzz words or are we going to have to learn more details about the companies that create this kind of technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Well, those are huge, huge issues that are all deeply connected. Certainly, machine learning is a significant subset of artificial intelligence and robotics is increasingly control by artificial intelligence.  </p><p>      We are going to see these technologies and particularly A.I. in general become a more and more central part of how systems work around everything we do in our personal lives, in our work lives, in industrial circumstances in government, everywhere it's just the direction that technology is heading including even in the area we were discussing for social media where it's -- you know A.I. is said to be the technology that will solve the problem by some practitioners. So yes, it's huge. These are the technologies to watch.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So what's the company -- which companies are the ones to watch who are best sort of adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence to practical applications and will be a commercial success who haven't already been recognize?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Well, the interesting thing about that is it's not a surprising answer. There are a lot of small companies that are doing very innovative thing in terms of the actual software but the key with A.I. to make it successful is that scale of the dataset that you have to work with which then you use to train \"machine learning\" which takes, you know, continued passes over a decision making process with more and more and more data and gets better and better.   </p><p>      So therefore the people who have the most data who are also working on A.I. are the ones who will win and that basically limited to a very small group, which is Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft to a lesser extend, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, you know, there are companies that have a very good -- their main expertise in certain fields like Uber and self-driving and, you know, delivery of humans and other things but in general I would say the companies that are going to win on A.I. are Amazon, Facebook and Google must of all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  David Kirkpatrick, full disclosure I have the pressure of attending one of your Techonomy sessions and I learned that companies such as SAPOracle, those people that are in the background of all of these databases particularly for industrial applications they are also making Artificial Intelligence in the mining of data a key stone of their strategy to help their costumers. Can you elaborate on that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Well, certainly and SAP is an example of a very large company that also has access to an awful lot of data and they're working really hard with A.I. So it's not to say they aren't doing smart stuff. It's similarly salesforce.com, Oracle as you mentioned, IBM is of course a company who is watching product for several years, kind of leading their charge of image management and they are talking more about A.I. and lesson about watching now but certainly IBM believes A.I. is key to a future.  </p><p>      You know, I wouldn't think it's over stating it to say every technology company and consumer or enterprise oriented software and services recognizes that A.I. is probably the central technology that will determine whether they win or not. It's how well do you deploy A.I. and A.I. solutions, whether you're building yourself or you are buying it and deploying it that was built by others.  </p><p>      One of the things that I think we probably will see going back to what I said before about Amazon and other is that especially we get AmazonGoogle and Microsoft all offer their own cloud hosting services, they will be able to offer A.I. services as part of their cloud services to enterprise customers and start aps and that is going to be a key differentiator that they will use to try to compete with one another. And again, Amazon, being the largest has the biggest advantage thought.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  You know, I have to wonder as you talk, David, as you were saying earlier about the big tech giants winning just simply due to the scope of the data that they have. Will this scrunch (ph) to innovation? In other words, without democratization of that data and of that power, that ability to try to come up with the best algorithms and the best machine learning processes, are we going not get necessarily the best ideas?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  No, in a sense it's the scale of these companies to begin with that is at risk of scrunching innovation or concentrating it unfairly. I think that -- this is I believe and I think goes to the hearing yesterday and why it was somewhat disappointed (ph) them.  </p><p>      The few scale of Facebook, Google and Amazon in particular is such a new development in society and so overwhelming the important from so many aspects because there's -- the power they have to control economics activity to gain insight into social and societal and even governmental function to develop A.I. So the A.I. piece is just one part of that but yes, this companies had an unfair advantage because of the scale and, you know, it's one the reason why Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, worth of $160 -- $170 billion, the market has recognize that.   </p><p>      But it's very intertwined set of issues that have super complicated. It is a big topic for us to Techonomy and I'm glad that Pimm mentioned what we're doing here because we really think that the Techonomy host conference and publishes stuff on our website, Techonomy.com, et cetera.  </p><p>      This whole issue of A.I. has impacted influence in long-term implications and this is simultaneous of the scale of the small number of companies. These are some of the biggest strategic questions that not only business but society has rustled with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  David Kirkpatrick, to get a little bit more in the weeds because Amazon and the Amazon factor always in the background when it comes to any kind of commercial enterprise now whether it's web services, you described or retail and indeed even the healthcare initiative, what do you believe will be the next industry to be disrupted by Amazon?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  One that I would be pretty seriously expecting is banking. They've got -- and I would say, probably they've got their eyes on insurance as well. I mean, the healthcare thing is still very nascent but they did hire a very immanent healthcare writer and research doctor to work them and at JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a kind of overall sort of employee oriented project to begin with --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOX</emphasis>:  Right. But do you think insurance and banking, the finance industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Oh, yeah. I mean, look, think of how much banking inspiration Amazon must already had given the scale of commerce that is being concentrated through its platform. You know, it's getting enormous influence. I mean, certainly it offers credit card services are at various sorts and partnership with others now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  And that's just the beginning. You know, the economy is going digital. So the digital dominant companies are going to have an advantage in almost every industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  But don't think want to avoid the regulation, the oversight that comes along with paying a bank?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIRKPATRICK</emphasis>:  Maybe. Maybe not. I mean, I think Amazon and Jeff Bezos is -- this is one thing he does share with Elon Musk is fearlessness and a willingness to confront unexpected, you know, obstacles and just sort of power through. I don't think that a fear of banking regulation would stop Amazon what the insight that they really wanted to get into that.  </p><p>      I think what would stop and potentially is the fear of antitrust or some kind of new regulatory oversight that they're disparate to avoid but again, the conventional antitrust doesn't even really apply because Amazon tacticals (ph) are in so many industry simultaneously that they're gaining additional scale without actually dominating anyone industry.  </p><p>      I mean, they do dominate online retails so that we could say, if you design as an industry and itself but it isn't retail, it's just the online portion of retail. So I don't think they wouldn't a treat to banks of the outset.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Our next guest is David Kirkpatrick. He is the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" and we want to find out what the congressional effect of yesterday's testimony of Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg for Facebook as well as Jack Dorsey the Chief Executive of Twitter may have had on investor's appetite for both of these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David, what did you make of their presentation before Congress and what do you think investor ought to take away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID KIRKPATRICK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND FOUNDER OF TECHONOMY MEDIA: Well, thanks Pimm. I wasn't -- well, you know, it's a different thing for each company. And I think that Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg take a quite different view of the whole thing. I think the company has came out of it well, in the sense I would call the more or less on this case and that's partly because with Google not showing up a lot of heat was taken off them and put on Google simply for its failure to show.</p><p>I also think they were more or less stared the toughest question that might have hope they would asked.</p><p>FOX: Such as?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, you know, why did this happen? And why is -- you know, considering that the New York Times had published an article today before, which unfortunately hadn't gone in the print paper that I'm aware of about Libya and how warlords are using it to target each other and selling on is what Facebook et cetera. You know, it just gives us the show how absolutely unprepared they continue to be for the scale of abuse to their platform.</p><p>And you know, you have to ask if it's happening there, what's still happening here that we just don't know about yet. The problem with this platform is they're so abusable that there are essentially infinite ways to gain their system and they have enormous distribution power. And therefore they become weaponized and they're trying desperately to deal with that and I do admire and respect many of the gestures they're taking and the people they've hired to try to step up to the problem but they have not yet fully step up to the problem. And I think it's very different from Twitter than for Facebook though.</p><p>LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: You know, it's interesting you talked about how unprepared they are for this. I was sort of shocked that they weren't grilled more on this subject of the actual panel which was the security issue and foreign agents using their platforms. So there's a lack of scrutiny over the topic of the actual hearing suggest to you that there's going to be zero asking from a congressional standpoint on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Probably you're right about that. I would say that's very good speculation. You know, theoretically what we really were expecting was keep probing about Russian manipulation in particular and what is being put in place to prevent it from harming the election this fall.</p><p>We didn't really hear that in any great detail. We heard a lot of -- in my opinion fairly rode statements that have the same thing that have been said in public before by Sheryl Sandberg. And I think Jack Dorsey more candidly and with a more humility acknowledge the Twitter really isn't yet doing enough and to some extent doesn't even know what to do.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: The different thing, the two companies in my opinion, is that Facebook desperately wants to convey the notion that they have this in hand. Jack doesn't have that arrogance. He also doesn't have the money to even make that claim because Twitter is so much less profitable and so much smart. But you know, in Mark Zuckerberg with Kara Swisher month or so ago, he actually said the problem would be solved by the end of 2019 with artificial intelligence.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Go back and check it out. I mean, that just totally wrong and really naive and dangerous. Sheryl didn't say that exactly yesterday but she really less -- you know, this thing it's on us that we want to prepare to be as a very back candid way of accepting responsibility.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He doesn't really say, oh my gosh, we are ashamed that we built the platform that did not have sufficient controls and protections against abuse. We are desperately trying to fix it. We don't fully know how we need your help government outside civil society, please help us, that what they should be saying.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I'm really glad you said that, David, because -- I think I don't know about Pimm, but I know that when I was listening to the testimony I found Jack Dorsey to be a lot more humble and thoughtful about his answers and I thought Sheryl Sandberg was very practiced and very polished but it felt like she was reading the script that she had been giving or she drafted ahead of time. And I feel like David, you're kind of reiterating that feeling even though when we talked with the people yesterday they thought that Sheryl Sandberg had done the better job and certainly that seems to be what the stock action reflected. What's your view on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You just restated exactly what I believe. I think Sheryl is a very-scripted, relatively insincere public speaker particularly at this point. I think much of the problem that happen on Facebook that have lead to this manipulation and abuse of Facebook in the United States and Germany, in Brexit and so many other instances really are a consequence of the failure to build controls into the advertising system that she over saw.</p><p>Therefore she is personally responsible for many of the thing that went wrong. And she essentially escaping any kind of real accounting for that and nobody -- because that's unfortunately even though some have said yesterday Senate question showed more intelligence and I thought Senator Warner actually on Bloomberg bragging about how he thought that this committee has smarter questions than the hearing when Zuckerberg was testifying. I really don't think that on balance the senators really understand how the stuff all works and who is responsible. And, you know, what any of the mechanics are inside the company. And that's partly because Facebook has been consummately un-transparent. I mean, they really do not show any real humility, zero. And that is a big difference with Jack Dorsey.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick --</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: They don't know what they're doing.</p><p>FOX: OK. Look into the future and we're going to continue the conversation. I just want you to look into the future for us, maybe 5, maybe even a decade from now. Do you believe that there will be government regulations that in some way affect social media technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: 100%. I would say it's a lot less than 10 years. We're talking about two-year probably and it will be very fragmented global regulatory environment that they're going to be getting regulation all over the place where we're seeing that in Europe quite dramatically. It's happening. It will happen here, totally.</p><p>FOX: And maybe investors are already picking up on that because I just looking at the trading in Facebook shares, they are down now heading for the fifth consecutive trading session of losses, Facebook shares are now lower on the year, they are down about six percent.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes. We're going to continue conversation with David Kirkpatrick. So stay where you are, because we can talk about Facebook. Facebook is actually the one laggard among all of them that is down on the air. People talk about the same rally and how that's really driven stock market. Well, certainly Facebook has been entirely left out of that and sort of interesting to see in question whether it's the sort of lack of stability that David Kirkpatrick was talking about that perhaps lead into that.</p><p>FOX: Well compare to the performance of Twitter and not to say that the stock performance is a proxy for whether the companies are going to be regulator or not but Twitter shares they're up more than 30% this year, compare that to Facebook, the shares as I said they are down about six in quarter percent so far this year.</p><p>We've got much more with David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy and also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" talking about what happens when government regulator make it very interested in your business.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FOX: Our guest is David Kirkpatrick, he is the founder and the chief executive of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>David, I'm going to have you put three Ph.D. dissertations into a very short amount of time. I want to get your thoughts on robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning. Are these are just buzz words or are we going to have to learn more details about the companies that create this kind of technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, those are huge, huge issues that are all deeply connected. Certainly, machine learning is a significant subset of artificial intelligence and robotics is increasingly control by artificial intelligence.</p><p>We are going to see these technologies and particularly A.I. in general become a more and more central part of how systems work around everything we do in our personal lives, in our work lives, in industrial circumstances in government, everywhere it's just the direction that technology is heading including even in the area we were discussing for social media where it's -- you know A.I. is said to be the technology that will solve the problem by some practitioners. So yes, it's huge. These are the technologies to watch.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: So what's the company -- which companies are the ones to watch who are best sort of adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence to practical applications and will be a commercial success who haven't already been recognize?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, the interesting thing about that is it's not a surprising answer. There are a lot of small companies that are doing very innovative thing in terms of the actual software but the key with A.I. to make it successful is that scale of the dataset that you have to work with which then you use to train \"machine learning\" which takes, you know, continued passes over a decision making process with more and more and more data and gets better and better.</p><p>So therefore the people who have the most data who are also working on A.I. are the ones who will win and that basically limited to a very small group, which is Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft to a lesser extend, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, you know, there are companies that have a very good -- their main expertise in certain fields like Uber and self-driving and, you know, delivery of humans and other things but in general I would say the companies that are going to win on A.I. are Amazon, Facebook and Google must of all.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick, full disclosure I have the pressure of attending one of your Techonomy sessions and I learned that companies such as SAP Oracle, those people that are in the background of all of these databases particularly for industrial applications they are also making Artificial Intelligence in the mining of data a key stone of their strategy to help their costumers. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, certainly and SAP is an example of a very large company that also has access to an awful lot of data and they're working really hard with A.I. So it's not to say they aren't doing smart stuff. It's similarly salesforce.com, Oracle as you mentioned, IBM is of course a company who is watching product for several years, kind of leading their charge of image management and they are talking more about A.I. and lesson about watching now but certainly IBM believes A.I. is key to a future.</p><p>You know, I wouldn't think it's over stating it to say every technology company and consumer or enterprise oriented software and services recognizes that A.I. is probably the central technology that will determine whether they win or not. It's how well do you deploy A.I. and A.I. solutions, whether you're building yourself or you are buying it and deploying it that was built by others.</p><p>One of the things that I think we probably will see going back to what I said before about Amazon and other is that especially we get Amazon Google and Microsoft all offer their own cloud hosting services, they will be able to offer A.I. services as part of their cloud services to enterprise customers and start aps and that is going to be a key differentiator that they will use to try to compete with one another. And again, Amazon, being the largest has the biggest advantage thought.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I have to wonder as you talk, David, as you were saying earlier about the big tech giants winning just simply due to the scope of the data that they have. Will this scrunch (ph) to innovation? In other words, without democratization of that data and of that power, that ability to try to come up with the best algorithms and the best machine learning processes, are we going not get necessarily the best ideas?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No, in a sense it's the scale of these companies to begin with that is at risk of scrunching innovation or concentrating it unfairly. I think that -- this is I believe and I think goes to the hearing yesterday and why it was somewhat disappointed (ph) them.</p><p>The few scale of Facebook, Google and Amazon in particular is such a new development in society and so overwhelming the important from so many aspects because there's -- the power they have to control economics activity to gain insight into social and societal and even governmental function to develop A.I. So the A.I. piece is just one part of that but yes, this companies had an unfair advantage because of the scale and, you know, it's one the reason why Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, worth of $160 -- $170 billion, the market has recognize that.</p><p>But it's very intertwined set of issues that have super complicated. It is a big topic for us to Techonomy and I'm glad that Pimm mentioned what we're doing here because we really think that the Techonomy host conference and publishes stuff on our website, Techonomy.com, et cetera.</p><p>This whole issue of A.I. has impacted influence in long-term implications and this is simultaneous of the scale of the small number of companies. These are some of the biggest strategic questions that not only business but society has rustled with.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick, to get a little bit more in the weeds because Amazon and the Amazon factor always in the background when it comes to any kind of commercial enterprise now whether it's web services, you described or retail and indeed even the healthcare initiative, what do you believe will be the next industry to be disrupted by Amazon?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: One that I would be pretty seriously expecting is banking. They've got -- and I would say, probably they've got their eyes on insurance as well. I mean, the healthcare thing is still very nascent but they did hire a very immanent healthcare writer and research doctor to work them and at JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a kind of overall sort of employee oriented project to begin with --</p><p>FOX: Right. But do you think insurance and banking, the finance industry?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Oh, yeah. I mean, look, think of how much banking inspiration Amazon must already had given the scale of commerce that is being concentrated through its platform. You know, it's getting enormous influence. I mean, certainly it offers credit card services are at various sorts and partnership with others now.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And that's just the beginning. You know, the economy is going digital. So the digital dominant companies are going to have an advantage in almost every industry.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: But don't think want to avoid the regulation, the oversight that comes along with paying a bank?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Maybe. Maybe not. I mean, I think Amazon and Jeff Bezos is -- this is one thing he does share with Elon Musk is fearlessness and a willingness to confront unexpected, you know, obstacles and just sort of power through. I don't think that a fear of banking regulation would stop Amazon what the insight that they really wanted to get into that.</p><p>I think what would stop and potentially is the fear of antitrust or some kind of new regulatory oversight that they're disparate to avoid but again, the conventional antitrust doesn't even really apply because Amazon tacticals (ph) are in so many industry simultaneously that they're gaining additional scale without actually dominating anyone industry.</p><p>I mean, they do dominate online retails so that we could say, if you design as an industry and itself but it isn't retail, it's just the online portion of retail. So I don't think they wouldn't a treat to banks of the outset. It would be after they'd taken advantage of all their other scale advantages that they begin to post a threat.</p><p>It's also, think about the fact in their healthcare they are partnering with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>FOX: Indeed.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Right? What about that?</p><p>FOX: Yes, never of the information that they can put together with the joint venture with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Much appreciated, David Kirkpatrick, he is the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy, also the author of the book, the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Our next guest is David Kirkpatrick.  He is  the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy.  He is also the author of  the \"Facebook Effect\" and we want to find out what the congressional effect  of yesterday's testimony of Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg for  Facebook as well as Jack Dorsey the Chief Executive of Twitter may have had  on investor's appetite for both of these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David, what did you make of their presentation before Congress and what do  you think investor ought to take away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID KIRKPATRICK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND FOUNDER OF TECHONOMY MEDIA:   Well, thanks Pimm.  I wasn't -- well, you know, it's a different thing for  each company.  And I think that Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg take a  quite different view of the whole thing.  I think the company has came out  of it well, in the sense I would call the more or less on this case and  that's partly because with Google not showing up a lot of heat was taken  off them and put on Google simply for its failure to show.</p><p>I also think they were more or less stared the toughest question that might  have hope they would asked.</p><p>FOX:  Such as?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, you know, why did this happen?  And why is -- you know,  considering that the New York Times had published an article today before,  which unfortunately hadn't gone in the print paper that I'm aware of about  Libya and how warlords are using it to target each other and selling on is  what Facebook et cetera.  You know, it just gives us the show how  absolutely unprepared they continue to be for the scale of abuse to their  platform.</p><p>And you know, you have to ask if it's happening there, what's still  happening here that we just don't know about yet.  The problem with this  platform is they're so abusable that there are essentially infinite ways to  gain their system and they have enormous distribution power.  And therefore  they become weaponized and they're trying desperately to deal with that and  I do admire and respect many of the gestures they're taking and the people  they've hired to try to step up to the problem but they have not yet fully  step up to the problem.  And I think it's very different from Twitter than  for Facebook though.</p><p>LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  You know, it's interesting you talked  about how unprepared they are for this.  I was sort of shocked that they  weren't grilled more on this subject of the actual panel which was the  security issue and foreign agents using their platforms.  So there's a lack  of scrutiny over the topic of the actual hearing suggest to you that  there's going to be zero asking from a congressional standpoint on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Probably you're right about that.  I would say that's very  good speculation.  You know, theoretically what we really were expecting  was keep probing about Russian manipulation in particular and what is being  put in place to prevent it from harming the election this fall.</p><p>We didn't really hear that in any great detail.  We heard a lot of -- in my  opinion fairly rode statements that have the same thing that have been said  in public before by Sheryl Sandberg.  And I think Jack Dorsey more candidly  and with a more humility acknowledge the Twitter really isn't yet doing  enough and to some extent doesn't even know what to do.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  The different thing, the two companies in my opinion, is that  Facebook desperately wants to convey the notion that they have this in  hand.  Jack doesn't have that arrogance.  He also doesn't have the money to  even make that claim because Twitter is so much less profitable and so much  smart.  But you know, in Mark Zuckerberg with Kara Swisher month or so ago,  he actually said the problem would be solved by the end of 2019 with  artificial intelligence.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Go back and check it out.  I mean, that just totally wrong  and really naive and dangerous.  Sheryl didn't say that exactly yesterday  but she really less -- you know, this thing it's on us that we want to  prepare to be as a very back candid way of accepting responsibility.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  He doesn't really say, oh my gosh, we are ashamed that we  built the platform that did not have sufficient controls and protections  against abuse.  We are desperately trying to fix it.  We don't fully know  how we need your help government outside civil society, please help us,  that what they should be saying.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  You know, I'm really glad you said that, David, because -- I  think I don't know about Pimm, but I know that when I was listening to the  testimony I found Jack Dorsey to be a lot more humble and thoughtful about  his answers and I thought Sheryl Sandberg was very practiced and very  polished but it felt like she was reading the script that she had been  giving or she drafted ahead of time.  And I feel like David, you're kind of  reiterating that feeling even though when we talked with the people  yesterday they thought that Sheryl Sandberg had done the better job and  certainly that seems to be what the stock action reflected.  What's your  view on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  You just restated exactly what I believe.  I think Sheryl is  a very-scripted, relatively insincere public speaker particularly at this  point.  I think much of the problem that happen on Facebook that have lead  to this manipulation and abuse of Facebook in the United States and  Germany, in Brexit and so many other instances really are a consequence of  the failure to build controls into the advertising system that she over  saw.</p><p>Therefore she is personally responsible for many of the thing that went  wrong.  And she essentially escaping any kind of real accounting for that  and nobody -- because that's unfortunately even though some have said  yesterday Senate question showed more intelligence and I thought Senator  Warner actually on Bloomberg bragging about how he thought that this  committee has smarter questions than the hearing when Zuckerberg was  testifying.  I really don't think that on balance the senators really  understand how the stuff all works and who is responsible.  And, you know,  what any of the mechanics are inside the company.  And that's partly  because Facebook has been consummately un-transparent.  I mean, they really  do not show any real humility, zero.  And that is a big difference with  Jack Dorsey.</p><p>FOX:  David Kirkpatrick --</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  They don't know what they're doing.</p><p>FOX:  OK.  Look into the future and we're going to continue the  conversation.  I just want you to look into the future for us, maybe 5,  maybe even a decade from now.  Do you believe that there will be government  regulations that in some way affect social media technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  100%.  I would say it's a lot less than 10 years.  We're  talking about two-year probably and it will be very fragmented global  regulatory environment that they're going to be getting regulation all over  the place where we're seeing that in Europe quite dramatically.  It's  happening.  It will happen here, totally.</p><p>FOX:  And maybe investors are already picking up on that because I just  looking at the trading in Facebook shares, they are down now heading for  the fifth consecutive trading session of losses, Facebook shares are now  lower on the year, they are down about six percent.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.  We're going to continue conversation with David  Kirkpatrick.  So stay where you are, because we can talk about Facebook.   Facebook is actually the one laggard among all of them that is down on the  air.  People talk about the same rally and how that's really driven stock  market.  Well, certainly Facebook has been entirely left out of that and  sort of interesting to see in question whether it's the sort of lack of  stability that David Kirkpatrick was talking about that perhaps lead into  that.</p><p>FOX:  Well compare to the performance of Twitter and not to say that the  stock performance is a proxy for whether the companies are going to be  regulator or not but Twitter shares they're up more than 30% this year,  compare that to Facebook, the shares as I said they are down about six in  quarter percent so far this year.</p><p>We've got much more with David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy and also the author  of the \"Facebook Effect\" talking about what happens when government  regulator make it very interested in your business.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FOX:  Our guest is David Kirkpatrick, he is the founder and the chief  executive of Techonomy.  He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>David, I'm going to have you put three Ph.D. dissertations into a very  short amount of time.  I want to get your thoughts on robotics artificial  intelligence and machine learning.  Are these are just buzz words or are we  going to have to learn more details about the companies that create this  kind of technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, those are huge, huge issues that are all deeply  connected.  Certainly, machine learning is a significant subset of  artificial intelligence and robotics is increasingly control by artificial  intelligence.</p><p>We are going to see these technologies and particularly A.I. in general  become a more and more central part of how systems work around everything  we do in our personal lives, in our work lives, in industrial circumstances  in government, everywhere it's just the direction that technology is  heading including even in the area we were discussing for social media  where it's -- you know A.I. is said to be the technology that will solve  the problem by some practitioners.  So yes, it's huge.  These are the  technologies to watch.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So what's the company -- which companies are the ones to watch  who are best sort of adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence  to practical applications and will be a commercial success who haven't  already been recognize?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, the interesting thing about that is it's not a  surprising answer.  There are a lot of small companies that are doing very  innovative thing in terms of the actual software but the key with A.I. to  make it successful is that scale of the dataset that you have to work with  which then you use to train \"machine learning\" which takes, you know,  continued passes over a decision making process with more and more and more  data and gets better and better.</p><p>So therefore the people who have the most data who are also working on A.I.  are the ones who will win and that basically limited to a very small group,  which is Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft to a lesser extend, Alibaba,  Tencent, Baidu, you know, there are companies that have a very good --  their main expertise in certain fields like Uber and self-driving and, you  know, delivery of humans and other things but in general I would say the  companies that are going to win on A.I. are Amazon, Facebook and Google  must of all.</p><p>FOX:  David Kirkpatrick, full disclosure I have the pressure of attending  one of your Techonomy sessions and I learned that companies such as SAPOracle, those people that are in the background of all of these databases  particularly for industrial applications they are also making Artificial  Intelligence in the mining of data a key stone of their strategy to help  their costumers.  Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Well, certainly and SAP is an example of a very large company  that also has access to an awful lot of data and they're working really  hard with A.I.  So it's not to say they aren't doing smart stuff.  It's  similarly salesforce.com, Oracle as you mentioned, IBM is of course a  company who is watching product for several years, kind of leading their  charge of image management and they are talking more about A.I. and lesson  about watching now but certainly IBM believes A.I. is key to a future.</p><p>You know, I wouldn't think it's over stating it to say every technology  company and consumer or enterprise oriented software and services  recognizes that A.I. is probably the central technology that will determine  whether they win or not.  It's how well do you deploy A.I. and A.I.  solutions, whether you're building yourself or you are buying it and  deploying it that was built by others.</p><p>One of the things that I think we probably will see going back to what I  said before about Amazon and other is that especially we get AmazonGoogle  and Microsoft all offer their own cloud hosting services, they will be able  to offer A.I. services as part of their cloud services to enterprise  customers and start aps and that is going to be a key differentiator that  they will use to try to compete with one another.  And again, Amazon, being  the largest has the biggest advantage thought.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  You know, I have to wonder as you talk, David, as you were  saying earlier about the big tech giants winning just simply due to the  scope of the data that they have.  Will this scrunch (ph) to innovation?   In other words, without democratization of that data and of that power,  that ability to try to come up with the best algorithms and the best  machine learning processes, are we going not get necessarily the best  ideas?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  No, in a sense it's the scale of these companies to begin  with that is at risk of scrunching innovation or concentrating it unfairly.   I think that -- this is I believe and I think goes to the hearing yesterday  and why it was somewhat disappointed (ph) them.</p><p>The few scale of Facebook, Google and Amazon in particular is such a new  development in society and so overwhelming the important from so many  aspects because there's -- the power they have to control economics  activity to gain insight into social and societal and even governmental  function to develop A.I.  So the A.I. piece is just one part of that but  yes, this companies had an unfair advantage because of the scale and, you  know, it's one the reason why Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world,  worth of $160 -- $170 billion, the market has recognize that.</p><p>But it's very intertwined set of issues that have super complicated.  It is  a big topic for us to Techonomy and I'm glad that Pimm mentioned what we're  doing here because we really think that the Techonomy host conference and  publishes stuff on our website, Techonomy.com, et cetera.</p><p>This whole issue of A.I. has impacted influence in long-term implications  and this is simultaneous of the scale of the small number of companies.   These are some of the biggest strategic questions that not only business  but society has rustled with.</p><p>FOX:  David Kirkpatrick, to get a little bit more in the weeds because  Amazon and the Amazon factor always in the background when it comes to any  kind of commercial enterprise now whether it's web services, you described  or retail and indeed even the healthcare initiative, what do you believe  will be the next industry to be disrupted by Amazon?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  One that I would be pretty seriously expecting is banking.   They've got -- and I would say, probably they've got their eyes on  insurance as well.  I mean, the healthcare thing is still very nascent but  they did hire a very immanent healthcare writer and research doctor to work  them and at JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a kind of overall sort  of employee oriented project to begin with --</p><p>FOX:  Right.  But do you think insurance and banking, the finance industry?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, look, think of how much banking  inspiration Amazon must already had given the scale of commerce that is  being concentrated through its platform.  You know, it's getting enormous  influence.  I mean, certainly it offers credit card services are at various  sorts and partnership with others now.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  And that's just the beginning.  You know, the economy is  going digital.  So the digital dominant companies are going to have an  advantage in almost every industry.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  But don't think want to avoid the regulation, the oversight  that comes along with paying a bank?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I mean, I think Amazon and Jeff Bezos is  -- this is one thing he does share with Elon Musk is fearlessness and a  willingness to confront unexpected, you know, obstacles and just sort of  power through.  I don't think that a fear of banking regulation would stop  Amazon what the insight that they really wanted to get into that.</p><p>I think what would stop and potentially is the fear of antitrust or some  kind of new regulatory oversight that they're disparate to avoid but again,  the conventional antitrust doesn't even really apply because Amazon  tacticals (ph) are in so many industry simultaneously that they're gaining  additional scale without actually dominating anyone industry.</p><p>I mean, they do dominate online retails so that we could say, if you design  as an industry and itself but it isn't retail, it's just the online portion  of retail.  So I don't think they wouldn't a treat to banks of the outset.   It would be after they'd taken advantage of all their other scale  advantages that they begin to post a threat.</p><p>It's also, think about the fact in their healthcare they are partnering  with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>FOX:  Indeed.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK:  Right?  What about that?</p><p>FOX:  Yes, never of the information that they can put together with the  joint venture with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Much appreciated, David Kirkpatrick, he is the Chief Executive and the  Founder of Techonomy, also the author of the book, the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Our next guest is David Kirkpatrick.  He is  the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy.  He is also the author of  the \"Facebook Effect\" and we want to find out what the congressional effect  of yesterday's testimony of Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg for  Facebook as well as Jack Dorsey the Chief Executive of Twitter may have had  on investor's appetite for both of these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> David, what did you make of their presentation before Congress and what do  you think investor ought to take away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAVID KIRKPATRICK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND FOUNDER OF TECHONOMY MEDIA:   Well, thanks Pimm.  I wasn't -- well, you know, it's a different thing for  each company.  And I think that Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg take a  quite different view of the whole thing.  I think the company has came out  of it well, in the sense I would call the more or less on this case and  that's partly because with Google not showing up a lot of heat was taken  off them and put on Google simply for its failure to show.</p><p> I also think they were more or less stared the toughest question that might  have hope they would asked.</p><p> FOX:  Such as?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Well, you know, why did this happen?  And why is -- you know,  considering that the New York Times had published an article today before,  which unfortunately hadn't gone in the print paper that I'm aware of about  Libya and how warlords are using it to target each other and selling on is  what Facebook et cetera.  You know, it just gives us the show how  absolutely unprepared they continue to be for the scale of abuse to their  platform.</p><p> And you know, you have to ask if it's happening there, what's still  happening here that we just don't know about yet.  The problem with this  platform is they're so abusable that there are essentially infinite ways to  gain their system and they have enormous distribution power.  And therefore  they become weaponized and they're trying desperately to deal with that and  I do admire and respect many of the gestures they're taking and the people  they've hired to try to step up to the problem but they have not yet fully  step up to the problem.  And I think it's very different from Twitter than  for Facebook though.</p><p> LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  You know, it's interesting you talked  about how unprepared they are for this.  I was sort of shocked that they  weren't grilled more on this subject of the actual panel which was the  security issue and foreign agents using their platforms.  So there's a lack  of scrutiny over the topic of the actual hearing suggest to you that  there's going to be zero asking from a congressional standpoint on that?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Probably you're right about that.  I would say that's very  good speculation.  You know, theoretically what we really were expecting  was keep probing about Russian manipulation in particular and what is being  put in place to prevent it from harming the election this fall.</p><p> We didn't really hear that in any great detail.  We heard a lot of -- in my  opinion fairly rode statements that have the same thing that have been said  in public before by Sheryl Sandberg.  And I think Jack Dorsey more candidly  and with a more humility acknowledge the Twitter really isn't yet doing  enough and to some extent doesn't even know what to do.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  The different thing, the two companies in my opinion, is that  Facebook desperately wants to convey the notion that they have this in  hand.  Jack doesn't have that arrogance.  He also doesn't have the money to  even make that claim because Twitter is so much less profitable and so much  smart.  But you know, in Mark Zuckerberg with Kara Swisher month or so ago,  he actually said the problem would be solved by the end of 2019 with  artificial intelligence.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Go back and check it out.  I mean, that just totally wrong  and really naive and dangerous.  Sheryl didn't say that exactly yesterday  but she really less -- you know, this thing it's on us that we want to  prepare to be as a very back candid way of accepting responsibility.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  He doesn't really say, oh my gosh, we are ashamed that we  built the platform that did not have sufficient controls and protections  against abuse.  We are desperately trying to fix it.  We don't fully know  how we need your help government outside civil society, please help us,  that what they should be saying.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  You know, I'm really glad you said that, David, because -- I  think I don't know about Pimm, but I know that when I was listening to the  testimony I found Jack Dorsey to be a lot more humble and thoughtful about  his answers and I thought Sheryl Sandberg was very practiced and very  polished but it felt like she was reading the script that she had been  giving or she drafted ahead of time.  And I feel like David, you're kind of  reiterating that feeling even though when we talked with the people  yesterday they thought that Sheryl Sandberg had done the better job and  certainly that seems to be what the stock action reflected.  What's your  view on that?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  You just restated exactly what I believe.  I think Sheryl is  a very-scripted, relatively insincere public speaker particularly at this  point.  I think much of the problem that happen on Facebook that have lead  to this manipulation and abuse of Facebook in the United States and  Germany, in Brexit and so many other instances really are a consequence of  the failure to build controls into the advertising system that she over  saw.</p><p> Therefore she is personally responsible for many of the thing that went  wrong.  And she essentially escaping any kind of real accounting for that  and nobody -- because that's unfortunately even though some have said  yesterday Senate question showed more intelligence and I thought Senator  Warner actually on Bloomberg bragging about how he thought that this  committee has smarter questions than the hearing when Zuckerberg was  testifying.  I really don't think that on balance the senators really  understand how the stuff all works and who is responsible.  And, you know,  what any of the mechanics are inside the company.  And that's partly  because Facebook has been consummately un-transparent.  I mean, they really  do not show any real humility, zero.  And that is a big difference with  Jack Dorsey.</p><p> FOX:  David Kirkpatrick --</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  They don't know what they're doing.</p><p> FOX:  OK.  Look into the future and we're going to continue the  conversation.  I just want you to look into the future for us, maybe 5,  maybe even a decade from now.  Do you believe that there will be government  regulations that in some way affect social media technology?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  100%.  I would say it's a lot less than 10 years.  We're  talking about two-year probably and it will be very fragmented global  regulatory environment that they're going to be getting regulation all over  the place where we're seeing that in Europe quite dramatically.  It's  happening.  It will happen here, totally.</p><p> FOX:  And maybe investors are already picking up on that because I just  looking at the trading in Facebook shares, they are down now heading for  the fifth consecutive trading session of losses, Facebook shares are now  lower on the year, they are down about six percent.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.  We're going to continue conversation with David  Kirkpatrick.  So stay where you are, because we can talk about Facebook.   Facebook is actually the one laggard among all of them that is down on the  air.  People talk about the same rally and how that's really driven stock  market.  Well, certainly Facebook has been entirely left out of that and  sort of interesting to see in question whether it's the sort of lack of  stability that David Kirkpatrick was talking about that perhaps lead into  that.</p><p> FOX:  Well compare to the performance of Twitter and not to say that the  stock performance is a proxy for whether the companies are going to be  regulator or not but Twitter shares they're up more than 30% this year,  compare that to Facebook, the shares as I said they are down about six in  quarter percent so far this year.</p><p> We've got much more with David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy and also the author  of the \"Facebook Effect\" talking about what happens when government  regulator make it very interested in your business.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FOX:  Our guest is David Kirkpatrick, he is the founder and the chief  executive of Techonomy.  He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p> David, I'm going to have you put three Ph.D. dissertations into a very  short amount of time.  I want to get your thoughts on robotics artificial  intelligence and machine learning.  Are these are just buzz words or are we  going to have to learn more details about the companies that create this  kind of technology?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Well, those are huge, huge issues that are all deeply  connected.  Certainly, machine learning is a significant subset of  artificial intelligence and robotics is increasingly control by artificial  intelligence.</p><p> We are going to see these technologies and particularly A.I. in general  become a more and more central part of how systems work around everything  we do in our personal lives, in our work lives, in industrial circumstances  in government, everywhere it's just the direction that technology is  heading including even in the area we were discussing for social media  where it's -- you know A.I. is said to be the technology that will solve  the problem by some practitioners.  So yes, it's huge.  These are the  technologies to watch.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  So what's the company -- which companies are the ones to watch  who are best sort of adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence  to practical applications and will be a commercial success who haven't  already been recognize?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Well, the interesting thing about that is it's not a  surprising answer.  There are a lot of small companies that are doing very  innovative thing in terms of the actual software but the key with A.I. to  make it successful is that scale of the dataset that you have to work with  which then you use to train \"machine learning\" which takes, you know,  continued passes over a decision making process with more and more and more  data and gets better and better.</p><p> So therefore the people who have the most data who are also working on A.I.  are the ones who will win and that basically limited to a very small group,  which is Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft to a lesser extend, Alibaba,  Tencent, Baidu, you know, there are companies that have a very good --  their main expertise in certain fields like Uber and self-driving and, you  know, delivery of humans and other things but in general I would say the  companies that are going to win on A.I. are Amazon, Facebook and Google  must of all.</p><p> FOX:  David Kirkpatrick, full disclosure I have the pressure of attending  one of your Techonomy sessions and I learned that companies such as SAP  Oracle, those people that are in the background of all of these databases  particularly for industrial applications they are also making Artificial  Intelligence in the mining of data a key stone of their strategy to help  their costumers.  Can you elaborate on that?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Well, certainly and SAP is an example of a very large company  that also has access to an awful lot of data and they're working really  hard with A.I.  So it's not to say they aren't doing smart stuff.  It's  similarly salesforce.com, Oracle as you mentioned, IBM is of course a  company who is watching product for several years, kind of leading their  charge of image management and they are talking more about A.I. and lesson  about watching now but certainly IBM believes A.I. is key to a future.</p><p> You know, I wouldn't think it's over stating it to say every technology  company and consumer or enterprise oriented software and services  recognizes that A.I. is probably the central technology that will determine  whether they win or not.  It's how well do you deploy A.I. and A.I.  solutions, whether you're building yourself or you are buying it and  deploying it that was built by others.</p><p> One of the things that I think we probably will see going back to what I  said before about Amazon and other is that especially we get Amazon Google  and Microsoft all offer their own cloud hosting services, they will be able  to offer A.I. services as part of their cloud services to enterprise  customers and start aps and that is going to be a key differentiator that  they will use to try to compete with one another.  And again, Amazon, being  the largest has the biggest advantage thought.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  You know, I have to wonder as you talk, David, as you were  saying earlier about the big tech giants winning just simply due to the  scope of the data that they have.  Will this scrunch (ph) to innovation?   In other words, without democratization of that data and of that power,  that ability to try to come up with the best algorithms and the best  machine learning processes, are we going not get necessarily the best  ideas?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  No, in a sense it's the scale of these companies to begin  with that is at risk of scrunching innovation or concentrating it unfairly.   I think that -- this is I believe and I think goes to the hearing yesterday  and why it was somewhat disappointed (ph) them.</p><p> The few scale of Facebook, Google and Amazon in particular is such a new  development in society and so overwhelming the important from so many  aspects because there's -- the power they have to control economics  activity to gain insight into social and societal and even governmental  function to develop A.I.  So the A.I. piece is just one part of that but  yes, this companies had an unfair advantage because of the scale and, you  know, it's one the reason why Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world,  worth of $160 -- $170 billion, the market has recognize that.</p><p> But it's very intertwined set of issues that have super complicated.  It is  a big topic for us to Techonomy and I'm glad that Pimm mentioned what we're  doing here because we really think that the Techonomy host conference and  publishes stuff on our website, Techonomy.com, et cetera.</p><p> This whole issue of A.I. has impacted influence in long-term implications  and this is simultaneous of the scale of the small number of companies.   These are some of the biggest strategic questions that not only business  but society has rustled with.</p><p> FOX:  David Kirkpatrick, to get a little bit more in the weeds because  Amazon and the Amazon factor always in the background when it comes to any  kind of commercial enterprise now whether it's web services, you described  or retail and indeed even the healthcare initiative, what do you believe  will be the next industry to be disrupted by Amazon?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  One that I would be pretty seriously expecting is banking.   They've got -- and I would say, probably they've got their eyes on  insurance as well.  I mean, the healthcare thing is still very nascent but  they did hire a very immanent healthcare writer and research doctor to work  them and at JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a kind of overall sort  of employee oriented project to begin with --</p><p> FOX:  Right.  But do you think insurance and banking, the finance industry?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, look, think of how much banking  inspiration Amazon must already had given the scale of commerce that is  being concentrated through its platform.  You know, it's getting enormous  influence.  I mean, certainly it offers credit card services are at various  sorts and partnership with others now.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Yes.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  And that's just the beginning.  You know, the economy is  going digital.  So the digital dominant companies are going to have an  advantage in almost every industry.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  But don't think want to avoid the regulation, the oversight  that comes along with paying a bank?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I mean, I think Amazon and Jeff Bezos is  -- this is one thing he does share with Elon Musk is fearlessness and a  willingness to confront unexpected, you know, obstacles and just sort of  power through.  I don't think that a fear of banking regulation would stop  Amazon what the insight that they really wanted to get into that.</p><p> I think what would stop and potentially is the fear of antitrust or some  kind of new regulatory oversight that they're disparate to avoid but again,  the conventional antitrust doesn't even really apply because Amazon  tacticals (ph) are in so many industry simultaneously that they're gaining  additional scale without actually dominating anyone industry.</p><p> I mean, they do dominate online retails so that we could say, if you design  as an industry and itself but it isn't retail, it's just the online portion  of retail.  So I don't think they wouldn't a treat to banks of the outset.   It would be after they'd taken advantage of all their other scale  advantages that they begin to post a threat.</p><p> It's also, think about the fact in their healthcare they are partnering  with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p> FOX:  Indeed.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK:  Right?  What about that?</p><p> FOX:  Yes, never of the information that they can put together with the  joint venture with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p> Much appreciated, David Kirkpatrick, he is the Chief Executive and the  Founder of Techonomy, also the author of the book, the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PIMM FOX, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Our next guest is David Kirkpatrick. He is the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" and we want to find out what the congressional effect of yesterday's testimony of Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg for Facebook as well as Jack Dorsey the Chief Executive of Twitter may have had on investor's appetite for both of these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David, what did you make of their presentation before Congress and what do you think investor ought to take away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID KIRKPATRICK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND FOUNDER OF TECHONOMY MEDIA: Well, thanks Pimm. I wasn't -- well, you know, it's a different thing for each company. And I think that Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg take a quite different view of the whole thing. I think the company has came out of it well, in the sense I would call the more or less on this case and that's partly because with Google not showing up a lot of heat was taken off them and put on Google simply for its failure to show.</p><p>I also think they were more or less stared the toughest question that might have hope they would asked.</p><p>FOX: Such as?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, you know, why did this happen? And why is -- you know, considering that the New York Times had published an article today before, which unfortunately hadn't gone in the print paper that I'm aware of about Libya and how warlords are using it to target each other and selling on is what Facebook et cetera. You know, it just gives us the show how absolutely unprepared they continue to be for the scale of abuse to their platform.</p><p>And you know, you have to ask if it's happening there, what's still happening here that we just don't know about yet. The problem with this platform is they're so abusable that there are essentially infinite ways to gain their system and they have enormous distribution power. And therefore they become weaponized and they're trying desperately to deal with that and I do admire and respect many of the gestures they're taking and the people they've hired to try to step up to the problem but they have not yet fully step up to the problem. And I think it's very different from Twitter than for Facebook though.</p><p>LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: You know, it's interesting you talked about how unprepared they are for this. I was sort of shocked that they weren't grilled more on this subject of the actual panel which was the security issue and foreign agents using their platforms. So there's a lack of scrutiny over the topic of the actual hearing suggest to you that there's going to be zero asking from a congressional standpoint on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Probably you're right about that. I would say that's very good speculation. You know, theoretically what we really were expecting was keep probing about Russian manipulation in particular and what is being put in place to prevent it from harming the election this fall.</p><p>We didn't really hear that in any great detail. We heard a lot of -- in my opinion fairly rode statements that have the same thing that have been said in public before by Sheryl Sandberg. And I think Jack Dorsey more candidly and with a more humility acknowledge the Twitter really isn't yet doing enough and to some extent doesn't even know what to do.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: The different thing, the two companies in my opinion, is that Facebook desperately wants to convey the notion that they have this in hand. Jack doesn't have that arrogance. He also doesn't have the money to even make that claim because Twitter is so much less profitable and so much smart. But you know, in Mark Zuckerberg with Kara Swisher month or so ago, he actually said the problem would be solved by the end of 2019 with artificial intelligence.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Go back and check it out. I mean, that just totally wrong and really naive and dangerous. Sheryl didn't say that exactly yesterday but she really less -- you know, this thing it's on us that we want to prepare to be as a very back candid way of accepting responsibility.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He doesn't really say, oh my gosh, we are ashamed that we built the platform that did not have sufficient controls and protections against abuse. We are desperately trying to fix it. We don't fully know how we need your help government outside civil society, please help us, that what they should be saying.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I'm really glad you said that, David, because -- I think I don't know about Pimm, but I know that when I was listening to the testimony I found Jack Dorsey to be a lot more humble and thoughtful about his answers and I thought Sheryl Sandberg was very practiced and very polished but it felt like she was reading the script that she had been giving or she drafted ahead of time. And I feel like David, you're kind of reiterating that feeling even though when we talked with the people yesterday they thought that Sheryl Sandberg had done the better job and certainly that seems to be what the stock action reflected. What's your view on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You just restated exactly what I believe. I think Sheryl is a very-scripted, relatively insincere public speaker particularly at this point. I think much of the problem that happen on Facebook that have lead to this manipulation and abuse of Facebook in the United States and Germany, in Brexit and so many other instances really are a consequence of the failure to build controls into the advertising system that she over saw.</p><p>Therefore she is personally responsible for many of the thing that went wrong. And she essentially escaping any kind of real accounting for that and nobody -- because that's unfortunately even though some have said yesterday Senate question showed more intelligence and I thought Senator Warner actually on Bloomberg bragging about how he thought that this committee has smarter questions than the hearing when Zuckerberg was testifying. I really don't think that on balance the senators really understand how the stuff all works and who is responsible. And, you know, what any of the mechanics are inside the company. And that's partly because Facebook has been consummately un-transparent. I mean, they really do not show any real humility, zero. And that is a big difference with Jack Dorsey.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick --</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: They don't know what they're doing.</p><p>FOX: OK. Look into the future and we're going to continue the conversation. I just want you to look into the future for us, maybe 5, maybe even a decade from now. Do you believe that there will be government regulations that in some way affect social media technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: 100%. I would say it's a lot less than 10 years. We're talking about two-year probably and it will be very fragmented global regulatory environment that they're going to be getting regulation all over the place where we're seeing that in Europe quite dramatically. It's happening. It will happen here, totally.</p><p>FOX: And maybe investors are already picking up on that because I just looking at the trading in Facebook shares, they are down now heading for the fifth consecutive trading session of losses, Facebook shares are now lower on the year, they are down about six percent.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes. We're going to continue conversation with David Kirkpatrick. So stay where you are, because we can talk about Facebook. Facebook is actually the one laggard among all of them that is down on the air. People talk about the same rally and how that's really driven stock market. Well, certainly Facebook has been entirely left out of that and sort of interesting to see in question whether it's the sort of lack of stability that David Kirkpatrick was talking about that perhaps lead into that.</p><p>FOX: Well compare to the performance of Twitter and not to say that the stock performance is a proxy for whether the companies are going to be regulator or not but Twitter shares they're up more than 30% this year, compare that to Facebook, the shares as I said they are down about six in quarter percent so far this year.</p><p>We've got much more with David Kirkpatrick of Techonomy and also the author of the \"Facebook Effect\" talking about what happens when government regulator make it very interested in your business.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FOX: Our guest is David Kirkpatrick, he is the founder and the chief executive of Techonomy. He is also the author of the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>David, I'm going to have you put three Ph.D. dissertations into a very short amount of time. I want to get your thoughts on robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning. Are these are just buzz words or are we going to have to learn more details about the companies that create this kind of technology?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, those are huge, huge issues that are all deeply connected. Certainly, machine learning is a significant subset of artificial intelligence and robotics is increasingly control by artificial intelligence.</p><p>We are going to see these technologies and particularly A.I. in general become a more and more central part of how systems work around everything we do in our personal lives, in our work lives, in industrial circumstances in government, everywhere it's just the direction that technology is heading including even in the area we were discussing for social media where it's -- you know A.I. is said to be the technology that will solve the problem by some practitioners. So yes, it's huge. These are the technologies to watch.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: So what's the company -- which companies are the ones to watch who are best sort of adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence to practical applications and will be a commercial success who haven't already been recognize?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, the interesting thing about that is it's not a surprising answer. There are a lot of small companies that are doing very innovative thing in terms of the actual software but the key with A.I. to make it successful is that scale of the dataset that you have to work with which then you use to train \"machine learning\" which takes, you know, continued passes over a decision making process with more and more and more data and gets better and better.</p><p>So therefore the people who have the most data who are also working on A.I. are the ones who will win and that basically limited to a very small group, which is Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft to a lesser extend, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, you know, there are companies that have a very good -- their main expertise in certain fields like Uber and self-driving and, you know, delivery of humans and other things but in general I would say the companies that are going to win on A.I. are Amazon, Facebook and Google must of all.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick, full disclosure I have the pressure of attending one of your Techonomy sessions and I learned that companies such as SAP Oracle, those people that are in the background of all of these databases particularly for industrial applications they are also making Artificial Intelligence in the mining of data a key stone of their strategy to help their costumers. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well, certainly and SAP is an example of a very large company that also has access to an awful lot of data and they're working really hard with A.I. So it's not to say they aren't doing smart stuff. It's similarly salesforce.com, Oracle as you mentioned, IBM is of course a company who is watching product for several years, kind of leading their charge of image management and they are talking more about A.I. and lesson about watching now but certainly IBM believes A.I. is key to a future.</p><p>You know, I wouldn't think it's over stating it to say every technology company and consumer or enterprise oriented software and services recognizes that A.I. is probably the central technology that will determine whether they win or not. It's how well do you deploy A.I. and A.I. solutions, whether you're building yourself or you are buying it and deploying it that was built by others.</p><p>One of the things that I think we probably will see going back to what I said before about Amazon and other is that especially we get Amazon Google and Microsoft all offer their own cloud hosting services, they will be able to offer A.I. services as part of their cloud services to enterprise customers and start aps and that is going to be a key differentiator that they will use to try to compete with one another. And again, Amazon, being the largest has the biggest advantage thought.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: You know, I have to wonder as you talk, David, as you were saying earlier about the big tech giants winning just simply due to the scope of the data that they have. Will this scrunch (ph) to innovation? In other words, without democratization of that data and of that power, that ability to try to come up with the best algorithms and the best machine learning processes, are we going not get necessarily the best ideas?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No, in a sense it's the scale of these companies to begin with that is at risk of scrunching innovation or concentrating it unfairly. I think that -- this is I believe and I think goes to the hearing yesterday and why it was somewhat disappointed (ph) them.</p><p>The few scale of Facebook, Google and Amazon in particular is such a new development in society and so overwhelming the important from so many aspects because there's -- the power they have to control economics activity to gain insight into social and societal and even governmental function to develop A.I. So the A.I. piece is just one part of that but yes, this companies had an unfair advantage because of the scale and, you know, it's one the reason why Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, worth of $160 -- $170 billion, the market has recognize that.</p><p>But it's very intertwined set of issues that have super complicated. It is a big topic for us to Techonomy and I'm glad that Pimm mentioned what we're doing here because we really think that the Techonomy host conference and publishes stuff on our website, Techonomy.com, et cetera.</p><p>This whole issue of A.I. has impacted influence in long-term implications and this is simultaneous of the scale of the small number of companies. These are some of the biggest strategic questions that not only business but society has rustled with.</p><p>FOX: David Kirkpatrick, to get a little bit more in the weeds because Amazon and the Amazon factor always in the background when it comes to any kind of commercial enterprise now whether it's web services, you described or retail and indeed even the healthcare initiative, what do you believe will be the next industry to be disrupted by Amazon?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: One that I would be pretty seriously expecting is banking. They've got -- and I would say, probably they've got their eyes on insurance as well. I mean, the healthcare thing is still very nascent but they did hire a very immanent healthcare writer and research doctor to work them and at JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a kind of overall sort of employee oriented project to begin with --</p><p>FOX: Right. But do you think insurance and banking, the finance industry?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Oh, yeah. I mean, look, think of how much banking inspiration Amazon must already had given the scale of commerce that is being concentrated through its platform. You know, it's getting enormous influence. I mean, certainly it offers credit card services are at various sorts and partnership with others now.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And that's just the beginning. You know, the economy is going digital. So the digital dominant companies are going to have an advantage in almost every industry.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: But don't think want to avoid the regulation, the oversight that comes along with paying a bank?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Maybe. Maybe not. I mean, I think Amazon and Jeff Bezos is -- this is one thing he does share with Elon Musk is fearlessness and a willingness to confront unexpected, you know, obstacles and just sort of power through. I don't think that a fear of banking regulation would stop Amazon what the insight that they really wanted to get into that.</p><p>I think what would stop and potentially is the fear of antitrust or some kind of new regulatory oversight that they're disparate to avoid but again, the conventional antitrust doesn't even really apply because Amazon tacticals (ph) are in so many industry simultaneously that they're gaining additional scale without actually dominating anyone industry.</p><p>I mean, they do dominate online retails so that we could say, if you design as an industry and itself but it isn't retail, it's just the online portion of retail. So I don't think they wouldn't a treat to banks of the outset. It would be after they'd taken advantage of all their other scale advantages that they begin to post a threat.</p><p>It's also, think about the fact in their healthcare they are partnering with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>FOX: Indeed.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Right? What about that?</p><p>FOX: Yes, never of the information that they can put together with the joint venture with JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>Much appreciated, David Kirkpatrick, he is the Chief Executive and the Founder of Techonomy, also the author of the book, the \"Facebook Effect.\"</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Guys, great to have you with me around the table.  </p><p>      David, let's begin with you. What are you telling clients about the situation as it unfolds and is it something that we should be worried about?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Well it's clearly an issue. It's clear risk to margins and in the cost. So the message we've been discussing with clients has been focused on some of the fundamentals that are more domestically facing. And so, let's look at financials which is an area that is most affected by deregulation and some lower taxes and the upcoming CCAR results which are likely to be really sometime in late June. So that's one area to focus on.  </p><p>      And then, focus on companies that are driving their top line sales and the argument behind that is it's less affected by some of the higher input costs that are likely to emanate as a result of the some of the tariffs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  There are two points there, let's deal with the first one.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  On the financials, it feels like a shifted domestic kind of story and away from international Gina, are you hearing much more of that thing as well?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADAMS</emphasis>:  Oh absolutely and I think it's playing out on the data with small have index making new highs. The micro caps continuing to make new highs. The S&amp;P is sort of frustratingly stuck in this range. And part of the reason probably is because the dollar is rallying and marks or to some non-domestic risks.  </p><p>      I think really interestingly, you've got this really strong rally in small-cap financials does not being confirmed in the large cap financials. Does that ultimately mean that large cap needs to catch up? They are pretty domestically focused as well or does large cap continue to live because they do have a decent amount of exposure overseas. They do have flow top line growth --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARTIN ADAMS</emphasis>:  -- as opposed to some of the other components in the index and where can we get that big (move) in large caps financial that's a big question mark for them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  So you've seen some small-cap banks that had loan growth now running up almost 8 percent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARTIN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  --from the data, which is just one of the key drivers. As well as the ability companies return cash to share this to dividends and buybacks and we hear that in about within the month, by the end of June. We're expecting something in the vicinity of 20 percent incremental dividends and buybacks that will be a key driver. And that will effects of small caps as you indicated as well as large caps.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MALE</emphasis>:  Just to jump in, very quickly and bring you some comments from the President of the United States, Donald Trump speaks right now. Let's take and listen.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  The President of the United States there discussing an upcoming meeting potentially with the North Korean leader that could happen at some point potentially in the next month or so. And just another brick in a wall of worries, David Kostin, not just trade, the foreign policy as well, usually, we climb that wall of worry.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  And the last week or so been battering into it like this, why?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Well, the answer there is now variety of outcomes that may or they may or made in that environment, whether the shift is what's happening with corporate earnings and some of the fundamentals?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  What are companies doing? You see CEO confidence remains very high. Consumer confidence 77 percent economy also indicating it's high levels, one of the highest in the number of years, small business optimism also very high.  </p><p>      So all these indications of confidence are more fundamentally rooted, so there's a lot of geopolitical issues clearly a risk out there. Not clear how you want to invest along that basis.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  So one fundamental question I guess for you that you've been exploring, David, is whether earnings expansion can offset evaluation contraction. Candid, what's the base case for Goldman?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  I think the base case is you have earnings growth, which is led by economic expansion. But you don't get an evaluation increase. And so we have a evaluation that's high, where somewhere in the 80th, 90th percentile spending on a day of historical evaluations or a high level of equity evaluations.  </p><p>      And so it's really earnings driven looking at the 2019, we really can't look at 2018 because you had this big tailwind from tax lifting the level of profits. And so with the growth rate and profits is really looking into 2019 and looking around probably five percent is the trajectory of growth. That's the type of return we are looking at in the next -- from now to the end of the year.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  And, David, that was the one with other concerns, it was rates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Right  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  And for you guys, is the danger zone still the four percent, we're someway of it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  I think got two issues, speed and level.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Speed, we're looking at something as a tipping point vicinity 20 to 30 basis point increase in 10 year bond yields within a month. That swiftness of an increase in rates would be of concern in the equity market. Lower, more gentle rise, a lower speed of increase would be less concerning. And from a level point of view, it's something in the vicinity of 375 to four percent on 10 year US treasury yields that would be a build head wind for equity returns.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  David, just a final word on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Well, when you think about where you find the earnings growth, the fastest revenue growth which is driving earnings growth, those companies have definitely been outperforming, that's a place to focus on. And it's interesting those are stocks that mutual fund financers are underweight.  </p><p>      Some of the large cap glamour stocks, think about Amazon, Apple, think of Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are underweight in portfolios, despite the fact that expectation is something in the vicinity of 20 plus percent revenue growth which is five times faster than the rest of the market and you have margins that are twice as high and financer actually underweight this visions despite that the dynamic.   </p><p>      It's a way to combat the idea of -- in our forecast is that you have higher bond yields as you need to have better revenue growth and earning growth.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  David Kostin, of Goldman Sachs, would you please decide it's going to be sticking with us along George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Gina Martin Adams, our Bloomberg Intelligence.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  And still with me, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg Intelligence.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Flows and flows, with the story of last year that explain the effects dynamic. Euro dollar picking up, people wanted to buy Europe, EM picking up people want to do by EM. David, we touched on this and I want to build on it with you. You guys have been looking at a basket of stocks that have high revenue growth in the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  The Goldman basket which has performed really, really well, and I just wonder whether that's going to develop to be a bigger theme this year. Forget about Euro, forget about (EM) there is some really good growth here in the United States.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  So you definitely have better growth, it's more durable, it's more visible. And from a corporate perspective, if you are worried about and we're concerned about higher input cost potentially, from a labor point view, from a capital perspective in terms of higher interest rates, and a materials perspective, in terms of tariffs potential can potentially imposed, all of those are pressures on margins.   </p><p>      And so, the only combatant you have against that is sales growth. Where are the companies with the best revenue growth? That's the intuition behind focusing on these companies and they're across every -- within every sector, those are the companies that are is comprised of those the companies that have the best top line sales  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MALE</emphasis>:  And was it --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  Was a Bloomberg ticker and you can pull up people trade it.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  If you listen to a program like this over the last year, you would think that tech was really crowded, a big consensus trade and whenever it gets on this program, just so have you understand, typically my producers asked them, what is your contrarian trade? What is your added consensus called?   </p><p>      And David Kostin replies were relative to what and record to mutual funds, to your point, somebody is big tech mantis (ph) contrarian. Walk me through that because to some of our view is that's going to stand quite foreign.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  So the, I call glamour stocks, your Amazon, your Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, those companies, the perception is everyone owns those stocks. And that is not supported by the data.   </p><p>      We look through almost to $2 trillion of holdings, the individual funds, compared within their different benchmarks, core growth value, they are those fundamentals are generally underweight those facts, persistently, consistently.  </p><p>      And that is in here that was indicating. We found at odds with the fact that such significant premium growth in revenues, and you have much higher margins. And that would be in my view supportive of to do that performance of some of those companies.   </p><p>      And why that's the case is a perception that they are -- everyone owns them. And be they're concerned about potential deregulation or regulation and some of the --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOSTIN</emphasis>:  -- monopolistic discussion that takes place in regulations in Washington or Europe, so those of you at risks, but the driving revenues is I think about the key.  </p><p>      So that's the first observation is where have viewed it's a different or variant from consensus and on the hedge fund side -- hedge fund have a very small position in finances. They have a less than 10 percent of the net exposure, when you net out the gross and along the shores, about 10 percent, as about 15 percent index.  </p><p>      Obviously, a hedge fund is not a benchmark oriented they are total return oriented. And we see what's catalyst in this market where it's been sort of chopping, move around side ways. You have in the next three weeks, you have the CCAR results. The stress test results and the fed will be, in our view likely to be approving, authorizing a return of dividends and buybacks for the next 12 months and increase about 20 percent.  </p><p>      And that is we saw that last year. Trading environment, when you had the CCAR results came out, bank stocks rallied significantly on the back of a significant increase in the planned capital return holders, and that I think is a catalyst. So we are divergent from consensus or the broad view on the hedge fund side and on the mutual fund side  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  David Kostin great to catch up with up, with Goldman Sachs. So let's stay longer with this next time, I know you're going to go. David Kostin, great to have you with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SG0-79G1-JDPT-T3NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Guys, great to have you  with me around the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> David, let's begin with you.  What are you telling clients about the  situation as it unfolds and is it something that we should be worried  about?</p><p> DAVID KOSTIN, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS:   Well it's  clearly an issue.  It's clear risk to margins and in the cost.  So the  message we've been discussing with clients has been focused on some of the  fundamentals that are more domestically facing.  And so, let's look at  financials which is an area that is most affected by deregulation and some  lower taxes and the upcoming CCAR results which are likely to be really  sometime in late June.  So that's one area to focus on.</p><p> And then, focus on companies that are driving their top line sales and the  argument behind that is it's less affected by some of the higher input  costs that are likely to emanate as a result of the some of the tariffs.</p><p> FERRO:  There are two points there, let's deal with the first one.</p><p> KOSTIN:  OK.</p><p> FERRO:  On the financials, it feels like a shifted domestic kind of story  and away from international Gina, are you hearing much more of that thing  as well?</p><p> GINA MARTIN ADAMS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Oh absolutely and I think it's  playing out on the data with small have index making new highs.  The micro  caps continuing to make new highs.  The S&amp;P is sort of frustratingly stuck  in this range.  And part of the reason probably is because the dollar is  rallying and marks or to some non-domestic risks.</p><p> I think really interestingly, you've got this really strong rally in small- cap financials does not being confirmed in the large cap financials.  Does  that ultimately mean that large cap needs to catch up?   They are pretty  domestically focused as well or does large cap continue to live because  they do have a decent amount of exposure overseas.  They do have flow top  line growth --</p><p> FERRO:  Yes.</p><p> MARTIN ADAMS:  -- as opposed to some of the other components in the index  and where can we get that big (move) in large caps financial that's a big  question mark for them.</p><p> KOSTIN:  So you've seen some small-cap banks that had loan growth now  running up almost 8 percent?</p><p> MARTIN:  Right.</p><p> KOSTIN:  --from the data, which is just one of the key drivers. As well as  the ability companies return cash to share this to dividends and buybacks  and we hear that in about within the month, by the end of June.  We're  expecting something in the vicinity of 20 percent incremental dividends and  buybacks that will be a key driver.  And that will effects of small caps as  you indicated as well as large caps.</p><p> MALE:  Just to jump in, very quickly and bring you some comments from the  President of the United States, Donald Trump speaks right now.  Let's take  and listen.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  The President of the United States there discussing an upcoming  meeting potentially with the North Korean leader that could happen at some  point potentially in the next month or so.  And just another brick in a  wall of worries, David Kostin, not just trade, the foreign policy as well,  usually, we climb that wall of worry.</p><p> KOSTIN:  Right.</p><p> FERRO:  And the last week or so been battering into it like this, why?</p><p> KOSTIN:  Well, the answer there is now variety of outcomes that may or they  may or made in that environment, whether the shift is what's happening with  corporate earnings and some of the fundamentals?</p><p> FERRO:  Yes.</p><p> KOSTIN:  What are companies doing?  You see CEO confidence remains very  high.  Consumer confidence 77 percent economy also indicating it's high  levels, one of the highest in the number of years, small business optimism  also very high.</p><p> So all these indications of confidence are more fundamentally rooted, so  there's a lot of geopolitical issues clearly a risk out there.  Not clear  how you want to invest along that basis.</p><p> FERRO:  So one fundamental question I guess for you that you've been  exploring, David, is whether earnings expansion can offset evaluation  contraction.  Candid, what's the base case for Goldman?</p><p> KOSTIN:  I think the base case is you have earnings growth, which is led by  economic expansion.  But you don't get an evaluation increase.  And so we  have a evaluation that's high, where somewhere in the 80th, 90th percentile  spending on a day of historical evaluations or a high level of equity  evaluations.</p><p> And so it's really earnings driven looking at the 2019, we really can't  look at 2018 because you had this big tailwind from tax lifting the level  of profits.  And so with the growth rate and profits is really looking into  2019 and looking around probably five percent is the trajectory of growth.   That's the type of return we are looking at in the next -- from now to the  end of the year.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  And, David, that was the one with other concerns, it was rates.</p><p> KOSTIN:  Right</p><p> FERRO:  And for you guys, is the danger zone still the four percent, we're  someway of it?</p><p> KOSTIN:  I think got two issues, speed and level.</p><p> FERRO:  Yes.</p><p> KOSTIN:  Speed, we're looking at something as a tipping point vicinity 20  to 30 basis point increase in 10 year bond yields within a month.  That  swiftness of an increase in rates would be of concern in the equity market.   Lower, more gentle rise, a lower speed of increase would be less  concerning.   And from a level point of view, it's something in the  vicinity of 375 to four percent on 10 year US treasury yields that would be  a build head wind for equity returns.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  David, just a final word on that.</p><p> KOSTIN:  Well, when you think about where you find the earnings growth, the  fastest revenue growth which is driving earnings growth, those companies  have definitely been outperforming, that's a place to focus on.  And it's  interesting those are stocks that mutual fund financers are underweight.</p><p> Some of the large cap glamour stocks, think about Amazon, Apple, think of  Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are underweight in portfolios, despite  the fact that expectation is something in the vicinity of 20 plus percent  revenue growth which is five times faster than the rest of the market and  you have margins that are twice as high and financer actually underweight  this visions despite that the dynamic.</p><p> It's a way to combat the idea of --  in our forecast is that you have  higher bond yields as you need to have better revenue growth and earning  growth.</p><p> FERRO:  David Kostin, of Goldman Sachs, would you please decide it's going  to be sticking with us along George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment  Institute and Gina Martin Adams, our Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  And still with me, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, George Rusnak of  Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg  Intelligence.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  Flows and flows, with the story of last year that explain the  effects dynamic.  Euro dollar picking up, people wanted to buy Europe, EM  picking up people want to do by EM.  David, we touched on this and I want  to build on it with you.  You guys have been looking at a basket of stocks  that have high revenue growth in the United States.</p><p> KOSTIN:  Correct.</p><p> FERRO:  The Goldman basket which has performed really, really well, and I  just wonder whether that's going to develop to be a bigger theme this year.   Forget about Euro, forget about (EM) there is some really good growth here  in the United States.</p><p> KOSTIN:  So you definitely have better growth, it's more durable, it's more  visible.  And from a corporate perspective, if you are worried about and  we're concerned about higher input cost potentially, from a labor point  view, from a capital perspective in terms of higher interest rates, and a  materials perspective, in terms of tariffs potential can potentially  imposed, all of those are pressures on margins.</p><p> And so, the only combatant you have against that is sales growth.  Where  are the companies with the best revenue growth?  That's the intuition  behind focusing on these companies and they're across every -- within every  sector, those are the companies that are is comprised of those the  companies that have the best top line sales</p><p> MALE:  And was it --</p><p> KOSTIN:  Was a Bloomberg ticker and you can pull up people trade it.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FERRO:  If you listen to a program like this over the last year, you would  think that tech was really crowded, a big consensus trade and whenever it  gets on this program, just so have you understand, typically my producers  asked them, what is your contrarian trade?  What is your added consensus  called?</p><p> And David Kostin replies were relative to what and record to mutual funds,  to your point, somebody is big tech mantis (ph) contrarian.  Walk me  through that because to some of our view is that's going to stand quite  foreign.</p><p> KOSTIN:  So the, I call glamour stocks, your Amazon, your Microsoft,  Facebook, Apple, those companies, the perception is everyone owns those  stocks.  And that is not supported by the data.</p><p> We look through almost to $2 trillion of holdings, the individual funds,  compared within their different benchmarks, core growth value, they are  those fundamentals are generally underweight those facts, persistently,  consistently.</p><p> And that is in here that was indicating.  We found at odds with the fact  that such significant premium growth in revenues, and you have much higher  margins.  And that would be in my view supportive of to do that performance  of some of those companies.</p><p> And why that's the case is a perception that they are -- everyone owns  them.  And be they're concerned about potential deregulation or regulation  and some of the --</p><p> FERRO:  Yes.</p><p> KOSTIN:  -- monopolistic discussion that takes place in regulations in  Washington or Europe, so those of you at risks, but the driving revenues is  I think about the key.</p><p> So that's the first observation is where have viewed it's a different or  variant from consensus and on the hedge fund side -- hedge fund have a very  small position in finances.  They have a less than 10 percent of the net  exposure, when you net out the gross and along the shores, about 10  percent, as about 15 percent index.</p><p> Obviously, a hedge fund is not a benchmark oriented they are total return  oriented.  And we see what's catalyst in this market where it's been sort  of chopping, move around side ways.  You have in the next three weeks, you  have the CCAR results.  The stress test results and the fed will be, in our  view likely to be approving, authorizing a return of dividends and buybacks  for the next 12 months and increase about 20 percent.</p><p> And that is we saw that last year.  Trading environment, when you had the  CCAR results came out, bank stocks rallied significantly on the back of a  significant increase in the planned capital return holders, and that I  think is a catalyst.  So we are divergent from consensus or the broad view  on the hedge fund side and on the mutual fund side</p><p> FERRO:  David Kostin great to catch up with up, with Goldman Sachs.  So  let's stay longer with this next time, I know you're going to go.  David  Kostin, great to have you with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And from a level point of view, it's something in the vicinity of 375 to four percent on 10 year US treasury yields that would be a build head wind for equity returns.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: David, just a final word on that.</p><p>KOSTIN: Well, when you think about where you find the earnings growth, the fastest revenue growth which is driving earnings growth, those companies have definitely been outperforming, that's a place to focus on. And it's interesting those are stocks that mutual fund financers are underweight.</p><p>Some of the large cap glamour stocks, think about Amazon, Apple, think of Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are underweight in portfolios, despite the fact that expectation is something in the vicinity of 20 plus percent revenue growth which is five times faster than the rest of the market and you have margins that are twice as high and financer actually underweight this visions despite that the dynamic.</p><p>It's a way to combat the idea of -- in our forecast is that you have higher bond yields as you need to have better revenue growth and earning growth.</p><p>FERRO: David Kostin, of Goldman Sachs, would you please decide it's going to be sticking with us along George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Gina Martin Adams, our Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: And still with me, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: Flows and flows, with the story of last year that explain the effects dynamic. Euro dollar picking up, people wanted to buy Europe, EM picking up people want to do by EM. David, we touched on this and I want to build on it with you. You guys have been looking at a basket of stocks that have high revenue growth in the United States.</p><p>KOSTIN: Correct.</p><p>FERRO: The Goldman basket which has performed really, really well, and I just wonder whether that's going to develop to be a bigger theme this year. Forget about Euro, forget about (EM) there is some really good growth here in the United States.</p><p>KOSTIN: So you definitely have better growth, it's more durable, it's more visible. And from a corporate perspective, if you are worried about and we're concerned about higher input cost potentially, from a labor point view, from a capital perspective in terms of higher interest rates, and a materials perspective, in terms of tariffs potential can potentially imposed, all of those are pressures on margins.</p><p>And so, the only combatant you have against that is sales growth. Where are the companies with the best revenue growth? That's the intuition behind focusing on these companies and they're across every -- within every sector, those are the companies that are is comprised of those the companies that have the best top line sales</p><p>MALE: And was it --</p><p>KOSTIN: Was a Bloomberg ticker and you can pull up people trade it.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: If you listen to a program like this over the last year, you would think that tech was really crowded, a big consensus trade and whenever it gets on this program, just so have you understand, typically my producers asked them, what is your contrarian trade?

Guys, great to have you with me around the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David, let's begin with you. What are you telling clients about the situation as it unfolds and is it something that we should be worried about?</p><p>DAVID KOSTIN, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Well it's clearly an issue. It's clear risk to margins and in the cost. So the message we've been discussing with clients has been focused on some of the fundamentals that are more domestically facing. And so, let's look at financials which is an area that is most affected by deregulation and some lower taxes and the upcoming CCAR results which are likely to be really sometime in late June. So that's one area to focus on.</p><p>And then, focus on companies that are driving their top line sales and the argument behind that is it's less affected by some of the higher input costs that are likely to emanate as a result of the some of the tariffs.</p><p>FERRO: There are two points there, let's deal with the first one.</p><p>KOSTIN: OK.</p><p>FERRO: On the financials, it feels like a shifted domestic kind of story and away from international Gina, are you hearing much more of that thing as well?</p><p>GINA MARTIN ADAMS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Oh absolutely and I think it's playing out on the data with small have index making new highs. The micro caps continuing to make new highs. The S&amp;P is sort of frustratingly stuck in this range. And part of the reason probably is because the dollar is rallying and marks or to some non-domestic risks.</p><p>I think really interestingly, you've got this really strong rally in small- cap financials does not being confirmed in the large cap financials. Does that ultimately mean that large cap needs to catch up? They are pretty domestically focused as well or does large cap continue to live because they do have a decent amount of exposure overseas. They do have flow top line growth --</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>MARTIN ADAMS: -- as opposed to some of the other components in the index and where can we get that big (move) in large caps financial that's a big question mark for them.</p><p>KOSTIN: So you've seen some small-cap banks that had loan growth now running up almost 8 percent?</p><p>MARTIN: Right.</p><p>KOSTIN: --from the data, which is just one of the key drivers. As well as the ability companies return cash to share this to dividends and buybacks and we hear that in about within the month, by the end of June. We're expecting something in the vicinity of 20 percent incremental dividends and buybacks that will be a key driver. And that will effects of small caps as you indicated as well as large caps.</p><p>MALE: Just to jump in, very quickly and bring you some comments from the President of the United States, Donald Trump speaks right now. Let's take and listen.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: The President of the United States there discussing an upcoming meeting potentially with the North Korean leader that could happen at some point potentially in the next month or so. And just another brick in a wall of worries, David Kostin, not just trade, the foreign policy as well, usually, we climb that wall of worry.</p><p>KOSTIN: Right.</p><p>FERRO: And the last week or so been battering into it like this, why?</p><p>KOSTIN: Well, the answer there is now variety of outcomes that may or they may or made in that environment, whether the shift is what's happening with corporate earnings and some of the fundamentals?</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>KOSTIN: What are companies doing? You see CEO confidence remains very high. Consumer confidence 77 percent economy also indicating it's high levels, one of the highest in the number of years, small business optimism also very high.</p><p>So all these indications of confidence are more fundamentally rooted, so there's a lot of geopolitical issues clearly a risk out there. Not clear how you want to invest along that basis.</p><p>FERRO: So one fundamental question I guess for you that you've been exploring, David, is whether earnings expansion can offset evaluation contraction. Candid, what's the base case for Goldman?</p><p>KOSTIN: I think the base case is you have earnings growth, which is led by economic expansion. But you don't get an evaluation increase. And so we have a evaluation that's high, where somewhere in the 80th, 90th percentile spending on a day of historical evaluations or a high level of equity evaluations.</p><p>And so it's really earnings driven looking at the 2019, we really can't look at 2018 because you had this big tailwind from tax lifting the level of profits. And so with the growth rate and profits is really looking into 2019 and looking around probably five percent is the trajectory of growth. That's the type of return we are looking at in the next -- from now to the end of the year.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: And, David, that was the one with other concerns, it was rates.</p><p>KOSTIN: Right</p><p>FERRO: And for you guys, is the danger zone still the four percent, we're someway of it?</p><p>KOSTIN: I think got two issues, speed and level.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>KOSTIN: Speed, we're looking at something as a tipping point vicinity 20 to 30 basis point increase in 10 year bond yields within a month. That swiftness of an increase in rates would be of concern in the equity market. Lower, more gentle rise, a lower speed of increase would be less concerning. And from a level point of view, it's something in the vicinity of 375 to four percent on 10 year US treasury yields that would be a build head wind for equity returns.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: David, just a final word on that.</p><p>KOSTIN: Well, when you think about where you find the earnings growth, the fastest revenue growth which is driving earnings growth, those companies have definitely been outperforming, that's a place to focus on. And it's interesting those are stocks that mutual fund financers are underweight.</p><p>Some of the large cap glamour stocks, think about Amazon, Apple, think of Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are underweight in portfolios, despite the fact that expectation is something in the vicinity of 20 plus percent revenue growth which is five times faster than the rest of the market and you have margins that are twice as high and financer actually underweight this visions despite that the dynamic.</p><p>It's a way to combat the idea of -- in our forecast is that you have higher bond yields as you need to have better revenue growth and earning growth.</p><p>FERRO: David Kostin, of Goldman Sachs, would you please decide it's going to be sticking with us along George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute and Gina Martin Adams, our Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: And still with me, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO: Flows and flows, with the story of last year that explain the effects dynamic.

Guys, great to have you  with me around the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David, let's begin with you.  What are you telling clients about the  situation as it unfolds and is it something that we should be worried  about?</p><p>DAVID KOSTIN, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, GOLDMAN SACHS:   Well it's  clearly an issue.  It's clear risk to margins and in the cost.  So the  message we've been discussing with clients has been focused on some of the  fundamentals that are more domestically facing.  And so, let's look at  financials which is an area that is most affected by deregulation and some  lower taxes and the upcoming CCAR results which are likely to be really  sometime in late June.  So that's one area to focus on.</p><p>And then, focus on companies that are driving their top line sales and the  argument behind that is it's less affected by some of the higher input  costs that are likely to emanate as a result of the some of the tariffs.</p><p>FERRO:  There are two points there, let's deal with the first one.</p><p>KOSTIN:  OK.</p><p>FERRO:  On the financials, it feels like a shifted domestic kind of story  and away from international Gina, are you hearing much more of that thing  as well?</p><p>GINA MARTIN ADAMS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Oh absolutely and I think it's  playing out on the data with small have index making new highs.  The micro  caps continuing to make new highs.  The S&amp;P is sort of frustratingly stuck  in this range.  And part of the reason probably is because the dollar is  rallying and marks or to some non-domestic risks.</p><p>I think really interestingly, you've got this really strong rally in small- cap financials does not being confirmed in the large cap financials.  Does  that ultimately mean that large cap needs to catch up?   They are pretty  domestically focused as well or does large cap continue to live because  they do have a decent amount of exposure overseas.  They do have flow top  line growth --</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>MARTIN ADAMS:  -- as opposed to some of the other components in the index  and where can we get that big (move) in large caps financial that's a big  question mark for them.</p><p>KOSTIN:  So you've seen some small-cap banks that had loan growth now  running up almost 8 percent?</p><p>MARTIN:  Right.</p><p>KOSTIN:  --from the data, which is just one of the key drivers. As well as  the ability companies return cash to share this to dividends and buybacks  and we hear that in about within the month, by the end of June.  We're  expecting something in the vicinity of 20 percent incremental dividends and  buybacks that will be a key driver.  And that will effects of small caps as  you indicated as well as large caps.</p><p>MALE:  Just to jump in, very quickly and bring you some comments from the  President of the United States, Donald Trump speaks right now.  Let's take  and listen.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  The President of the United States there discussing an upcoming  meeting potentially with the North Korean leader that could happen at some  point potentially in the next month or so.  And just another brick in a  wall of worries, David Kostin, not just trade, the foreign policy as well,  usually, we climb that wall of worry.</p><p>KOSTIN:  Right.</p><p>FERRO:  And the last week or so been battering into it like this, why?</p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, the answer there is now variety of outcomes that may or they  may or made in that environment, whether the shift is what's happening with  corporate earnings and some of the fundamentals?</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>KOSTIN:  What are companies doing?  You see CEO confidence remains very  high.  Consumer confidence 77 percent economy also indicating it's high  levels, one of the highest in the number of years, small business optimism  also very high.</p><p>So all these indications of confidence are more fundamentally rooted, so  there's a lot of geopolitical issues clearly a risk out there.  Not clear  how you want to invest along that basis.</p><p>FERRO:  So one fundamental question I guess for you that you've been  exploring, David, is whether earnings expansion can offset evaluation  contraction.  Candid, what's the base case for Goldman?</p><p>KOSTIN:  I think the base case is you have earnings growth, which is led by  economic expansion.  But you don't get an evaluation increase.  And so we  have a evaluation that's high, where somewhere in the 80th, 90th percentile  spending on a day of historical evaluations or a high level of equity  evaluations.</p><p>And so it's really earnings driven looking at the 2019, we really can't  look at 2018 because you had this big tailwind from tax lifting the level  of profits.  And so with the growth rate and profits is really looking into  2019 and looking around probably five percent is the trajectory of growth.   That's the type of return we are looking at in the next -- from now to the  end of the year.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  And, David, that was the one with other concerns, it was rates.</p><p>KOSTIN:  Right</p><p>FERRO:  And for you guys, is the danger zone still the four percent, we're  someway of it?</p><p>KOSTIN:  I think got two issues, speed and level.</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>KOSTIN:  Speed, we're looking at something as a tipping point vicinity 20  to 30 basis point increase in 10 year bond yields within a month.  That  swiftness of an increase in rates would be of concern in the equity market.   Lower, more gentle rise, a lower speed of increase would be less  concerning.   And from a level point of view, it's something in the  vicinity of 375 to four percent on 10 year US treasury yields that would be  a build head wind for equity returns.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  David, just a final word on that.</p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, when you think about where you find the earnings growth, the  fastest revenue growth which is driving earnings growth, those companies  have definitely been outperforming, that's a place to focus on.  And it's  interesting those are stocks that mutual fund financers are underweight.</p><p>Some of the large cap glamour stocks, think about Amazon, Apple, think of  Microsoft, Facebook, these companies are underweight in portfolios, despite  the fact that expectation is something in the vicinity of 20 plus percent  revenue growth which is five times faster than the rest of the market and  you have margins that are twice as high and financer actually underweight  this visions despite that the dynamic.</p><p>It's a way to combat the idea of --  in our forecast is that you have  higher bond yields as you need to have better revenue growth and earning  growth.</p><p>FERRO:  David Kostin, of Goldman Sachs, would you please decide it's going  to be sticking with us along George Rusnak of Wells Fargo Investment  Institute and Gina Martin Adams, our Bloomberg Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  And still with me, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, George Rusnak of  Wells Fargo Investment Institute, and Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg  Intelligence.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  Flows and flows, with the story of last year that explain the  effects dynamic.  Euro dollar picking up, people wanted to buy Europe, EM  picking up people want to do by EM.  David, we touched on this and I want  to build on it with you.  You guys have been looking at a basket of stocks  that have high revenue growth in the United States.</p><p>KOSTIN:  Correct.</p><p>FERRO:  The Goldman basket which has performed really, really well, and I  just wonder whether that's going to develop to be a bigger theme this year.   Forget about Euro, forget about (EM) there is some really good growth here  in the United States.</p><p>KOSTIN:  So you definitely have better growth, it's more durable, it's more  visible.  And from a corporate perspective, if you are worried about and  we're concerned about higher input cost potentially, from a labor point  view, from a capital perspective in terms of higher interest rates, and a  materials perspective, in terms of tariffs potential can potentially  imposed, all of those are pressures on margins.</p><p>And so, the only combatant you have against that is sales growth.  Where  are the companies with the best revenue growth?  That's the intuition  behind focusing on these companies and they're across every -- within every  sector, those are the companies that are is comprised of those the  companies that have the best top line sales</p><p>MALE:  And was it --</p><p>KOSTIN:  Was a Bloomberg ticker and you can pull up people trade it.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FERRO:  If you listen to a program like this over the last year, you would  think that tech was really crowded, a big consensus trade and whenever it  gets on this program, just so have you understand, typically my producers  asked them, what is your contrarian trade?  What is your added consensus  called?</p><p>And David Kostin replies were relative to what and record to mutual funds,  to your point, somebody is big tech mantis (ph) contrarian.  Walk me  through that because to some of our view is that's going to stand quite  foreign.</p><p>KOSTIN:  So the, I call glamour stocks, your Amazon, your Microsoft,  Facebook, Apple, those companies, the perception is everyone owns those  stocks.  And that is not supported by the data.</p><p>We look through almost to $2 trillion of holdings, the individual funds,  compared within their different benchmarks, core growth value, they are  those fundamentals are generally underweight those facts, persistently,  consistently.</p><p>And that is in here that was indicating.  We found at odds with the fact  that such significant premium growth in revenues, and you have much higher  margins.  And that would be in my view supportive of to do that performance  of some of those companies.</p><p>And why that's the case is a perception that they are -- everyone owns  them.  And be they're concerned about potential deregulation or regulation  and some of the --</p><p>FERRO:  Yes.</p><p>KOSTIN:  -- monopolistic discussion that takes place in regulations in  Washington or Europe, so those of you at risks, but the driving revenues is  I think about the key.</p><p>So that's the first observation is where have viewed it's a different or  variant from consensus and on the hedge fund side -- hedge fund have a very  small position in finances.  They have a less than 10 percent of the net  exposure, when you net out the gross and along the shores, about 10  percent, as about 15 percent index.</p><p>Obviously, a hedge fund is not a benchmark oriented they are total return  oriented.  And we see what's catalyst in this market where it's been sort  of chopping, move around side ways.  You have in the next three weeks, you  have the CCAR results.  The stress test results and the fed will be, in our  view likely to be approving, authorizing a return of dividends and buybacks  for the next 12 months and increase about 20 percent.</p><p>And that is we saw that last year.  Trading environment, when you had the  CCAR results came out, bank stocks rallied significantly on the back of a  significant increase in the planned capital return holders, and that I  think is a catalyst.  So we are divergent from consensus or the broad view  on the hedge fund side and on the mutual fund side</p><p>FERRO:  David Kostin great to catch up with up, with Goldman Sachs.  So  let's stay longer with this next time, I know you're going to go.  David  Kostin, great to have you with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The firm's directors are advisers to Zuckerberg, 35, not genuine overseers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook and its Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp platforms have a combined 6.2 billion users. That's 81 per cent of humanity - a big number even accounting for duplication.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's share of the global market in social networking exceeds 80 per cent.</p><p>With 2018 revenues of $55 billion, Facebook leaves little room for rivals. It has been eight years since anyone has dared attempt a major social-media startup. (All figures in U.S. dollars.)</p><p>Facebook did not achieve its dominance through innovation. It used the expedient of 72 takeovers costing a total of $23.4 billion to purchase the innovations of others.</p><p>With its commanding market share, Facebook is immensely profitable. Facebook's 2018 profit margin was 39.6 per cent. The number for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that year was 1.3 per cent.</p><p>With global regulators and heads of government impatient for reform at the internet giants, after years of ineffective fines, Facebook's critics are stepping up the pressure on Zuckerberg's firm.</p><p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice announced America's most aggressive investigation to date into monopolist practices at internet firms.</p><p>But that effort is likely to fail.</p><p>The U.S. is expected to put several internet companies under the microscope, including Facebook, Google Inc. (owner of YouTube, a social-media video platform), Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc.</p><p>Yet Facebook, Google and Twitter are not guilty of consumer price-gouging, the narrow U.S. definition of monopolistic abuse that guides most antitrust prosecutions. Their services are free.</p><p>And Amazon and Apple are not monopolies. Walmart Inc. alone has twice the revenues of Amazon. And in smartphones, Apple's chief source of revenues, the company trails Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Inc. in market share.</p><p>The most effective remedy to Big Tech's market abuses is to focus on one alleged miscreant, Facebook, a near-monopoly with a history of dubious practices. If charges against Facebook resulted in a conviction, the firm would be broken up.</p><p>Drastic as that might seem, there are tougher measures. \"The most effective path to reform would be to shut down the platforms at least temporarily,\" Roger McNamee, a U.S. venture capitalist and early investor in Facebook, told a Canadian House of Commons committee in May.</p><p>\"Companies with responsible business models will emerge overnight to fill the void.\"</p><p>And other Big Tech firms might embrace reform to avoid Facebook's fate.</p><p>Facebook has too much power</p><p>\"Mark [Zuckerberg]'s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government,\" Facebook co-founder Chris R. Hughes wrote in a New York Times essay in May. Hughes has called for the breakup of Facebook.</p><p>\"He has created a Leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice,\" Hughes wrote.</p><p>Facebook uses the vast trove of user data it collects to attract advertisers. Any future uses for that data will ultimately be determined by Zuckerberg.</p><p>Facebook provided the personal data of 87 million Facebook users, including about 620,000 Canadians, to British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The data was used to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election later that year.</p><p>The U.S. fined Facebook $5 billion this month for misleading users about the use of their data in that case. The fine equals one-quarter of Facebook's 2018 profits - a cost of doing business.</p><p>It was for Zuckerberg, not New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, to decide to take down the live-streaming video of two mosque massacres in Christchurch on March 15. By that point, the video had been viewed, according to Facebook, about 4,000 times.</p><p>The decision not to act on pleas that live-streaming videos be pre-screened before they are posted is Zuckerberg's. (Although YouTube has the same policy.)</p><p>In late 2017, Zuckerberg decided to shut down Facebook accounts of Myanmar users whom he felt were inciting genocide. But ahead of this year's general election in India, Zuckerberg chose not to shut down WhatsApp accounts of extremists spreading hate messages before the vote.</p><p>Facebook is effectively a utility, but it's regulated by Zuckerberg. There's nothing to stop Zuckerberg from denying service in Montreal, Germany or Western Australia. His decisions are self-interested, and he has admitted to mistakes.</p><p>What would the breakup look like?</p><p>Facebook would simply spin off its huge Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms, and possibly its News Feed as well. They would become stand-alone, independent companies competing with each other and their former parent.</p><p>With the exception of the News Feed, a notorious disseminator of fake news and conspiracy theories, those platforms and services are acquisitions that can be unwound with relative ease.</p><p>Zuckerberg is now trying to integrate them to make a breakup more difficult.</p><p>The antitrust settlement would include a five-year moratorium on acquisitions by Facebook, giving established rivals and startups the time to effectively compete with it.</p><p>Action against Facebook would be accompanied by a new regulatory agency to better protect the privacy of all internet users. The new U.S. agency, which soon would have counterparts in other jurisdictions, could be modelled on the EU's landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>The GDPR guarantees users a minimum of privacy protection. It would have to be upgraded to give users maximum control of their data, full disclosure of what is being collected, and an effortless user ability to remove or correct personal data.</p><p>A breakup would lead to more innovation online</p><p>Chief among the benefits is maximum user control over their personal information. And social-media users would have greater choice. They could pay for sites with no advertising, or pick the platform with the highest privacy standards. Competing news feeds, as apps, could compete on accuracy, price and global scope or hyperlocal content.</p><p>And the new regulator, in addition to preventing market abuses, would also create guidelines for acceptable speech, drawn from existing hate-speech laws in most Western countries.</p><p>In voluntarily dismantling enterprises, corporate dealmakers speak of \"unlocking\" shareholder value. And that has been the result of most corporate breakups. In the decade following the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T, the seven successor companies to Ma Bell tripled in shareholder value.</p><p>But probably the biggest benefit of a Facebook breakup, and pressure to \"unlock\" shareholder value at other Big Tech firms, would be its impact in unleashing - or restoring - innovative entrepreneurship.</p><p>The 1990s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft Corp. for illegally using its size to crush a pioneering Web browser firm (Netscape) helped keep Bill Gates from taking control of the early internet.</p><p>And that cleared the way for thousands of startup internet innovators, including Mark Zuckerberg, whose firm was launched just 14 years ago in his Harvard dorm room.</p><p>David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star.

The firm's directors are advisers to Zuckerberg, 35, not genuine overseers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook and its Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp platforms have a combined 6.2 billion users. That's 81 per cent of humanity - a big number even accounting for duplication.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's share of the global market in social networking exceeds 80 per cent.</p><p>With 2018 revenues of $55 billion, Facebook leaves little room for rivals. It has been eight years since anyone has dared attempt a major social-media startup. (All figures in U.S. dollars.)</p><p>Facebook did not achieve its dominance through innovation. It used the expedient of 72 takeovers costing a total of $23.4 billion to purchase the innovations of others.</p><p>With its commanding market share, Facebook is immensely profitable. Facebook's 2018 profit margin was 39.6 per cent. The number for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that year was 1.3 per cent.</p><p>With global regulators and heads of government impatient for reform at the internet giants, after years of ineffective fines, Facebook's critics are stepping up the pressure on Zuckerberg's firm.</p><p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice announced America's most aggressive investigation to date into monopolist practices at internet firms.</p><p>But that effort is likely to fail.</p><p>The U.S. is expected to put several internet companies under the microscope, including Facebook, Google Inc. (owner of YouTube, a social-media video platform), Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc.</p><p>Yet Facebook, Google and Twitter are not guilty of consumer price-gouging, the narrow U.S. definition of monopolistic abuse that guides most antitrust prosecutions. Their services are free.</p><p>And Amazon and Apple are not monopolies. Walmart Inc. alone has twice the revenues of Amazon. And in smartphones, Apple's chief source of revenues, the company trails Samsung Electronics Co. and Huawei Technologies Inc. in market share.</p><p>The most effective remedy to Big Tech's market abuses is to focus on one alleged miscreant, Facebook, a near-monopoly with a history of dubious practices. If charges against Facebook resulted in a conviction, the firm would be broken up.</p><p>Drastic as that might seem, there are tougher measures. \"The most effective path to reform would be to shut down the platforms at least temporarily,\" Roger McNamee, a U.S. venture capitalist and early investor in Facebook, told a Canadian House of Commons committee in May.</p><p>\"Companies with responsible business models will emerge overnight to fill the void.\"</p><p>And other Big Tech firms might embrace reform to avoid Facebook's fate.</p><p>Facebook has too much power</p><p>\"Mark [Zuckerberg]'s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government,\" Facebook co-founder Chris R. Hughes wrote in a New York Times essay in May. Hughes has called for the breakup of Facebook.</p><p>\"He has created a Leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice,\" Hughes wrote.</p><p>Facebook uses the vast trove of user data it collects to attract advertisers. Any future uses for that data will ultimately be determined by Zuckerberg.</p><p>Facebook provided the personal data of 87 million Facebook users, including about 620,000 Canadians, to British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The data was used to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election later that year.</p><p>The U.S. fined Facebook $5 billion this month for misleading users about the use of their data in that case. The fine equals one-quarter of Facebook's 2018 profits - a cost of doing business.</p><p>It was for Zuckerberg, not New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, to decide to take down the live-streaming video of two mosque massacres in Christchurch on March 15. By that point, the video had been viewed, according to Facebook, about 4,000 times.</p><p>The decision not to act on pleas that live-streaming videos be pre-screened before they are posted is Zuckerberg's. (Although YouTube has the same policy.)</p><p>In late 2017, Zuckerberg decided to shut down Facebook accounts of Myanmar users whom he felt were inciting genocide. But ahead of this year's general election in India, Zuckerberg chose not to shut down WhatsApp accounts of extremists spreading hate messages before the vote.</p><p>Facebook is effectively a utility, but it's regulated by Zuckerberg. There's nothing to stop Zuckerberg from denying service in Montreal, Germany or Western Australia. His decisions are self-interested, and he has admitted to mistakes.</p><p>What would the breakup look like?</p><p>Facebook would simply spin off its huge Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms, and possibly its News Feed as well. They would become stand-alone, independent companies competing with each other and their former parent.</p><p>With the exception of the News Feed, a notorious disseminator of fake news and conspiracy theories, those platforms and services are acquisitions that can be unwound with relative ease.</p><p>Zuckerberg is now trying to integrate them to make a breakup more difficult.</p><p>The antitrust settlement would include a five-year moratorium on acquisitions by Facebook, giving established rivals and startups the time to effectively compete with it.</p><p>Action against Facebook would be accompanied by a new regulatory agency to better protect the privacy of all internet users. The new U.S. agency, which soon would have counterparts in other jurisdictions, could be modelled on the EU's landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>The GDPR guarantees users a minimum of privacy protection. It would have to be upgraded to give users maximum control of their data, full disclosure of what is being collected, and an effortless user ability to remove or correct personal data.</p><p>A breakup would lead to more innovation online</p><p>Chief among the benefits is maximum user control over their personal information. And social-media users would have greater choice. They could pay for sites with no advertising, or pick the platform with the highest privacy standards. Competing news feeds, as apps, could compete on accuracy, price and global scope or hyperlocal content.</p><p>And the new regulator, in addition to preventing market abuses, would also create guidelines for acceptable speech, drawn from existing hate-speech laws in most Western countries.</p><p>In voluntarily dismantling enterprises, corporate dealmakers speak of \"unlocking\" shareholder value. And that has been the result of most corporate breakups. In the decade following the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;amp;T, the seven successor companies to Ma Bell tripled in shareholder value.</p><p>But probably the biggest benefit of a Facebook breakup, and pressure to \"unlock\" shareholder value at other Big Tech firms, would be its impact in unleashing - or restoring - innovative entrepreneurship.</p><p>The 1990s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft Corp. for illegally using its size to crush a pioneering Web browser firm (Netscape) helped keep Bill Gates from taking control of the early internet.</p><p>And that cleared the way for thousands of startup internet innovators, including Mark Zuckerberg, whose firm was launched just 14 years ago in his Harvard dorm room.</p><p>David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star.

In recent years, governments in Western economies have been in retreat, afraid of their own shadows. Business has not filled the void. Left to its self-determined course, capitalism has failed to address the crises in climate emergency; income inequality; shortages of affordable housing and of skills; and of deficient transportation and other infrastructure. Business investment has not risen in tandem with burgeoning corporate profits. </p><p>Instead, the profits have gone into stock buybacks, executive bonuses and dividends rather than sufficient reinvestment, slowing the pace of innovation. \"Warnings that the capital markets aren't functioning properly are everywhere,\" Mariana Mazzucato, director of the University College London's innovation institute told Fortune in December. In Canada, popular support for pharmacare and the world's first national carbon-pricing system mark a turning point. So does the growing public demand that governments rein in Big Tech and the threats it poses to personal privacy and public safety. But the swing in favour of state involvement will be most pronounced in climate crisis. The Bank of Canada and other central banks are warning with ever greater urgency that the global economic system cannot withstand the unprecedented catastrophes - what Warren Buffett calls \"super-cats\" - for which humanity must brace. A start this year will be discussions over a new state-supported global backstop for insurers, who face insolvency with the first string of claims arising from massive climate-related property damage events. Climate crisis demands a return to the model of public-private partnership that created the modern computer age, the space missions and the internet era.</p><p>Cell-based food</p><p>The current plant-based food movement is driven by concerns over healthier diets, animal welfare, and the smaller carbon footprint of plant-based foods than that of livestock. The next step, food derived from the cells of cows and poultry - or \"cellular agriculture\" - puts protein-rich meat back on the menu with no slaughterhouses and, unlike plant-based food, less use of limited fresh water and other taxes on the land imposed by plant cultivation. Plant-based meat replacements also require extraordinary processing to make them palatable, and the disagreeable taste of first-generation plant-based foods is a stigma the industry is still working to overcome. The 30 or so Canadian and global firms developing \"cultivated meat\" from animal cells, determined not to make that mistake, won't have their first products to market until 2023. But investment in lab-based meat has ramped up, increasing by 120 per cent globally last year, to $80 million, to supply a market modestly estimated at $514 million by 2030. For Canadian start-up firms in this new realm, including Edmonton's Future Fields and Appleton Meats of Vancouver, the challenge isn't the science, which is well advanced. The obstacle is a lack of venture capital for the costly equipment required in the manufacturing process. A fraction of the billions of dollars Canadians invested in the pot craze would ensure that Canadian scientists and entrepreneurs have a place in what could be the biggest revolution in food production since the advent of crop rotation. Otherwise, the new industry will be gobbled up by the same foreign-based Big Food combines that have long dominated Canadian food consumption.</p><p>The rise in renewable energy and the SUV challenge</p><p>Fortunately, coal, the dirtiest of all fuels used in electricity production, is projected to drop to 34 per cent of global power sources by decade's end, and be overtaken by renewables such as wind, solar and hydro power, accounting for 42 per cent of global electricity production by 2030. Wind power, once dismissed as an unreliable energy source, is poised to boom in 2020 and beyond. The European Union (EU), world's third-largest economy after the U.S. and China, already looks to wind for two per cent of its power generation. That percentage was recently forecast to rise ninefold by 2040 by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in its annual World Energy Outlook report in December. Companies are not only planning huge offshore wind farms in the North Sea - where energy firms can harvest stronger and steadier winds - but in offshore North America, China, Japan and South Korea, as well. That favourable trend strengthens another, the higher-than-expected adoption rate of all-electric vehicles (EVs), a record two million of which were bought last year. But against that gain for cleaner air is a surge in sport utility vehicle sales (SUVs), now accounting for 42 per cent of passenger-vehicle sales, more than double the rate in 2000. Note to investors: Pay attention to firms like oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. of Calgary that are investing heavily in wind power, wisely hedging its bets against a decline in fossil fuels; and automakers like Nissan, Hyundai and Volkswagen's Audi that lead in the electric SUV race.</p><p>A new debate about 5G's implications</p><p>The social consequences of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks will start to come under scrutiny in 2020, as 5G networks roll out in Canada over the next two years. About 10 times faster than current technology, 5G will see data moving at record speed and volume, and promises to connect every digital device, from cars to refrigerators to water-filtration-plant control rooms. The widespread misgivings that have already arisen about massive data collection will become acute. Who will set the rules on what data can be collected, and to what use it can be put? What new cybersecurity threats are we creating? That discussion will intensify this year, as the telcos pursue their goal of connecting everything digital in the country. The new technology has its virtues. As an enabler of low-cost virtual reality (VR), 5G will provide surgeons with detailed images of the patients they are treating, and tell firefighters exactly what they will encounter as they enter a burning structure. With an error rate one-thousandth that of current technology, 5G will be a blessing in \"mission critical\" applications in health care, manufacturing and transportation networks. And consumers can expect more efficient households, eHealth systems and supply chains in retailing, utilities and public safety, with 5G's ability to connect about one million digital devices per square kilometre. Yet 5G also raises the spectre of a surveillance society, with ubiquitous sensors tracking our every move. We can't allow 5G to proceed as social media have, an unregulated phenomenon whose downside caught us unprepared.</p><p>Business loses an excuse for underinvesting in Canada</p><p>Canadian businesses are expected to continue underinvesting in their enterprises in 2020, according to the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), worsening a trend that has seen Canadian corporate investment drop by about 20 per cent since the oil-price slump of 2014. Canada touts itself as an emerging high-tech superpower, given all the global firms that have set up their artificial intelligence (AI) workshops in Canada. But that's foreign capital. By contrast, Canadian firms have cut investment in intellectual property development by $532,000 per worker over the past decade, and reduced their total capex by $1,446 per worker. No wonder Canadian GDP per capita - that is, standard of living - has actually dropped three per cent from 2010 levels, a lost decade that contrasts with the 35 per cent surge in U.S. GDP per capita in that period. Business-lobby whining about unfavourable Canadian tax and regulatory conditions is nonsensical. Even before Ottawa gave business a whopping additional tax break in accelerated depreciation on capital investments, Canada was already in the highest ranks of countries for ease of doing business. And offshore investors facing those same \"unfavourable\" Canadian conditions poured $65.8 billion into Canadian investments last year, close to the record set before the oil-price collapse. The stark reality is that Canadian business has less faith in Canada than outsiders. With the likely ebbing this year of global trade tensions that Canadian business also cites for lack of enterprise, we'll see this year if judicious caution or unwarranted trepidation is the real issue here.</p><p>David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star.

In recent years, governments in Western economies have been in retreat, afraid of their own shadows. Business has not filled the void. Left to its self-determined course, capitalism has failed to address the crises in climate emergency; income inequality; shortages of affordable housing and of skills; and of deficient transportation and other infrastructure. Business investment has not risen in tandem with burgeoning corporate profits. </p><p>Instead, the profits have gone into stock buybacks, executive bonuses and dividends rather than sufficient reinvestment, slowing the pace of innovation. \"Warnings that the capital markets aren't functioning properly are everywhere,\" Mariana Mazzucato, director of the University College London's innovation institute told Fortune in December. In Canada, popular support for pharmacare and the world's first national carbon-pricing system mark a turning point. So does the growing public demand that governments rein in Big Tech and the threats it poses to personal privacy and public safety. But the swing in favour of state involvement will be most pronounced in climate crisis. The Bank of Canada and other central banks are warning with ever greater urgency that the global economic system cannot withstand the unprecedented catastrophes - what Warren Buffett calls \"super-cats\" - for which humanity must brace. A start this year will be discussions over a new state-supported global backstop for insurers, who face insolvency with the first string of claims arising from massive climate-related property damage events. Climate crisis demands a return to the model of public-private partnership that created the modern computer age, the space missions and the internet era.</p><p>Cell-based food</p><p>The current plant-based food movement is driven by concerns over healthier diets, animal welfare, and the smaller carbon footprint of plant-based foods than that of livestock. The next step, food derived from the cells of cows and poultry - or \"cellular agriculture\" - puts protein-rich meat back on the menu with no slaughterhouses and, unlike plant-based food, less use of limited fresh water and other taxes on the land imposed by plant cultivation. Plant-based meat replacements also require extraordinary processing to make them palatable, and the disagreeable taste of first-generation plant-based foods is a stigma the industry is still working to overcome. The 30 or so Canadian and global firms developing \"cultivated meat\" from animal cells, determined not to make that mistake, won't have their first products to market until 2023. But investment in lab-based meat has ramped up, increasing by 120 per cent globally last year, to $80 million, to supply a market modestly estimated at $514 million by 2030. For Canadian start-up firms in this new realm, including Edmonton's Future Fields and Appleton Meats of Vancouver, the challenge isn't the science, which is well advanced. The obstacle is a lack of venture capital for the costly equipment required in the manufacturing process. A fraction of the billions of dollars Canadians invested in the pot craze would ensure that Canadian scientists and entrepreneurs have a place in what could be the biggest revolution in food production since the advent of crop rotation. Otherwise, the new industry will be gobbled up by the same foreign-based Big Food combines that have long dominated Canadian food consumption.</p><p>The rise in renewable energy and the SUV challenge</p><p>Fortunately, coal, the dirtiest of all fuels used in electricity production, is projected to drop to 34 per cent of global power sources by decade's end, and be overtaken by renewables such as wind, solar and hydro power, accounting for 42 per cent of global electricity production by 2030. Wind power, once dismissed as an unreliable energy source, is poised to boom in 2020 and beyond. The European Union (EU), world's third-largest economy after the U.S. and China, already looks to wind for two per cent of its power generation. That percentage was recently forecast to rise ninefold by 2040 by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in its annual World Energy Outlook report in December. Companies are not only planning huge offshore wind farms in the North Sea - where energy firms can harvest stronger and steadier winds - but in offshore North America, China, Japan and South Korea, as well. That favourable trend strengthens another, the higher-than-expected adoption rate of all-electric vehicles (EVs), a record two million of which were bought last year. But against that gain for cleaner air is a surge in sport utility vehicle sales (SUVs), now accounting for 42 per cent of passenger-vehicle sales, more than double the rate in 2000. Note to investors: Pay attention to firms like oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. of Calgary that are investing heavily in wind power, wisely hedging its bets against a decline in fossil fuels; and automakers like Nissan, Hyundai and Volkswagen's Audi that lead in the electric SUV race.</p><p>A new debate about 5G's implications</p><p>The social consequences of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks will start to come under scrutiny in 2020, as 5G networks roll out in Canada over the next two years. About 10 times faster than current technology, 5G will see data moving at record speed and volume, and promises to connect every digital device, from cars to refrigerators to water-filtration-plant control rooms. The widespread misgivings that have already arisen about massive data collection will become acute. Who will set the rules on what data can be collected, and to what use it can be put? What new cybersecurity threats are we creating? That discussion will intensify this year, as the telcos pursue their goal of connecting everything digital in the country. The new technology has its virtues. As an enabler of low-cost virtual reality (VR), 5G will provide surgeons with detailed images of the patients they are treating, and tell firefighters exactly what they will encounter as they enter a burning structure. With an error rate one-thousandth that of current technology, 5G will be a blessing in \"mission critical\" applications in health care, manufacturing and transportation networks. And consumers can expect more efficient households, eHealth systems and supply chains in retailing, utilities and public safety, with 5G's ability to connect about one million digital devices per square kilometre. Yet 5G also raises the spectre of a surveillance society, with ubiquitous sensors tracking our every move. We can't allow 5G to proceed as social media have, an unregulated phenomenon whose downside caught us unprepared.</p><p>Business loses an excuse for underinvesting in Canada</p><p>Canadian businesses are expected to continue underinvesting in their enterprises in 2020, according to the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), worsening a trend that has seen Canadian corporate investment drop by about 20 per cent since the oil-price slump of 2014. Canada touts itself as an emerging high-tech superpower, given all the global firms that have set up their artificial intelligence (AI) workshops in Canada. But that's foreign capital. By contrast, Canadian firms have cut investment in intellectual property development by $532,000 per worker over the past decade, and reduced their total capex by $1,446 per worker. No wonder Canadian GDP per capita - that is, standard of living - has actually dropped three per cent from 2010 levels, a lost decade that contrasts with the 35 per cent surge in U.S. GDP per capita in that period. Business-lobby whining about unfavourable Canadian tax and regulatory conditions is nonsensical. Even before Ottawa gave business a whopping additional tax break in accelerated depreciation on capital investments, Canada was already in the highest ranks of countries for ease of doing business. And offshore investors facing those same \"unfavourable\" Canadian conditions poured $65.8 billion into Canadian investments last year, close to the record set before the oil-price collapse. The stark reality is that Canadian business has less faith in Canada than outsiders. With the likely ebbing this year of global trade tensions that Canadian business also cites for lack of enterprise, we'll see this year if judicious caution or unwarranted trepidation is the real issue here.</p><p>David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star.

(Most smart-city gear is purchased by governments.) And much of that money will be lavished on untested technologies that lack adequate cybersecurity protections.</p><p>To be sure, there are at least three certainties here.</p><p>Every proposed smart city is a \"surveillance city,\" in which ubiquitous sensors spy on residents 24/7. Smart cities will be acutely vulnerable to cyberattack. And the smart-city movement is driven not by the public, but by what can be called the \"urban-industrial complex\" (UIC).</p><p>The UIC is a partnership of Big Tech and government to spend an estimated $158 billion (U.S.) per year on smart-city makeovers by 2022. That amounts to a colossal $1.6 trillion over the following decade. (All figures in U.S. dollars.)</p><p>The UIC's Big Tech members include Bell Canada and Telus Corp. here at home, as well as foreign tech giants IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co., Intel Corp., Siemens AG, Cisco Systems Inc. and Huawei Technologies Inc., among others.</p><p>For some, Big Tech's self-appointed role in designing cities is a concern.</p><p>We \"need to ensure that governments, as opposed to private companies, are in the lead in governing 'smart city' projects,\" Sara Bannerman, Canada Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University, told the Star.</p><p>Among recommendations in a draft report on smart cities that Bannerman recently co-authored are a minimization of surveillance technologies in smart-city projects, and provisions enabling Canadians to view, correct and delete data collected on them.</p><p>Like other countries, Canada and the U.S. are also running smart city competitions. Those initiatives can be lauded for generating grassroots ideas.</p><p>But most of the smart city decision-making is top-down. It is Big Tech and its government partners trying to impose radical change on urban life worldwide.</p><p>The enthusiasm about smart cities needs to be curbed. Here are some reasons why.</p><p>They're all or nothing.</p><p>The smart-city concept doesn't work unless everything and everyone in the city is digitally connected.</p><p>As the smart-city advocates see it, there is no such thing as a smart-city building. If we're serious about using this new orthodoxy to create an urbanity of unprecedented efficiency, all buildings, infrastructure and people must be digitally equipped and interconnected.</p><p>Only by that means can \"interoperability\" be achieved among police, public transit, power and water utilities, education, health care and ATM machines, all of them collecting and sharing data to make the city safer and more efficient.</p><p>Because all that data is interconnected in a smart city, somebody somewhere will know the route you take in picking up your kids from school, your state of health, and how you spend your money.</p><p>Mere pilot projects don't work in this area.</p><p>No sooner had Google unveiled its master plan for Quayside, on June 24, than it demanded much more land than it was allotted to make its project viable. Even then, the Sidewalk Labs project is just a gimmick unless the entire GTA remakes itself according to Google's plan for Quayside.</p><p>\"Smart Cities are Going to be a Security Nightmare.\"</p><p>That's how the Harvard Business Review, a journal not given to alarmism, has described just one smart-city challenge.</p><p>And it's true that when you connect a city's public services, transportation, utilities, financial institutions and retailers into a digitalized whole, you are giving hackers the chance to inflict multiple, simultaneous system failures.</p><p>Or, as Todd Thibodeaux, head of CompTIA, one of America's biggest IT trade associations, has put it, a determined hacker, in compromising just one system, can \"shut down multiple city services from a single entry point.\"</p><p>We'll neglect nondigital priorities.</p><p>There are urban crises that do not lend themselves to a high-tech solution. At least not yet.</p><p>Those include shortages of affordable housing, child poverty, income inequality, gang violence, spousal and elder abuse, substance addiction, and the gender-pay gap.</p><p>The annual Smart City Index (SCI) doesn't measure those things in ranking the world's smartest cities. The major indexes of the world's most livable cities do. Only one city, Melbourne, ranks in the top 10 on both the SCI and most livable city indices.</p><p>The SCI looks at the rate of digital, or cashless, payments in a city; digital traffic-control systems; digital provision of health services, and digital systems for detecting areas of high crime. At least so far, the \"smartest\" cities aren't the most livable ones. And that's after almost a decade of implementing smart city ideas.</p><p>Smart city innovations should be encouraged, as there is proof that in selected applications they work. Toronto is now using digital sensors on civic vehicles to fix them before they break down, and on sewer pipes to more quickly detect leaks.</p><p>The grandiose vision of smart-city champions, who walk away from any challenge that doesn't have a digital solution, threatens to distract us from practical measures.</p><p>For instance, if Toronto had an urban planning function worthy of the name, the city wouldn't be walled off from Lake Ontario by look-alike luxury condo towers.</p><p>And if three levels of government could agree on a world-class transportation system for Toronto, and release more than $20 billion designated for that purpose, we could solve a problem without handing Big Tech a billion-dollar payday. The same applies in the crisis of affordable housing. And a digital utopia is not required to get serious about energy-efficient retrofits of our buildings, one of the greatest blows we can strike in the fight against global warming.</p><p>We're faced with a tradeoff.</p><p>In effect, residents of cities that are candidates to be completely digitized are being asked to surrender their privacy and tax dollars so that a driver on the DVP can adjust the chlorine levels of his swimming pool with his smartphone.</p><p>We don't need smart cities. We need sensible cities, where such moronic trade-offs are laughed out of the room.</p><p>David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is in North Korea for the next two days to meet with Kim Jong Un, perhaps in preparation for the upcoming G20.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[10:30:26] POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR, NEWSROOM: All right, welcome back. So prosecutors in the Dominican Republic now say that a gunman that, you know, shot David Ortiz, actually meant to shoot his friend, not the baseball legend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That friend was sitting at the table with Ortiz, outside on this patio, wearing similar clothes. Our Patrick Oppmann is in Santo Domingo this morning with more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Maybe they were wearing similar clothes, but these guys could not look more different. Not to mention Big Papi David Ortiz is the most famous person in the D.R.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, he is. He's 6'3\", he's 250 pounds, he's got shoulders twice or three times as wide as mine. You can't miss this guy. Everyone knows who he is. He is the ultimate hometown hero.</p><p>And let's introduce you to the other person. Because you probably haven't heard of him, and no one has heard of him here either. So over here, we have Big Papi. He was shot, of course, as we know. And over here, we have his friend, Sixto Fernandez. He was the target. And somehow, the gunman, who was supposed to shoot this man, shoots Big Papi instead.</p><p>And on top of that, just to make it even more incredible -- because of course the gunman, we see him walk in, walk directly over to Big Papi and shoot him in the back -- but there was, according to police, an alleged spotter, somebody who was in the bar for hours, relaying what was going on, the arrivals, comings and the goings.</p><p>And after the shooting, he stays there. He's very calm, he's very collected. And there's really no reaction from him. That's really not the reaction you might expect if a hit went terribly wrong --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>OPPMANN: -- so that is what the video shows us. But police say it actually is a very different picture, and that they have the story now worked out and it's not what they have been telling us. Big Papi was never the target. HARLOW: Wow. OK. We did not know and expected this twist. Patrick Oppmann, thank you for the great reporting on the ground there, throughout.</p><p>Let's talk about this with former FBI supervisory special agent and CNN law enforcement analyst, James Gagliano.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>JAMES GAGLIANO, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You buy this?</p><p>GAGLIANO: Well, it would defy credulity if you looked at it just from the outside, looking in. You say, \"Big Papi is a -- not just a national hero in the Dominican Republic, a world figure.\"</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>GAGLIANO: But I look at it like this. You've got to have a scorecard to keep track of all the players. There are 14 people --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>GAGLIANO: -- that police, the attorney general in the Dominican Republic and the director of the police services have suggested are part of this conspiracy. Eleven are in custody, Poppy. Three are still at large.</p><p>You take 11 individuals you bring into custody, you separate them, you interrogate or interview them. Any falsehoods in a story is going to fall apart. The fact that the police and the attorney general feel confident about this, that tells me they may have -- there may be more there, but it may be a plausible theory.</p><p>HARLOW: They also felt confident about their assertion two days ago --</p><p>GAGLIANO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- that (ph) was a court document. So it was a totally different story. But I hear you. So you mentioned these 14 individuals, right?</p><p>GAGLIANO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You've got 11 of them apprehended so far, three on the run. One of them in the U.S., the DEA is looking for.</p><p>GAGLIANO: Right. So let's -- we got this scorecard here. So we know that the police are suggesting in the Dominican Republic, that Mr. Fernandez, Sixto Fernandez, is the cousin of a guy that's wanted by the DEA in the United States, a man by the name of Victor Hugo Gomez. Now, apparently, the cousin, Fernandez, had, in the street parlance, had ratted him out to officials before, in 2011. This is now a huge web between the two countries because it involves people in prison talking to people in prison in the Dominican Republic, talking to people on the streets in the United States and streets in the D.R.</p><p>The fact that 14 people were part of this tells me that this was a haphazard, poorly planned assassination attempt. I've seen Latin American assassination attempts. The way that this went down, it almost looked like something out of the Keystone Cops. And the fact that you'd have 14 people involved in something you'd want to keep close hold --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>GAGLIANO: -- makes no sense.</p><p>HARLOW: Why would you do that. OK. Thank you for your expertise. Thank you for the scorecard, my friend.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: That's a good way to do it. James Gagliano, we appreciate it.</p><p>[10:34:37] Still ahead, the FBI stops a terror plot, a plot to bomb a church in Pittsburgh. We will have details of the Syrian refugee accused of planning this attack, and his alleged link to ISIS, ahead.</p><p>HARLOW: A really significant development. A Syrian refugee is behind bars this morning, accused of plotting an attack on a Pittsburgh church in the name of ISIS.</p><p>The FBI has arrested the 21-year-old man. They made this arrest just yesterday, and court records show that he bought bomb-making materials and had a multipoint plan for the attack. The thwarted attack comes less than eight months after a shooter opened fire on that synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 people in that city.</p><p>Our crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz is with me now.</p><p>I mean, ugh, for this to happen anywhere, and especially in Pittsburgh after the synagogue was attacked --</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes.</p><p>[10:40:01] HARLOW: -- how -- I mean, what alerted them to this?</p><p>PROKUPECZ: So this is a person who's been on the FBI's radar, it seems, according to the court records, since April of 2018. The FBI first located him through social media. There was a posting on social media and they found him that way.</p><p>So this is someone that they've known and they've probably monitored for, now, over a year. And what led them to him was there was a post on his social media back in April, saying that he wanted to die by blowing himself up. And so the FBI was like, \"OK, well this guy looks -- seems like someone who would -- could be a problem for us.\"</p><p>And then really, it wasn't until this year, in March of this year, that the plan and the plot to bomb this tiny church --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- in Pittsburgh started unfolding. They used an undercover, they had an informant, the FBI did. So it was a controlled -- what we see in a lot of these cases, a controlled operation.</p><p>Recently as just a few days ago, he went and bought nails for his bomb-making, for his bombs.</p><p>So I think for us -- so what's important here is, though, while, you know, ISIS, right? This -- and ISIS sympathizers --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- it seems, you would think, we are not seeing the same number of arrests or cases out there like we did at one time.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: However, it's still very much a concern for the FBI. And we can see that. They're still monitoring folks, this guy came here in 2016. It was a Syrian refugee.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: It's a concern, still, and an ongoing concern.</p><p>HARLOW: And I think it also speaks, right? To the power and strength of recruitment that ISIS maintains despite its caliphate --</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: -- being so shrinked, if not wiped out.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Right. And that's social media and YouTube and other places --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: You know, we still see cases involving other clerics (ph), right? Other terrorists, folks that the government has killed even, has arrested, their message lives on forever. And this is going to be a problem that is going to go on forever. And that's why the FBI still runs a pretty robust --</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- operation to try and prevent these guys --</p><p>HARLOW: Because you can't contain an ideology, right?</p><p>PROKUPECZ: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: You can wipe them out on the ground, which the Trump administration has been successful in doing that to a large extent. But then the FBI's real challenge here, right? Is attacking the mentality --</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: -- and what got them there.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Right. And it's finding them on social media, and also going back to, let's say, this person fell on their radar, came on their radar in 2018. They still worked it. They still monitored this person, they didn't let this person out of their sight. And it was just a couple of months ago, that they started introducing informants and undercover (ph) --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: Do they think it was -- do you know, Shimon, a network of people? Or was this one isolated individual?</p><p>PROKUPECZ: So they do believe that it is an isolated incident or situation. However, what's interesting is that he was communicating with someone else that the FBI was monitoring, that was also an ISIS sympathizer and was distributing bomb-making material and also trying to call for other people to do these kinds of attacks.</p><p>TEXT: Syrian Refugee Arrested in Pittsburgh, Accused of Planning to Bomb Church: 21-year-old Mustafa Mousab Alowemer; Allegedly bought bomb-making materials; Allegedly communicated with ISIS supporter; Allegedly had 10-point plan for the attack</p><p>PROKUPECZ: So while it is an isolated individual and he's not part of a network --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- in a way, he still is. It's a larger network, it's a network of ISIS sympathizers --</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- that he was communicating with, that also, the FBI was able to monitor.</p><p>HARLOW: OK. Shimon, great reporting.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Sure. Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>All right. Ahead for us, Kim Jong Un meeting with China's president, Xi Jinping. This meeting in North Korea, so that is historic and significant. It's a major meeting between these two world leaders. But one other person, very much on their minds. And that is President Trump. All of this, ahead of the G20. Stay with us.</p><p>[10:48:18] HARLOW: Chinese President Xi Jinping is in North Korea right now. This is a two-day meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. And this morning, the two reportedly discussed, quote, \"a new era of relations between the two nations.\"</p><p>Of course, this summit marks the first state visit from a Chinese leader there in North Korea in 14 years. But U.S. officials reportedly see this summit as an attempt to leverage President Trump, all of this ahead of the G20. We'll get to that in a moment but let's go to our correspondent Will Ripley. He joins me from Beijing.</p><p>Of course, Will, you're the only journalist who's gotten so much access inside of North Korea. So just give us a sense of how significant it is that Xi Jinping is there right now.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you look at the pictures that have come in, Poppy. Kim Jong Un claimed that there were more than a quarter million people lining the streets of Pyongyang to welcome Xi Jinping. No country knows how to make a strongman feel welcome like North Korea. He got the parade, he got the crowd shouting his name.</p><p>Kim wants to flatter Xi because Kim needs something from Xi. He needs sanctions relief. He needs China to look the other way when oil shipments are illegally transferred at the High Seas. And he needs China to, perhaps, slow down some of the enforcement, the borders, of items that are being smuggled across. And he needs security guarantees as well.</p><p>What does Xi need from Kim? He needs North Korea to remain stable and to remain allied with China and not the United States. You know, every time that President Trump has met with Kim Jong Un, he -- you know, Kim met with Xi first, which hints that maybe there's another Trump-Kim meeting coming sometime in the near future --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>RIPLEY: -- of course, the United States has been hinting about that as well.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, that's true. Pompeo said a few weeks ago, they'd be open to a third summit. But can you talk just about sort of the politics of all of this and the significance of the timing here?</p><p>[10:50:01] This is right before the G20, right after the president says he had a very good and productive phone call with Xi Jinping. What's the deal here with the global politics and what this might mean for President Trump?</p><p>RIPLEY: This timing is definitely not a coincidence. That Xi is doing this a matter of days before he's expected to meet with Trump on the sidelines of the G20. Because Xi wants to remind Trump that he's an important player here, that he can be an intermediary with the North Koreans. But he wants something in return, which is not -- you know, not for the U.S. to slap $300 billion in Chinese goods with new tariffs. And he wants the negotiations in the trade war to continue.</p><p>So if Xi can leave North Korea with something that he can bring to Trump when they're expected to have that chat in Japan, something useful for Trump -- North Korea's one of the president's key foreign policy issues -- well then, Xi wins, Trump could -- you know, could win as well.</p><p>But everybody is doing this -- all this friendship, the smiling here -- but it's all strategic, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Of course it is. Will Ripley, thank you for the reporting.</p><p>Ahead for us, YouTube reportedly considering some pretty significant changes to the way that it handles videos that your children watch. Why? What might change and what motivated this move? Ahead.</p><p>[10:55:39] HARLOW: All right, welcome back. So despite growing fears of a recession, the head of one of the nation's biggest banks says a recession is not in the cards. CNN's (ph) lead writer (INAUDIBLE) just sat down for an exclusive interview with the CEO of Bank of America, who thinks the chances of a recession are not going up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: People talk about recession, they confuse it with slowing down. The economy was predicted by everybody last year to slow down. There was nobody saying that '19 was going to be bigger than '18, including ourselves. That's coming true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: That's reassuring. Moynihan's comments come as stocks sit near record levels, but a recent survey by Duke University of chief financial officers in this country, found seven in 10 of them think a recession will hit the United States by the end of next year.</p><p>All right. This morning, YouTube is weighing some major changes to the way that it handles content for children. It's part of the company's response to criticism that it just hasn't done enough to keep those offensive videos away from minors.</p><p>In fact, \"The Washington Post\" reports the FTC is in the late stages of an investigation into how YouTube is handling these children's videos. Our Brian Fung has reporting on this story. He joins me now.</p><p>So the parent company, Google, is apparently considering moving all children's content to the standalone YouTube app -- the standalone YouTube Kids app, which would change things dramatically. BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: It would potentially. You know, YouTube obviously relies heavily upon driving engagement, getting people to watch move videos more frequently.</p><p>And so by diverting some of that content off to its own individual silo, it could, you know, potentially reduce that engagement, which would be harmful for YouTube's bottom line.</p><p>But a person familiar with the matter has told me that would be a really drastic step and it's unlikely that YouTube would actually move in that direction. What's more likely, you know, YouTube has considered internally, things like stopping the practice where it automatically plays the next video in the queue, which could, you know, potentially cut down on instances where, you know, your kid might be watching a very innocuous video one moment, and then at the next moment, be watching a very harmful or disturbing video.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. I mean, we were talking in the break -- it happened to my three-year-old this week. A video she should definitely not have been watching popped up after I turned on \"Mister Rogers.\"</p><p>The issue is, YouTube has hired 10,000 people to get around this issue. And the Google CEO just told me, a week ago, \"We're doing better and better but, you know, it's really hard to get a hundred percent of these videos that shouldn't be there, down.\"</p><p>What is sort of the long play here? Is A.I., is technology going to be able to fix the algorithm and the recommendation algorithm on this?</p><p>FUNG: Well, I think, you know, Sundar Pichai does have a point. It's a very hard technological problem. Just, you know, it's an immense amount of scale that you'd have to throw at this issue because there are hours upon hours being uploaded to YouTube every day, and there just aren't enough humans who can, you know, turn their attention to, you know, validating all of this content.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>FUNG: So at some level, part of the -- part of the solution is going to be technological. But I think one of the things that regulators are really grappling with is what types of policies would YouTube have to put in place or what types of policies government regulators might have to put in place --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>FUNG: -- to ensure this content remains, you know, appropriate for children.</p><p>HARLOW: And speaking of government regulators, right? There is now this top-to-bottom House probe of --</p><p>FUNG: That's right.</p><p>HARLOW: -- Google and its Big Tech competitors. Is this going to be part of that? Because many would argue that Congress completely has abdicated its duty to regulate these guys. And by the way, Google wants more regulation.</p><p>FUNG: Well, I think this House antitrust subcommittee probe is sort of designed at addressing some of these big societal challenges. This is the first time the antitrust subcommittee has done something like this in decades. So they're really interested in going broad and deep on some of these questions.</p><p>You know, at the same time, this is a bit of a Rorschach test because, you know, Congress is looking at it from a very different perspective than the antitrust agencies might be looking at it.</p><p>HARLOW: That's true, that's true. OK. We'll keep following this. Great reporting, Brian.</p><p>FUNG: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you very much. We appreciate it.</p><p>[10:59:57] And thank you for being with us. I'm Poppy Harlow. \"AT THIS HOUR\" starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
