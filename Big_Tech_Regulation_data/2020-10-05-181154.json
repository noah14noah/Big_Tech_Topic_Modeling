Yet this massive private surveillance dragnet is largely beyond Americans' control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until now. On Jan.1, a landmark law in California will grant consumers the right to see the personal information that companies collect about them and stop them from selling it. The law is the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If companies extend these new rights to consumers outside the state, or if other states follow California's lead, the CCPA could effectively become a national law, privacy advocates say.</p><p>But the law, which takes effect next week, faces challenges.</p><p>Business trade groups and lobbyists are seeking to revise it with amendments or preempt it with watered-down federal legislation, claiming the regulations are overly broad and could have unintended consequences that harm consumers and small businesses.</p><p>Bay Area real estate developer turned privacy activist Alastair Mactaggart, who put up more than $3million to place privacy protections before California voters in 2018, says he isn't backing down from his fight to give consumers more control over how Silicon Valley tracks them to target advertising. The statewide ballot initiative he funded drew more than 600,000 signatures, leading California lawmakers, tech companies and privacy advocates to hammer out a legislative compromise: the CCPA.</p><p>\"Whether or not we have everything in this particular law or the next one, it's a massive beachhead,\" Mactaggart says. \"Being California, we just have a unique opportunity. As we go, so goes the nation.\"</p><p>With calls for privacy regulation from Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail intensifying, Mactaggart is capitalizing on a growing unease with the tech industry's business tactics post-Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He says he's prepared to spend millions more on a new initiative for the 2020 ballot in California to keep business interests from chipping away at the CCPA. The ballot initiative would also protect sensitive information, like your health and financial records, and your precise location. And it would create a California agency to enforce the regulations.</p><p>But Jennifer King, director of consumer privacy at the Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, says the law may not help as many people as supporters hope.</p><p>\"I'm skeptical that the average person will even know this law exists, let alone know how to take advantage of it. Mostly I imagine that privacy advocates will put it to the test and publicize the results,\" she says. \"One of my concerns is that there is no budget allocated to public education on the issue, so most people are going to learn about it via word of mouth from advocates or friends. And, depending on how hard it is to exercise one's rights from company to company, and what results you receive in turn, individual experiences may vary a lot.\"</p><p>Want to take more control over your online data? Here's what you need to know:</p><p>What is the California Consumer Privacy Act?</p><p>California consumers have already begun to receive email notifications alerting them to changes under CCPA.</p><p>The law, which takes effect Jan.1, gives California residents the right to know what data companies collect about them and to opt out of having their data sold. Businesses are also restricted in selling the personal information of children under 16.</p><p>Under the law, Californians can sue businesses for certain types of data breaches. For other violations, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will be able to bring enforcement actions starting in July. The regulations used to enforce the law are still being finalized.</p><p>What's the catch?</p><p>CCPA may be the nation's strongest privacy law, but privacy advocates warn it has limitations and the business community says it has drawbacks.</p><p>The law still puts the onus on consumers to take steps to protect their data. The problem: Americans trade away their privacy all the time. We click through privacy policies and terms of service without reading them. We buy phones that track us everywhere we go. We use smart speakers that record us in our homes. We take quizzes that give up intimate details about our lives.</p><p>Even if people want to assert their privacy rights, many don't know what those are, and the law will have little impact unless people use it, advocates say. Some 63% of Americans say they understand very little or nothing at all about the laws and regulations that protect the privacy of their data, Pew Research found.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly how the law will apply to major tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue they do not sell the information of consumers they track on the internet. \"In our case there's nothing to opt out from,\" Facebook said in a statement. Becerra is expected to offer more guidance on this issue in 2020.</p><p>If a business violates the law, it can be fined $2,500 per violation or $7,500 if the violation is determined to be intentional. But consumers have little recourse on their own except for data breaches. For the most part, they cannot sue companies that violate the law. Only Becerra can enforce the rules when companies don't respond to consumers' requests or delete their data.</p><p>\"We have a law that effectively makes the California Attorney General the chief privacy officer without the budget to do that,\" says Electronic Privacy Information Center associate director Mary Stone Ross, who helped draft the ballot initiative that led to the California law. \"It makes me nervous that some businesses are just going to take their chances.\"</p><p>What if I don't live in California?</p><p>In response to the upcoming law, some corporations like Microsoft are extending California's consumer protections to all Americans. Privacy advocates are betting other companies will follow suit. So they are urging consumers across the country to demand that companies delete their data and stop stockpiling it.</p><p>Many companies are expected to comply with these requests.</p><p>\"Whether you are in California or not, you should take advantage of this great law,\" says Girard Kelly, counsel and director of the privacy program at Common Sense Media, the nonprofit advocacy group that helped draft the legislation. \"Know what companies are collecting about you. Know how it's being used, whether they are selling it, and, if they are selling it, know that you can opt out and say 'No, I don't want you to try to make money from my data.'\"</p><p>How do I exercise my privacy rights?</p><p>So, if you stream a lot of music on Spotify, you can send a form to the company directing the company not to sell your data. If your teen uses TikTok, you can send a form on your teen's behalf. A business must comply unless the information is necessary to complete a transaction or protect against fraud.</p><p>For instance, Hulu informs Californians that it collects all sorts of information, such as age, gender, IP address and viewing habits and makes inferences about you to recommend more programming.</p><p>You can opt out of having your information shared with advertisers including geolocation data and the insights Hulu gleans. But if you ask Hulu to delete all the information it collects about you, the streaming company warns it will have to cancel and delete your account.</p><p>In general there are two steps:</p><p>Fill out forms - one form per person, per company - to request your information, to have your information deleted or to instruct a company not to sell your information. Each form should take five to 10 minutes to complete.</p><p>Then file your forms electronically or by mail.</p><p>Common Sense Media has free resources for consumers including instructions on how to exercise your rights and the forms you need to request a company delete your personal information.</p><p>You can expect to get confirmation of your request to see your information and have your information deleted within 10 days. Businesses are supposed to send a response to that request within 45 days. You can request your personal information from businesses twice a year for free. The information they provide will go back 12 months.</p><p>Which businesses have to comply with the law?</p><p>It's not just big tech. Broadly speaking, most companies, no matter where they are based, must comply with the CCPA when serving California customers.</p><p>The law exempts some small businesses. It applies only to companies with at least $25million in revenue, personal information on at least 50,000 people or which generate at least half their money from selling consumers' personal information.</p><p>Why do businesses oppose the law?</p><p>Business interests complain the regulations are an overreaction to troubling revelations from the tech industry, such as Facebook's handling of user data, and place unfair burdens on small businesses that are not exempt and could deprive consumers of loyalty and rewards programs.</p><p>For example, businesses complain that the new California law broadens the definition of personal information to any information, including a specific device or browser that could be linked directly or indirectly to a consumer or household.</p><p>These interests are pushing California lawmakers to water down the law and Congress to pass federal legislation that would preempt it.</p><p>\"There may yet be unintended consequences to small businesses and consumers that can affect access to data, apps, advertising, and software tools,\" says Shoeb Mohammed, policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>How did California get a privacy law?</p><p>Mactaggart was chatting at a party with a Google engineer who confided that Americans would be horrified by how much Google knew about them.</p><p>In 2018, the real estate developer gathered signatures to put a privacy initiative on the California ballot. Tech companies put up $1million to fight the measure before backing off.</p><p>Mactaggart agreed to take the measure off the ballot if the California legislature passed a data privacy law, which it did.</p><p>That is the law that takes effect Wednesday.</p><p>Throughout 2019, tech companies worked to weaken the law before it takes effect and privacy advocates worked to strengthen it. So far, there have not been any significant changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will enforce the state's new privacy law.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Rich Pedroncelli/ap</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESSUN-plm-2087917226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESSUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVW-DG91-DYJJ-P21X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Desert Sun All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Desert Sun (Palm Springs, California)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Yet this massive private surveillance dragnet is largely beyond Americans' control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Until now. On Jan.1, a landmark law in California will grant consumers the right to see the personal information that companies collect about them and stop them from selling it and empower California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to bring enforcement actions. The law is the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If companies extend these new rights to consumers outside the state, or if other states follow California's lead, the CCPA could effectively become a national law, privacy advocates say.</p><p>But the law, which takes effect next week, faces challenges. Business trade groups and lobbyists are seeking to revise it with amendments or preempt it with watered-down federal legislation, claiming the regulations are overly broad and could have unintended consequences that harm consumers and small businesses.</p><p>Bay Area real estate developer turned privacy activist Alastair Mactaggart, who put up more than $3million to place privacy protections before California voters in 2018, says he isn't backing down from his fight to give consumers more control over how Silicon Valley tracks them to target advertising. The statewide ballot initiative he funded drew more than 600,000 signatures, leading California lawmakers, tech companies and privacy advocates to hammer out a legislative compromise: the CCPA.</p><p>\"Whether or not we have everything in this particular law or the next one, it's a massive beachhead,\" Mactaggart says. \"Being California, we just have a unique opportunity. As we go, so goes the nation.\"</p><p>With calls for privacy regulation from Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail intensifying, Mactaggart is capitalizing on a growing unease with the tech industry's business tactics post-Cambridge Analytica. He says he's prepared to spend millions more on a new initiative for the 2020 ballot in California to keep business interests from chipping away at the CCPA. The ballot initiative would also protect sensitive information, like your health and financial records, and your precise location. And it would create a California agency to enforce the regulations.</p><p>But Jennifer King, director of consumer privacy at the Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, says the law may not help as many people as some hope.</p><p>\"I'm skeptical that the average person will even know this law exists, let alone know how to take advantage of it. Mostly I imagine that privacy advocates will put it to the test and publicize the results,\" she says. \"One of my concerns is that there is no budget allocated to public education on the issue, so most people are going to learn about it via word of mouth from advocates or friends. And, depending on how hard it is to exercise one's rights from company to company, and what results you receive in turn, individual experiences may vary a lot.\"</p><p>Want to take more control over your online data? Here's what you need to know.</p><p>What is the law?</p><p>California consumers have already begun to receive email notifications alerting them to changes under CCPA.</p><p>The law, which takes effect Jan.1, gives California residents the right to know what data companies collect about them and to opt out of having their data sold. Businesses are also restricted in selling the personal information of children under 16.</p><p>Under the law, Californians can sue businesses for certain types of data breaches. For other violations, Becerra will be able to bring enforcement actions starting in July. The regulations used to enforce the law are still being finalized.</p><p>What's</p><p>the catch?</p><p>CCPA may be the nation's strongest privacy law, but privacy advocates warn it has limitations and the business community says it has drawbacks.</p><p>The law still puts the onus on consumers to take steps to protect their data. The problem: Americans trade away their privacy all the time. We click through privacy policies and terms of service without reading them. We buy phones that track us everywhere we go. We use smart speakers that record us in our homes. We take quizzes that give up intimate details about our lives.</p><p>Even if people want to assert their privacy rights, many don't know what those are, and the law will have little impact unless people use it, advocates say. Some 63% of Americans say they understand very little or nothing at all about the laws and regulations that protect the privacy of their data, Pew Research found.</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly how the law will apply to major tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue they do not sell the information of consumers they track on the internet. \"In our case there's nothing to opt out from,\" Facebook said in a statement. Becerra is expected to offer more guidance on this issue in 2020.</p><p>If a business violates the law, it can be fined $2,500 per violation or $7,500 if the violation is determined to be intentional. But consumers have little recourse on their own except for data breaches. For the most part, they cannot sue companies that violate the law. Only Becerra can enforce the rules when companies don't respond to consumers' requests or delete their data.</p><p>\"We have a law that effectively makes the California Attorney General the chief privacy officer without the budget to do that,\" says Electronic Privacy Information Center associate director Mary Stone Ross, who helped draft the ballot initiative that led to the California law. \"It makes me nervous that some businesses are just going to take their chances.\"</p><p>What about those who don't live here?</p><p>In response to the upcoming law, some corporations like Microsoft are extending California's consumer protections to all Americans. Privacy advocates are betting other companies will follow suit. So they are urging consumers across the country to demand that companies delete their data and stop stockpiling it. Many companies are expected to comply with these requests.</p><p>\"Whether you are in California or not, you should take advantage of this great law,\" says Girard Kelly, counsel and director of the privacy program at Common Sense Media, the nonprofit advocacy group that helped draft the legislation. \"Know what companies are collecting about you. Know how it's being used, whether they are selling it, and, if they are selling it, know that you can opt out and say 'No, I don't want you to try to make money from my data.'\"</p><p>How do I exercise</p><p>my privacy rights?</p><p>So, if you stream a lot of music on Spotify, you can send a form to the company directing the company not to sell your data. If your teen uses TikTok, you can send a form on your teen's behalf. A business must comply unless the information is necessary to complete a transaction or protect against fraud.</p><p>For instance, Hulu informs Californians that it collects all sorts of information, such as age, gender, IP address and viewing habits and makes inferences about you to recommend more programming.</p><p>You can opt out of having your information shared with advertisers including geolocation data and the insights Hulu gleans. But if you ask Hulu to delete all the information it collects about you, the streaming company warns it will have to cancel and delete your account.</p><p>In general there are two steps:</p><p>Fill out forms - one form per person, per company - to request your information, to have your information deleted or to instruct a company not to sell your information. Each form should take five to 10 minutes to complete.</p><p>Then file your forms electronically or by mail.</p><p>Common Sense Media has free resources for consumers including instructions on how to exercise your rights and the forms you need to request a company delete your personal information.</p><p>You can expect to get confirmation of your request to see your information and have your information deleted within 10 days. Businesses are supposed to send a response to that request within 45 days.</p><p>You can request your personal information from businesses twice a year for free.</p><p>The information they provide will go back 12 months.</p><p>Which businesses have to comply</p><p>with the law?</p><p>It's not just big tech. Broadly speaking, most companies, no matter where they are based, must comply with the CCPA when serving California customers.</p><p>The law exempts some small businesses. It applies only to companies with at least $25million in revenue, personal information on at least 50,000 people or which generate at least half their money from selling consumers' personal information.</p><p>Why do businesses oppose the law?</p><p>Business interests complain the regulations are an overreaction to troubling revelations from the tech industry, such as Facebook's handling of user data, and place unfair burdens on small businesses that are not exempt and could deprive consumers of loyalty and rewards programs.</p><p>For example, businesses complain that the new California law broadens the definition of personal information to any information, including a specific device or browser that could be linked directly or indirectly to a consumer or household.</p><p>These interests are pushing California lawmakers to water down the law and Congress to pass federal legislation that would preempt it.</p><p>\"There may yet be unintended consequences to small businesses and consumers that can affect access to data, apps, advertising, and software tools,\" says Shoeb Mohammed, policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>How did California</p><p>get a privacy law?</p><p>Mactaggart was chatting at a party with a Google engineer who confided that Americans would be horrified by how much Google knew about them.</p><p>In 2018, the real estate developer gathered signatures to put a privacy initiative on the California ballot. Tech companies put up $1million to fight the measure before backing off. Mactaggart agreed to take the measure off the ballot if the California legislature passed a data privacy law, which it did. That is the law that takes effect Wednesday.</p><p>What's next for privacy in California?</p><p>Mactaggart is working on the new ballot initiative. In California, these initiatives bypass the state legislature and the governor to create new laws.</p><p>If approved by voters, Mactaggart's measure would limit the sale of sensitive information such as sexual orientation and race; require that companies only collect as much information as is necessary for business purposes and inform consumers how long they intend to hold onto it; and would impose tougher penalties for violations involving children under age 16.</p><p>What are the privacy laws elsewhere?</p><p>Federal privacy legislation is stuck in Congress.</p><p>No other states have adopted California's privacy regulations, though some are exploring similar laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VENCST-vcs-2087649274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VENCST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVF-FWG1-DYJJ-P05N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162800</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Ventura County Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ventura County Star</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 28, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

We'll have the latest on that in just a  minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But, first tonight, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg went on  television yesterday and the news world ground to a halt.  Nothing else  happened.  Americans stopped dying of drug ODs, the world's post-war order  stopped collapsing, robots stopped taking our jobs, the borders were secure  because for most of the day, all that mattered was Sam Nunberg.  Watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, \" ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\":  Good evening.  I'm Erin  Burnett, \"OutFront\".  Tonight, breaking news.  Defiant and speaking out,  Trump's former campaign aide Sam Nunberg refusing to comply with a grand  jury subpoena in the Russia investigation.</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN HOST, \"CNN TONIGHT\":  This is exactly what the White House  did not want to hear.  So, you have to wonder, what does Sam Nunberg really  know.</p><p> WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, \"SITUATION ROOM\":  Perhaps unprecedented comments  from a former Trump campaign aide who says he's been subpoenaed.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the history of American news media, we have never  witnessed anything like this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Who writes news copy?  Russian bots, non-English speakers for  sure.  Sam Nunberg speaking out.</p><p> Who is Sam Nunberg exactly?  Well, I'll tell you.  Just yesterday, he was a  pretty obscure part-time political consultant from New York City, who has  apparently been struggling with a substance abuse problem.</p><p> He's actually a pretty nice guy, but you have probably never heard of him.   Almost nobody had heard of him.  And now, the media are telling you that  Nunberg could be the key to this whole scandal.  The John Dean of this fake  Watergate.  Except that, unlike John Dean, Nunberg was nowhere near the  decisions when they were made.</p><p> He worked at a low level of the Trump campaign before it was actually a  campaign.  He left almost a year-and-a-half before the election.  If there  was indeed a Russia conspiracy, Sam Nunberg would not know anything about  it.</p><p> More likely, what was going on yesterday, Nunberg brilliantly played the  press because it turns out, this Friday, he's talking to Robert Mueller's  investigators, which is yet another measure of how absurd this independent  counsel investigation is, if you're talking to Sam Nunberg.</p><p> Others, though, have been charged with perjury after doing interviews with  Mueller's investigators.  Nunberg will not be.  Why?  Because he just  admitted in public to being an alcoholic and then acted like a lunatic on  television for hours.</p><p> It is the perfect preemptive insanity defense.  Mueller can't indict him.   After yesterday, no jury would convict Sam Nunberg.  Was that Nunberg's  plan?  Well, we don't know really.  But if it was, none of the people  interviewing him yesterday would have figured it out because there's nobody  dumber than most cable news hosts at \"CNN\" and \"MSNBC\".</p><p> How dumb?  Well, dumb enough to see Russian saboteurs under every bed.   Russia, the place, the actual country, is grim and hopeless.  It's got a  lower than replacement birth date.  It's got waning power on the world  stage.  It has one military base outside its borders.  It's not a major  player anymore.  </p><p> But the imaginary Russia, the one you see on television every night, has  never been more powerful.  At the DNC and \"NBC News\", Vladimir Putin is  diabolical and omnipotent.  Putin put Trump in office.  He gave the Senate  nomination in Alabama to Roy Moore somehow.  He empowered the NRA.  He  likely handpicked seasoned masters of espionage like Sam Nunberg and Carter  Page to undermine our democracy.</p><p> It's delusional, but they fervently believe it.  Meanwhile back in the real  world, evidence mounts that the actual problem is not the Russians or  Vladimir Putin, it is the corrupt and decadent and resolutely stupid  leadership of our own elites.</p><p> That is why Trump got elected, in reaction to them.  That's why the  European Union is in the process of collapsing.</p><p> Just this weekend, in Italy, while we're all talking about Sam Nunberg, the  ruling party there was crushed, while antiestablishment candidates won big.   Voters, the polls showed, were deeply unhappy with economic policies that  have enriched a few, while stealing the future from young people.</p><p> They hated the immigration policies that have crushed their national  culture under waves of migrants.  Sound familiar?  Well, there, as here,  the elites have failed.</p><p> But they can't admit that?  They can't face their own failure.  So,  instead, they blame the unseen hand of Russia.</p><p> Former Obama official Samantha Power actually said that out loud in a  tweet.  Russia won the Italian election, she explained.  Well, maybe  Samantha Power and her friends at \"MSNBC\" and the rest have no choice but  to keep pretending.</p><p> If our ruling class admitted the sad truth about Russia, they'd have to  take responsibility for their own ineptitude and failures and they won't.   And so, the insanity continues.</p><p> Christy Setzer is a Democratic strategist, president of New Heights  Communications and a connoisseur of the Russia story and she joins us  tonight.</p><p> So, Christy, this Italian thing happened.  And I'm not saying it's the most  important thing to happen this year, but it's another domino that is  leading clearly toward the dissolution of the European Union, toward the  order in Europe and in this country, by the way.  Russia did that?</p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's possible that they played a  role.  It's possible.  What we have seen - and these two things can both be  true at the same time.  It can, one, be true that organically,  independently, we are seeing, across the globe, these movements that are  populist, that are anti-immigrant that have a lot of different things in  common.</p><p> And also, it's being true that Russia is sort of stirring the pot.  We have  recently found out that a Russian troll farm was spending a million dollars  a month in 2016 in the US elections to sort of, again, stir the pot, to  influence our elections by supporting Donald Trump and going -</p><p> CARLSON:  The democrats spend over a billion - look, I'm not saying that  Russia is not trying to destabilize the United States.  What I'm saying is  it's irrelevant.  And if you look at the actual poll numbers, they show  pretty consistently in a lot of different countries that people are  dissatisfied with the leadership of the people in charge.</p><p> And that's why Trump got elected.  That's why Brexit happened.  That's why  Scandinavia is about to turn.  That's why we almost had Marine Le Pen in  France.</p><p> And in each one of these cases, the elites rather than accept  responsibility, blame an unseen foreign hand.  You don't see a thread here?</p><p> SETZER:  I think, as I just said, that both things can be true.  It's true,  on one hand, that there was unrest among the country that was unhappy with  the leaders that they have been given for the last, I don't know, decade,  couple of decades.</p><p> At the same time, it's also true that Russia has been grooming Donald Trump  for years.  At least that's what the Steele dossier says.</p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  I don't think it's fair or honest to say that the  allegation is Russia is just helping populist or right-wing movements like  Trump or Berlusconi or Marine Le Pen.</p><p> The claim is also that the Russians were helping Bernie Sanders.  Right?   And that they were helping Jill Stein.</p><p> SETZER:  They were helping anti-Hillary Clinton.  That's what they were  doing.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are paying for the most left-wing cable station there is,  \"RT\".  So, it's a little more complicated.  </p><p> So, \"Rolling Stone\" -</p><p> SETZER:  It's a pro-Russia station.  It's not necessarily left wing.  The  two are not the same.</p><p> CARLSON:  Maybe the obvious is true, which is that people in charge as  represented by the morning show on \"MSNBC\", you know what I mean, like the  people who have been making policy for the past 30 years haven't taken into  account the views of voters and voters are mad about that.</p><p> And so, rather than like learn something from what's happening, they're  blaming forces that aren't there, the Russians.</p><p> SETZER:  The Russian forces are, in fact, there.  And I think all you have  to do is listen to not just Samantha Power, you can listen to any one of -  you can listen to our own secretary of state.  You can listen to Rex  Tillerson.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But I don't care because none of those people is wise beginning  with Samantha Power, whose foreign policy has left the region in tatters.</p><p> SETZER:  She is also not in power.</p><p> CARLSON:  She's not.  But she's implicated in the disaster that is the  world 2018 that democratic voters in democratic nations across the West are  reacting against.  </p><p> So, do you think there's any coincidence that the Russia hoax is being used  to discredit anybody not on the right, but anybody who challenges power.   You ever notice that?</p><p> SETZER:  Obviously, I deeply disagree with calling it a Russia hoax.   Again, if we can go back to what the origins of Russia \"hoax\" were, it went  back to well-before the 2016 election.</p><p> But that's when we first learned about it, was, as you may remember, from  one of the debates with Hillary Clinton when she talked about 17  intelligence agencies in the US have all concluded that Russia has been  trying to meddle.  And I hate that word because it's so weak.  But have  been trying to influence US elections.  </p><p> We didn't listen to that story because -</p><p> CARLSON:  No evidence has emerged from that date till now that it's real.   I want you to think about something that was written in \"Rolling Stone\"  today by a very left-wing writer.  This is someone who hates Trump, who is  a full-on lefty and he said this.</p><p> \"By an amazing coincidence, virtually all the anti-system movements and  candidates that so terrified the political establishment just two years ago  have since been identified as covert or overt Russian destabilization  initiatives run by Putin.\"</p><p> It's not clear to you that this is a reaction against voters who are mad  because nothing is working for them.  And rather than listen to them, the  elites are like, oh, it's not our fault, it's Putin's fault.  You don't see  that at all.</p><p> SETZER:  I think - one more time -</p><p> CARLSON:  Or you just think that's part of it or no?  I keep asking the  question because I'm amazed that someone as smart as you doesn't see that  what ties claims that implicate Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is maybe  defensiveness on the part of the people in power.  You don't see that?</p><p> SETZER:  I believe that both things are true.  I believe that there is  populist unrest in our country in 2016.  I also believe that the Russians  both saw that, leveraged it, took advantage of it and kind of fanned the  flames of it, so that they could install somebody that they saw as willing  to - </p><p> CARLSON:  But there's no evidence they did that.</p><p> SETZER:  There's plenty of evidence that they did that.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's insane.</p><p> CARLSON:  Go back to the Trump Tower meeting.  They were offered -</p><p> CARLSON:  I can't even - wanted to keep this at a higher level because when  we get right down to the details, it gets so frustrating that I can't  continue.  Christy, thank you so much.</p><p> SETZER:  Tucker, thank you.</p><p> Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us.  Brit, you've  been in the media for a long time and television for many decades.</p><p> When you saw Sam Nunberg on yesterday, did you think to yourself, I would  have put him on if I were a bureau chief or I wouldn't have put him on if I  were bureau chief?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I very much hoped,  Tucker, that I would not have.  And it was worth noting that, before the  day was over, \"CNN's\" Erin Burnett had looked at him and said, I smell  liquor on your breath.  Could she have been the first and only \"CNN\" anchor  to notice that the guy was probably drunk?</p><p> Not only that.  He's plainly a very troubled soul.</p><p> As a journalist, when you come along, you don't have to make a psychiatric  diagnosis to recognize that somebody you're talking to may not be OK and  that whatever this person says may be indeed questionable.</p><p> And yet this guy held sway over the airwaves, as you pointed out earlier,  for hours on end, particularly on \"CNN\", but I guess others picked it up  and it got quite a ride yesterday.  </p><p> And, of course, the principal thing that made the headline, Tucker, was  when he said that he wasn't going to cooperate with Mueller.  Well, by this  morning, that was gone all and he said indeed he was going to cooperate  with Mueller.  As a matter of fact, he has very little choice.</p><p> But that was a non-story that lived all day long because it feeds this  whole narrative that there's something terribly wrong and that we have an  unqualified president under the influence of Russia and God knows what  else.</p><p> CARLSON:  And so, to make that point, you have someone who is under the  influence of alcohol to jump around the set and humiliate himself.  And not  only that, degrade the person who is interviewing him.  I wonder if there's  a cost long-term when you do stuff like that.</p><p> HUME:  Well, Tucker, what we're looking at here is that there's been a  belief for the longest time that the Trump election was illegitimate and  there's been a sense in the media that his election constitutes a kind of  national emergency because he's such an unqualified character, and so  likely to lead us off a cliff that it is the job of the media to join the  resistance and to find out what must be behind his election and what  scandals must lurk there in order really to take him down.</p><p> I mean, I think that's plainly what this is all about.  The media have  clearly joined the resistance.  And the coverage of this, I think, has  been, in the mainstream media at least, extremely one-sided, a lot of it  misguided.  There have been any number of stories that turned out badly all  along the way.</p><p> You'll remember \"CNN\", the group of their senior people sitting that they  had word that when Comey testified that he was going to testify that he had  never told Donald Trump that he was not under investigation and the next  day, of course, Comey came out and testified just the opposite.</p><p> You wonder how stories like that - and there have been several of them -  can possibly get past these seasoned journalists if they're not on a  crusade.  And I think they are.</p><p> CARLSON:  I remember when the Russians hacked the national power grid.  Do  you think it might help - oh, but they didn't, of course.  Do you think it  might help the rest of us who are getting agitated watching this just to  remind ourselves that what you're seeing is political advocacy?  There's no  expectation of objectivity or news.  What you're watching is one side  waging partisan battle against the other?</p><p> HUME:  Yes.  But it's strikingly effective.  Your previous guest, she  really didn't want to let go of the narrative that's out there that Russia  had an important effect on the election.</p><p> The evidence of that, as you pointed out, is extremely light at best.   Anything that Russia did to the tune of even a million dollars a month is  dwarfed by the rest of the spending and the other things that influenced  the outcome of elections.</p><p> But it's something that is held on to for dear life.  And I think it's the  story of coverage.  I think it's enraged the people who see things more  clearly than that, but on and on it goes.</p><p> You see it particularly in the character assassination of Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has had to put up with  unbelievable assaults on him.  And they continue to this day that he's the  guy who is at fault when you know that, on the Democratic side, feeding the  press, there's this unbelievable leak fest out of that committee and it  goes on and on.  Not a proud moment for the America news media in my  judgment.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's true.  Heilemann over at \"MSNBC\" called Nunes \"a Russian  agent\".  Two years ago, you'd be fired for saying something like that if  you couldn't support it, but he's, obviously, not going to.</p><p> HUME:  It borders on hysteria.  It's just so over the top.  I mean, you  don't have to be a Trump admirer to realize that the things that are being  said are just wildly out of proportion to anything real beneath them.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it's insane.  I know people who hate Trump who agree with  that completely, to be honest.  Brit, thank you very much.</p><p> HUME:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  We've got a Fox News alert.  Another fixture of the Trump  administration is stepping down.  National Economic Council Director Gary  Cohn says he's planning to leave the administration.  Why?</p><p> Well, Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us tonight with  details.  Hi, ed.</p><p> ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Tucker, great to see you.   Shortly after fresh denial from President Trump, there's simply no truth to  the idea that he can't bring stability to his White House, his lead  economic adviser is heading for the exits.</p><p> Well, the president is right that there's turnover in every White House,  Democrat or Republican, there's been a particularly large number of  departures lately from Hope Hicks to Rob Porter, multiple press  secretaries, communications directors, national security advisers and  chiefs of staff.</p><p> What's significant about Gary Cohn is he was a key architect of the tax  cut, plus the regulatory reform that has really propelled this economy with  the markets getting a lot more volatile in recent weeks.  There's no  denying this a big loss for the president.</p><p> And while he lost a high-profile battle to try and stop the president from  moving forward on those tariffs on aluminum and steel, White House  officials tonight are insisting Cohn is not running out just because of  that one dispute.</p><p> But, in fact, it was two months ago today, the president boasted he wanted  Cohn to stick around for a \"long time\".  </p><p> This is going to feed the mainstream media narrative you've been talking  about that there's chaos at the White House, but as the president noted  today, he likes conflict, he likes different points of view on trade, other  issues.  Diversity of thought, after all, is something that's supposed to  be celebrated.</p><p> And it was former chief of staff Reince Priebus who said over the weekend,  critics may pounce on a meandering process of the White House, but the  focus should be on the results the president is getting.  Not sure a lot of  people will agree with that or report that, but that is what his former  chief of staff said, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Ed Henry, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p> HENRY:  Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Good to see you.  Thanks.  </p><p> Top Republicans in the House are tonight demanding a new special prosecutor  to investigate abuses of civil liberties by the FBI.  What does that mean?   Will it happen?  We've got details coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Top House Republicans are tonight formally calling for a second  special counsel.  House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and  Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia say a new investigation, an  independent one, is needed to look into abuses of FISA surveillance during  and after the 2016 election.</p><p> Joe diGenova is a former US attorney for the District of Columbia and he  joins us tonight.  So, Joe, just bottom line it, you know a lot about  special counsels.  Are you for this or no?</p><p> JOE DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY:  Absolutely.  It has to happen because the  inspector general to whom this investigation has been given has no subpoena  power, he has no authority to interview anybody outside the Department of  Justice or FBI, he cannot even interview FBI and DOJ employees who have  left.</p><p> He cannot interview Clapper, Brennan, any of the people associated with it.   He can't interview all the people that have left, Yates, all those people.</p><p> So, the bottom line is, you have to have a grand jury.  It's fascinating.   We have a grand jury and a special counsel in Russiagate where there's been  no crime committed and here, with the FISA violations, where there have  been huge numbers of crimes committed by various people in various  departments, we have no grand jury.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, part of the reason you have a special counsel is to restore a  public faith in the system itself.  It seems to be making public the FISA  request for the warrants would go a long way to ending the debate over all  this.  Can that happen?  Will it happen?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  It should happen.  I cannot conceive of anything that is in  those affidavits that would compromise sources and methods.  It's ludicrous  that they haven't been released.  They should be released.  The American  people have a right to see them.</p><p> Because remember, Tucker, what this is all about, and FISA is just part of  it, there was a brazen plot by senior officials at DOJ and FBI in the Obama  administration and senior Obama administration intelligence officials to  exonerate Hillary Clinton falsely and then to frame Donald Trump if Hillary  lost the election.</p><p> We need a grand jury.  We need the FISA applications out.  We need it all  done, and we need it done now.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, here's a new angle in this and I want to get your response to  it.  So, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who still works at the bureau, I think, in  human resources, may have known about a breach of Hillary Clinton's private  e-mail server, but apparently didn't do anything about it.</p><p> Sources have told Fox News that, during the final months of the FBI's  investigation into Hillary Clinton's server, irregularities in the server's  metadata were found and that indicated a potential breach.  </p><p> Strzok, who was overseeing that investigation, took no action in response,  according to our sources.  Maybe he was too busy sending anti-Trump text  messages to his mistress or whatever.</p><p> Does that seem out of the ordinary to you?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  It's absolutely out of the ordinary.  And here's what happened  on top of that.  James Clapper, who was the director of national  intelligence under Obama, when he found out that Hillary Clinton's server  had been compromised, they're required by law to conduct a damage  assessment, to see whether or not sources and methods have been  compromised.</p><p> He refused.  Clapper refused to do a damage assessment, and that is why  Strzok decided not to investigate the compromise of Hillary's server.</p><p> CARLSON:  On what grounds did Clapper, who by the way is the same one who  under oath lied to Congress and the public about spying on Americans, on  what grounds did he refuse to do a damage assessment?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  Because he wanted to protect Hillary and he could do it and he  had the consent of the president not to do an assessment.</p><p> And by that, I mean, the consent of President Obama.</p><p> CARLSON:  Wow, that's pretty shocking.  Thank you, Joe.  I appreciate that.</p><p> DIGENOVA:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a group of physicians are calling on doctors to shame gun  owners during checkups.  Kind of an amazing story.  It may happen.  Stay  tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Most cable new shows are pretty varied.  They cover a lot of  topics.  But over on \"MSNBC\", Joy Reid's show is the exception.  Her show  has only one topic.  How everyone who disagrees with her is a racist.  </p><p> She's not a civil right advocate.  She's just a monomaniac.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOY REID, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"AM JOY\":  It's been no secret that Trump harbors  racist attitudes about brown and black people in the US and other parts of  the world.</p><p> We're just another Western nation falling to the ethno-nationalist forces  sweeping across Europe, feeding on the fear of non-white and non-Christian  immigrants.</p><p>Trump ushers in an emboldened KKK and an alt-right that will soon have a  place in the White House.</p><p> We grapple with what it means to have a president stained by racism.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's the whole show really every week.  So, there's no  need for you to watch, though you might be tempted.</p><p> But when you're Joy Reid, the answer to every question, no matter what it  is, bigotry.  The only variable is volume.</p><p> This past weekend, she melted down completely over a joke the president  told about Nancy Pelosi.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REID:  He reportedly also said that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to come up  with a line as good as \"lock her up\" and that her line, says Donald Trump,  that she announced last week is \"mow the grass.\" Mow the freaking grass.   That isn't going to stop MS-13.  Mow the freakin' grass.</p><p> That sounds like an aspersion or a slap at immigrants, at Mexican- Americans.  At least, that's how I'm reading it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  At least, that's how I'm reading it.  Of course, you're reading  it that way.  </p><p> Of course, back in reality, Trump was just ridiculing Pelosi over a  proposal that the boarder can be kept secure with proper lawn care.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We all have a responsibility to  protect our borders.  Should there be fencing?  Should there be technology?   Should they mow the grass, so that people can't hide in it, let's talk  about where a more serious structure might be necessary, where fencing will  do or mowing grass, so people can't be smuggled through the grass.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, is Pelosi the secret grand wizard.  We'll see if Joy Reid  denounces her.  Of course, she'll denounce us too.  Can't wait.</p><p> Are you ready to get a gun control lecture next time you go to the doctor?   Well, a recent editorial in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" urges  physicians to start publicly campaigning for gun control, while also  pestering their patients about how unsafe it is to own guns.</p><p> The editorial says \"don't let your concerns for perceived political  consequences get in the way for advocating for the well-being of your  patients and the public.\"</p><p> Dr.  Christine Laine is editor in chief of the \"Annals of Internal  Medicine\" and she co-authored that piece and she joins us tonight.  Doctor,  thanks for coming on.</p><p> DR.  CHRISTINE LAINE, PHYSICIAN:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I was reading about this and you all said that, over at the  annals, that the massacre in Las Vegas urged you to do this.  And it got me  thinking, would this have presented that?  Do you think if you had told  Stephen Paddock that guns are dangerous that he wouldn't have opened fire?</p><p> LAINE:  No.  And that's not exactly what our proposal is.  Our proposal is  to treat firearm injury like a public health problem that it has become.   And one opportunity to do that is for in the exam rooms for doctors to talk  to their patients who are at risk for injuring themselves or others with  guns about how to deal with it more safely.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you're not an expert on guns.  Would it make you  uncomfortable if I gave you medical advice?</p><p> LAINE:  Yes, that would make pretty uncomfortable.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, me too.  That's why I wouldn't do it.</p><p> LAINE:  I'm not an expert on guns, but I am a medical expert.  And part of  what physicians do is to assess risk and then help talk to their patients  about mitigating those risks.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, assess risks.  Like, when you guys send tens of millions of  doses of opioids into Appalachia and killed over 100,000 people.  That kind  of risk.  Where were you then?  Just wondering.  I can't help it since you  bragged about your risk assessment abilities.</p><p> LAINE:  Well, risk assessment - we do assess risk.  And it wasn't doctors  that sent tens of millions of doses of opioids to Appalachia or other  places.  </p><p> But we do assess risks.  We assess risks of high blood pressure, smoking,  risky sexual behavior that people puts at risk for infections.  When people  are elderly and at risk for falls, we ask about area rugs in the home.  We  talk to patients about seat belts.  There are lots of different risks that  we assess.</p><p> And this proposal is to remind physicians that when they have a patient who  is at risk for harming themselves or others to ask about whether they have  guns in the home and then talk to them about more safely storing those guns  or other interventions that can make them and their families safer.</p><p> CARLSON:  Would you acknowledge that there are people who ought to have a  gun in the home?  Like, if you live alone in a tough area where there's a  lot of crime, home invasions, would you ever say it's probably better to  have some way to defend yourself?</p><p> LAINE:  As a physician, I would not.  I don't think that that would be in  my purview to do.  It's certainly people's right in this country.  But if  that person was at risk of harming themselves or others, then I would be  counseling them that maybe it would not be safe to have a gun in their  home.</p><p> CARLSON:  But what if they were at risk of being harmed?  I mean, if the  point of this is harm reduction, as you claimed it was, then if someone was  a delivery man, for example, in a tough neighborhood delivering the  newspaper or delivering to bodegas at 3:00 a.m.  in the morning, wouldn't  you say it's probably better to be armed?</p><p> LAINE:  Actually, Tucker, there are data out there that show that if people  have access to a gun in their home, it doesn't actually keep them safer.   They're at much higher risk for a completed suicide or for a gun homicide.   People that have guns in their home.</p><p> So, it's easy to say that your assumption that having a gun in your hope  keeps your safer, there really are data that refute that assumption.</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think you know the data really because when you take  suicide out of that, it's a totally different picture.  And that's a  separate question I'd love to ask you about, whether you're against suicide  and trying to prevent suicide.  </p><p> But let me just ask you, are you saying that there is no circumstance where  someone is safer with a gun?  Is that your medical position?</p><p> LAINE:  No.  What I was saying is that, in a systematic review published in  the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" that looked at 16 studies that evaluated  the risk of a completed suicide or a gun homicide by whether or not the  person had access to guns in the home that the risk for both those things,  a completed suicide and a gun homicide, was higher in individuals - </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm familiar with those statistics and they're misleading, so I'm  a little surprised that you're citing them because I think serious people  know that.</p><p> But let me just ask you this.  if I said, I live at the end - I'm disabled  and I live at the end of a long road where the police can't get there  within ten minutes, there have been home invasions, I feel I need to  protect myself, I feel I need a gun, would you actually say no, you don't  need a gun?  What would be your advice?</p><p> LAINE:  I think that's the patient's choice.  But if that patient was  depressed and at risk for suicide or was having homicidal ideation or had  cognitive deficits, I would probably counsel them that it was more safe for  them not to have a gun than have a gun.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I think that's fair.  I mean, if you're worried the person  is going to kill himself, I think you're absolutely right.</p><p> So, you as an organization have taken a strong position against suicide, it  sounds like, is that right?</p><p> LAINE:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  I mean, not all physicians have.  </p><p> LAINE:  I don't think there are too many physicians that are for suicide.   I don't think there are too many physicians out there that advocate  suicide, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, like the entire state of Oregon where it's  legal and a lot of physicians participate in it and advocated for.  So,  yes, there are a lot of physicians in this country and in Europe who are  for suicide, as you know.</p><p> LAINE:  Tucker, you're talking about a completely different issue.  You're  talking about assisted suicide for people that have terminal illness and  are at the end of their life.  That really has nothing to do with the gun -</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, people shoot themselves with guns all the  time when they're in terminal pain or facing a terminal illness.  You're  just saying suicide is OK with a physician, but not alone.  Is that your  position?  I'm just trying to get to the nub of what you believe.</p><p> LAINE:  I think suicide with a gun is always pretty messy and it's not  something that physicians support.  </p><p> And one of the things that's lost in this - </p><p> CARLSON:  But suicide with a needle is OK.</p><p> LAINE:  What?</p><p> CARLSON:  Suicide with a needle can be OK, but suicide with a gun is always  wrong because it's messy?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> LAINE:  No, no.  It's wrong because even physician-assisted suicide is not  done with injection drugs.  You're talking about euthanasia, which is not  legal in this country.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  Well, you're dead at the end no matter what.  So, it doesn't  seem morally a different category to me.  But, obviously, you disagree.  </p><p> Dr.  Laine, thanks for coming on.</p><p> LAINE:  I thought we were going to talk about firearm injury?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, we were, but the majority, of course, of firearm deaths are  suicides, as you said.  And so, you're trying to protect people from that,  again, as you said.  So, I was trying to get to the nub of what you believe  because I don't think it's enough to come on and spew platitudes.  I think  it's important to explain precisely what you believe and what you mean.   So, I was trying to get you to do that.</p><p> LAINE:  OK.  So, if you give me an opportunity, I will.  So, what this - </p><p> CARLSON:  I think I have.  Doctor, I think I've given you, I don't know,  six or seven minutes.  And I think you've had a chance to explain it.  And  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p> Well, the NRA says it's fed up with dishonest journalists and is warning  them their time is running out.  What does that mean?  Dana Loesch joins us  next.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  In a new advertisement, the National Rifle Association warns left  wing journalists that \"time is running out for them.\" Here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON:  To every lying member of the media, to  every Hollywood phony, to the role model athletes who use their free speech  to alter and undermine what our flag represents, to the politicians who  would rather watch America burn than lose one ounce of their own personal  power, to the late night hosts who think their opinions are the only  opinions that matter, to the Joy-Ann Reids, the Morning Joes, the Mikas, to  those who stain honest reporting with partisanship, to those who bring bias  and propaganda to \"CNN\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\",  your time is running out.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  That's Dana Loesch.  Of course, in the ad, she speaks for the NRA  and she joins us tonight.  Dana, thanks for coming on.</p><p> LOESCH:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you are being criticized for inciting violence, some say, by  that phrase \"time is up.\" What does that mean?</p><p> LOESCH:  Well, time's up, of course, is a play on the Time's Up movement,  the Hollywood progressivism that, for so long, tolerated and celebrated  people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p> But, also, at the very end of that video there, Tucker, it was an  announcement for a program that I'm doing for \"NRA TV\" because I think a  free people have the right to hold accountable and to frisk and fact check  a free press.  And so, that's what it's all about.</p><p> Now, to be clear, I don't believe in universal statements.  And that's why,  those people in the media and those people in Hollywood who are pushing  propaganda or who are lying, yes, this is an indictment of you.</p><p> And the program for \"NRA TV\", which launches at the end of this month,  Tucker, is focusing on media malpractice and holding accountable that media  malpractice, which we have seen tons of, particularly in the past year.</p><p> CARLSON:  Where do you think that comes from?  Where do you think the gut  level animist you see in the media toward NRA, toward gun owners, where  does that come from?</p><p> LOESCH:  I think it's just - honestly, I think that there are a lot of  people who don't understand middle America.  I think that they don't  understand individuals who are Second Amendment practitioners.</p><p> I mean, you've talked about this on your show before, Tucker.  And I edited  under Andrew Breitbart big journalism for this very reason.  I was entirely  fed up with mainstream media, legacy media and the malpractice thereof.</p><p> And we saw how they disparaged and impugned the characters of those people,  the members of the Tea Party.  We saw them ignore, malign black  conservatives.  They ignore and malign conservative women.  They ignore and  malign gay conservatives.</p><p> And they bash good people in fly-over nation who are good enough to vote  for the Clintons for how many years?  But then, when they turn around and  they vote for Donald Trump, suddenly, Tucker, those people become bigots  and racists.</p><p> And we've watched media malign so many good Americans and seem to only  report one side of the story.</p><p> I mean, for instance, just look at everything that's happened with  Parkland.  Where is the media focusing on the Broward sheriff, for  instance, fighting the \"Miami Herald\" who has done epic work, they've done  amazing work in this story?</p><p> They've filed a lawsuit against the Broward Sheriff's Office trying to get  this video that the sheriff once promised that he was going to release.   Where is the focus on that?  </p><p> Or the political class that has let the mental crisis spiral out of  control?  Instead, honestly, Tucker, you know what they're writing about?   They're writing about my musical taste in \"Newsweek\" and focusing on my  appearance and me as a person and my husband and law-abiding gun owners  across the United States instead of doing their due diligence and acting  like the watchdog of the people.</p><p> So, who watches the watchers?  That's the question.</p><p> CARLSON:  If you're going to try and take people's guns away, don't you  think you have a moral obligation - and prevent them from protecting  themselves, don't you think you have an obligation to protect them better  than our elites are now doing?</p><p> LOESCH:  Yes.  That's what I don't understand.  Here we're looking at  multiple systemic failures coming from the government that failed to  protect us, all the while we have all of these individuals telling us,  well, you can trust the government to protect you.</p><p> Well, really?  They didn't with Sutherland Springs and they didn't with  Garland, Texas and they didn't with San Bernardino and they didn't with the  Navy Yard and they didn't in Charleston.  I could go on and on because  there were balls dropped in every single one of those instance, Tucker.  </p><p> And the political class has been largely silent.  They haven't been -</p><p> CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p> LOESCH:  They haven't been moved to make sure that the background check  system works, like Wayne LaPierre has called for 25 years to do.  And so, I  mean, this is where the focus - that's where - honestly, that's where the  focus should be in all of this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p> LOESCH:  But to the point of people trying to say that somehow fact  checking media is violent, the progressive left has been violent for a very  long time.  And I can't take seriously the criticisms of people, Tucker,  who ignored the fires in Ferguson and they ignored Antifa violence and they  ignored so many other things and now they want to act like it's threatening  to fact check media.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm just laughing because if you're asking sincere questions  about the people in charge, you're, obviously, working for Vladimir Putin.   So, good luck with your new Russian masters, Dana.</p><p> LOESCH:  I had Russian salad dressing earlier this week.  So, I guess, I'm  a spy or something.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  Thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.</p><p> Facebook is moving forward with a new messaging app designed to get your  children hooked on social media and rearrange their brains completely.  Can  anything stop big tech?  We'll ask someone who is trying.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  15 years ago, Facebook didn't exist.  Today, it dominates our  lives, shapes our conversation, even to some extent determines the way we  think.  Americans spend close to an hour every single day on Facebook.  But  the company wants more.</p><p> Facebook is rolling out a new app messenger for kids.  It's aimed at  children as young as six.  More than 100 child developments experts have  warned this is a bad idea.  Could be a disaster.  It serves to addict kids  to social media earlier than ever.  </p><p> It has massive implications for our society.  The company seems to be  ignoring that.  Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense and wrote the book  \"Talking Back to Facebook\" and he joins us tonight.</p><p> Jim, thanks for coming on.  Have I mischaracterized what this app is  intended to do and who it's aimed at?</p><p> JIM STEYER, COMMON SENSE MEDIA CEO:  Nope.  I think you nailed it, Tucker.   I mean, really, this is about social media for the kindergarten set.  It's  basically getting hooked kids at younger and younger ages - 6, 7, 8 - on  social media platforms like Facebook and it's crazy.  We don't need it.   And that's why all the experts came out and suggested that.</p><p> CARLSON:  But we know that heavy social media use among young people leads  to social maladjustment, depression, maybe even more grave things.  I mean,  the implication is certainly that it can really hurt people, gravely hurt  them.</p><p> So, why would Facebook want to do this?</p><p> STEYER:  Because it's in their own economic best interest.  I mean,  truthfully, you're trying to hook people at younger and younger ages to the  brand and to the concept, and so it's an economic incentive.  But,  obviously, it's missing out on all the negative unintended consequences  that you just referred to.</p><p> I mean, this is just a no-brainer for a parent.  Why would you want your  six-year-old using Facebook or Instagram?  So, this is just - should be a  non-starter for parents.</p><p> CARLSON:  I mean, I'm sure R.J.  Reynolds would like to come out with a new  cigarette that's kindergarten friendly, but we say, no, you can't.  I mean,  adults can decide to do that if they want, but our society does not allow  cigar makers to sell to children.  Why are we allowing Facebook to do this  when we know it harms them?</p><p> STEYER:  Well, I think it's a very apt comparison.  And it's like candy- coated cigarettes.  So, you want to hook kids at younger and younger ages.</p><p> So, we actually at Common Sense think this is not a good idea at all.  And  it also brings up the broader issue of how do you get your kids - you're a  parent too, Tucker.  How do you get your kids away from the screen,  enjoying the incredible outdoors and world around them?  You just don't  want sitting on social media platforms in kindergarten or actually at any  age.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I mean, we know that it affects kids' ability to read and  retain information and to think clearly.  So, is there any legislative  effort to pull back?  Are we just passive in the face of a threat to our  children?</p><p> STEYER:  Actually, Tucker, there's a lot of good stuff coming on this kind  of issue.  There's stuff here on the West Coast in terms of looking at the  addiction research that needs to be done around social media platforms.  </p><p> You're seeing much greater privacy concern now.  You're seeing a number of  different legislative efforts to try to either encourage or require  companies to respect the young kids in their audience.  And that's going to  grow.</p><p> We passed a bill called the Eraser Button here in California couple of  years ago, so that kids who made dumb decisions could erase them.  So, I  think you're going to see a growing public outcry.  And I think your  covering it helps in that as well.</p><p> CARLSON:  I hope so.  I mean, I can just see them marketing Google Maps to  babies to learn how to crawl.  We're losing a lot in this.  And, Jim, thank  you for sounding the call about it.  Appreciate it.</p><p> STEYER:  Well, thank you for having us on, Tucker, and thanks for your  supporting it as well.  We like it.</p><p> CARLSON:  Always.  Well, we've got a major announcement about something  starting tomorrow on the show.  We'll tell you what it is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country and, of  course, we're totally for that.  We're for empowering all Americans.</p><p> But, for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are  doing in America.  So, we took a close look at the numbers.  And we found  them so shocking that we're devoting the month of March to a special series  on men in America.  Every Wednesday starting tomorrow, you'll be stunned by  the scope of the crisis.  We were.  It's a largely ignored disaster.  And  it is a disaster.  It affects every person in America.</p><p> Hope you'll be also heartened by some of the potential solutions we're  looking at.  We kick off tomorrow night with renowned psychologist and  thinker Jordan Peterson every Wednesday at 8:00.  I hope you'll joining us  starting tomorrow.  </p><p> Tune in every night to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Thanks for a great hour.  Good night  from Washington.  Sean Hannity right now.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"HANNITY\":  Lying, pomposity, smugness,  groupthink, I got it.  I totally got it.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's the spirit, Sean.</p><p> Hannity:  All right, Tucker.  Thank you.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We'll have the latest on that in just a  minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first tonight, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg went on  television yesterday and the news world ground to a halt.  Nothing else  happened.  Americans stopped dying of drug ODs, the world's post-war order  stopped collapsing, robots stopped taking our jobs, the borders were secure  because for most of the day, all that mattered was Sam Nunberg.  Watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, \" ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\":  Good evening.  I'm Erin  Burnett, \"OutFront\".  Tonight, breaking news.  Defiant and speaking out,  Trump's former campaign aide Sam Nunberg refusing to comply with a grand  jury subpoena in the Russia investigation.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN HOST, \"CNN TONIGHT\":  This is exactly what the White House  did not want to hear.  So, you have to wonder, what does Sam Nunberg really  know.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, \"SITUATION ROOM\":  Perhaps unprecedented comments  from a former Trump campaign aide who says he's been subpoenaed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the history of American news media, we have never  witnessed anything like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Who writes news copy?  Russian bots, non-English speakers for  sure.  Sam Nunberg speaking out.</p><p>Who is Sam Nunberg exactly?  Well, I'll tell you.  Just yesterday, he was a  pretty obscure part-time political consultant from New York City, who has  apparently been struggling with a substance abuse problem.</p><p>He's actually a pretty nice guy, but you have probably never heard of him.   Almost nobody had heard of him.  And now, the media are telling you that  Nunberg could be the key to this whole scandal.  The John Dean of this fake  Watergate.  Except that, unlike John Dean, Nunberg was nowhere near the  decisions when they were made.</p><p>He worked at a low level of the Trump campaign before it was actually a  campaign.  He left almost a year-and-a-half before the election.  If there  was indeed a Russia conspiracy, Sam Nunberg would not know anything about  it.</p><p>More likely, what was going on yesterday, Nunberg brilliantly played the  press because it turns out, this Friday, he's talking to Robert Mueller's  investigators, which is yet another measure of how absurd this independent  counsel investigation is, if you're talking to Sam Nunberg.</p><p>Others, though, have been charged with perjury after doing interviews with  Mueller's investigators.  Nunberg will not be.  Why?  Because he just  admitted in public to being an alcoholic and then acted like a lunatic on  television for hours.</p><p>It is the perfect preemptive insanity defense.  Mueller can't indict him.   After yesterday, no jury would convict Sam Nunberg.  Was that Nunberg's  plan?  Well, we don't know really.  But if it was, none of the people  interviewing him yesterday would have figured it out because there's nobody  dumber than most cable news hosts at \"CNN\" and \"MSNBC\".</p><p>How dumb?  Well, dumb enough to see Russian saboteurs under every bed.   Russia, the place, the actual country, is grim and hopeless.  It's got a  lower than replacement birth date.  It's got waning power on the world  stage.  It has one military base outside its borders.  It's not a major  player anymore.  </p><p>But the imaginary Russia, the one you see on television every night, has  never been more powerful.  At the DNC and \"NBC News\", Vladimir Putin is  diabolical and omnipotent.  Putin put Trump in office.  He gave the Senate  nomination in Alabama to Roy Moore somehow.  He empowered the NRA.  He  likely handpicked seasoned masters of espionage like Sam Nunberg and Carter  Page to undermine our democracy.</p><p>It's delusional, but they fervently believe it.  Meanwhile back in the real  world, evidence mounts that the actual problem is not the Russians or  Vladimir Putin, it is the corrupt and decadent and resolutely stupid  leadership of our own elites.</p><p>That is why Trump got elected, in reaction to them.  That's why the  European Union is in the process of collapsing.</p><p>Just this weekend, in Italy, while we're all talking about Sam Nunberg, the  ruling party there was crushed, while antiestablishment candidates won big.   Voters, the polls showed, were deeply unhappy with economic policies that  have enriched a few, while stealing the future from young people.</p><p>They hated the immigration policies that have crushed their national  culture under waves of migrants.  Sound familiar?  Well, there, as here,  the elites have failed.</p><p>But they can't admit that?  They can't face their own failure.  So,  instead, they blame the unseen hand of Russia.</p><p>Former Obama official Samantha Power actually said that out loud in a  tweet.  Russia won the Italian election, she explained.  Well, maybe  Samantha Power and her friends at \"MSNBC\" and the rest have no choice but  to keep pretending.</p><p>If our ruling class admitted the sad truth about Russia, they'd have to  take responsibility for their own ineptitude and failures and they won't.   And so, the insanity continues.</p><p>Christy Setzer is a Democratic strategist, president of New Heights  Communications and a connoisseur of the Russia story and she joins us  tonight.</p><p>So, Christy, this Italian thing happened.  And I'm not saying it's the most  important thing to happen this year, but it's another domino that is  leading clearly toward the dissolution of the European Union, toward the  order in Europe and in this country, by the way.  Russia did that?</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's possible that they played a  role.  It's possible.  What we have seen - and these two things can both be  true at the same time.  It can, one, be true that organically,  independently, we are seeing, across the globe, these movements that are  populist, that are anti-immigrant that have a lot of different things in  common.</p><p>And also, it's being true that Russia is sort of stirring the pot.  We have  recently found out that a Russian troll farm was spending a million dollars  a month in 2016 in the US elections to sort of, again, stir the pot, to  influence our elections by supporting Donald Trump and going -</p><p>CARLSON:  The democrats spend over a billion - look, I'm not saying that  Russia is not trying to destabilize the United States.  What I'm saying is  it's irrelevant.  And if you look at the actual poll numbers, they show  pretty consistently in a lot of different countries that people are  dissatisfied with the leadership of the people in charge.</p><p>And that's why Trump got elected.  That's why Brexit happened.  That's why  Scandinavia is about to turn.  That's why we almost had Marine Le Pen in  France.</p><p>And in each one of these cases, the elites rather than accept  responsibility, blame an unseen foreign hand.  You don't see a thread here?</p><p>SETZER:  I think, as I just said, that both things can be true.  It's true,  on one hand, that there was unrest among the country that was unhappy with  the leaders that they have been given for the last, I don't know, decade,  couple of decades.</p><p>At the same time, it's also true that Russia has been grooming Donald Trump  for years.  At least that's what the Steele dossier says.</p><p>CARLSON:  Hold on.  I don't think it's fair or honest to say that the  allegation is Russia is just helping populist or right-wing movements like  Trump or Berlusconi or Marine Le Pen.</p><p>The claim is also that the Russians were helping Bernie Sanders.  Right?   And that they were helping Jill Stein.</p><p>SETZER:  They were helping anti-Hillary Clinton.  That's what they were  doing.</p><p>CARLSON:  They are paying for the most left-wing cable station there is,  \"RT\".  So, it's a little more complicated.  </p><p>So, \"Rolling Stone\" -</p><p>SETZER:  It's a pro-Russia station.  It's not necessarily left wing.  The  two are not the same.</p><p>CARLSON:  Maybe the obvious is true, which is that people in charge as  represented by the morning show on \"MSNBC\", you know what I mean, like the  people who have been making policy for the past 30 years haven't taken into  account the views of voters and voters are mad about that.</p><p>And so, rather than like learn something from what's happening, they're  blaming forces that aren't there, the Russians.</p><p>SETZER:  The Russian forces are, in fact, there.  And I think all you have  to do is listen to not just Samantha Power, you can listen to any one of -  you can listen to our own secretary of state.  You can listen to Rex  Tillerson.  </p><p>CARLSON:  But I don't care because none of those people is wise beginning  with Samantha Power, whose foreign policy has left the region in tatters.</p><p>SETZER:  She is also not in power.</p><p>CARLSON:  She's not.  But she's implicated in the disaster that is the  world 2018 that democratic voters in democratic nations across the West are  reacting against.  </p><p>So, do you think there's any coincidence that the Russia hoax is being used  to discredit anybody not on the right, but anybody who challenges power.   You ever notice that?</p><p>SETZER:  Obviously, I deeply disagree with calling it a Russia hoax.   Again, if we can go back to what the origins of Russia \"hoax\" were, it went  back to well-before the 2016 election.</p><p>But that's when we first learned about it, was, as you may remember, from  one of the debates with Hillary Clinton when she talked about 17  intelligence agencies in the US have all concluded that Russia has been  trying to meddle.  And I hate that word because it's so weak.  But have  been trying to influence US elections.  </p><p>We didn't listen to that story because -</p><p>CARLSON:  No evidence has emerged from that date till now that it's real.   I want you to think about something that was written in \"Rolling Stone\"  today by a very left-wing writer.  This is someone who hates Trump, who is  a full-on lefty and he said this.</p><p>\"By an amazing coincidence, virtually all the anti-system movements and  candidates that so terrified the political establishment just two years ago  have since been identified as covert or overt Russian destabilization  initiatives run by Putin.\"</p><p>It's not clear to you that this is a reaction against voters who are mad  because nothing is working for them.  And rather than listen to them, the  elites are like, oh, it's not our fault, it's Putin's fault.  You don't see  that at all.</p><p>SETZER:  I think - one more time -</p><p>CARLSON:  Or you just think that's part of it or no?  I keep asking the  question because I'm amazed that someone as smart as you doesn't see that  what ties claims that implicate Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is maybe  defensiveness on the part of the people in power.  You don't see that?</p><p>SETZER:  I believe that both things are true.  I believe that there is  populist unrest in our country in 2016.  I also believe that the Russians  both saw that, leveraged it, took advantage of it and kind of fanned the  flames of it, so that they could install somebody that they saw as willing  to - </p><p>CARLSON:  But there's no evidence they did that.</p><p>SETZER:  There's plenty of evidence that they did that.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's insane.</p><p>CARLSON:  Go back to the Trump Tower meeting.  They were offered -</p><p>CARLSON:  I can't even - wanted to keep this at a higher level because when  we get right down to the details, it gets so frustrating that I can't  continue.  Christy, thank you so much.</p><p>SETZER:  Tucker, thank you.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us.  Brit, you've  been in the media for a long time and television for many decades.</p><p>When you saw Sam Nunberg on yesterday, did you think to yourself, I would  have put him on if I were a bureau chief or I wouldn't have put him on if I  were bureau chief?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I very much hoped,  Tucker, that I would not have.  And it was worth noting that, before the  day was over, \"CNN's\" Erin Burnett had looked at him and said, I smell  liquor on your breath.  Could she have been the first and only \"CNN\" anchor  to notice that the guy was probably drunk?</p><p>Not only that.  He's plainly a very troubled soul.</p><p>As a journalist, when you come along, you don't have to make a psychiatric  diagnosis to recognize that somebody you're talking to may not be OK and  that whatever this person says may be indeed questionable.</p><p>And yet this guy held sway over the airwaves, as you pointed out earlier,  for hours on end, particularly on \"CNN\", but I guess others picked it up  and it got quite a ride yesterday.  </p><p>And, of course, the principal thing that made the headline, Tucker, was  when he said that he wasn't going to cooperate with Mueller.  Well, by this  morning, that was gone all and he said indeed he was going to cooperate  with Mueller.  As a matter of fact, he has very little choice.</p><p>But that was a non-story that lived all day long because it feeds this  whole narrative that there's something terribly wrong and that we have an  unqualified president under the influence of Russia and God knows what  else.</p><p>CARLSON:  And so, to make that point, you have someone who is under the  influence of alcohol to jump around the set and humiliate himself.  And not  only that, degrade the person who is interviewing him.  I wonder if there's  a cost long-term when you do stuff like that.</p><p>HUME:  Well, Tucker, what we're looking at here is that there's been a  belief for the longest time that the Trump election was illegitimate and  there's been a sense in the media that his election constitutes a kind of  national emergency because he's such an unqualified character, and so  likely to lead us off a cliff that it is the job of the media to join the  resistance and to find out what must be behind his election and what  scandals must lurk there in order really to take him down.</p><p>I mean, I think that's plainly what this is all about.  The media have  clearly joined the resistance.  And the coverage of this, I think, has  been, in the mainstream media at least, extremely one-sided, a lot of it  misguided.  There have been any number of stories that turned out badly all  along the way.</p><p>You'll remember \"CNN\", the group of their senior people sitting that they  had word that when Comey testified that he was going to testify that he had  never told Donald Trump that he was not under investigation and the next  day, of course, Comey came out and testified just the opposite.</p><p>You wonder how stories like that - and there have been several of them -  can possibly get past these seasoned journalists if they're not on a  crusade.  And I think they are.</p><p>CARLSON:  I remember when the Russians hacked the national power grid.  Do  you think it might help - oh, but they didn't, of course.  Do you think it  might help the rest of us who are getting agitated watching this just to  remind ourselves that what you're seeing is political advocacy?  There's no  expectation of objectivity or news.  What you're watching is one side  waging partisan battle against the other?</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  But it's strikingly effective.  Your previous guest, she  really didn't want to let go of the narrative that's out there that Russia  had an important effect on the election.</p><p>The evidence of that, as you pointed out, is extremely light at best.   Anything that Russia did to the tune of even a million dollars a month is  dwarfed by the rest of the spending and the other things that influenced  the outcome of elections.</p><p>But it's something that is held on to for dear life.  And I think it's the  story of coverage.  I think it's enraged the people who see things more  clearly than that, but on and on it goes.</p><p>You see it particularly in the character assassination of Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has had to put up with  unbelievable assaults on him.  And they continue to this day that he's the  guy who is at fault when you know that, on the Democratic side, feeding the  press, there's this unbelievable leak fest out of that committee and it  goes on and on.  Not a proud moment for the America news media in my  judgment.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's true.  Heilemann over at \"MSNBC\" called Nunes \"a Russian  agent\".  Two years ago, you'd be fired for saying something like that if  you couldn't support it, but he's, obviously, not going to.</p><p>HUME:  It borders on hysteria.  It's just so over the top.  I mean, you  don't have to be a Trump admirer to realize that the things that are being  said are just wildly out of proportion to anything real beneath them.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, it's insane.  I know people who hate Trump who agree with  that completely, to be honest.  Brit, thank you very much.</p><p>HUME:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  We've got a Fox News alert.  Another fixture of the Trump  administration is stepping down.  National Economic Council Director Gary  Cohn says he's planning to leave the administration.  Why?</p><p>Well, Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us tonight with  details.  Hi, ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Tucker, great to see you.   Shortly after fresh denial from President Trump, there's simply no truth to  the idea that he can't bring stability to his White House, his lead  economic adviser is heading for the exits.</p><p>Well, the president is right that there's turnover in every White House,  Democrat or Republican, there's been a particularly large number of  departures lately from Hope Hicks to Rob Porter, multiple press  secretaries, communications directors, national security advisers and  chiefs of staff.</p><p>What's significant about Gary Cohn is he was a key architect of the tax  cut, plus the regulatory reform that has really propelled this economy with  the markets getting a lot more volatile in recent weeks.  There's no  denying this a big loss for the president.</p><p>And while he lost a high-profile battle to try and stop the president from  moving forward on those tariffs on aluminum and steel, White House  officials tonight are insisting Cohn is not running out just because of  that one dispute.</p><p>But, in fact, it was two months ago today, the president boasted he wanted  Cohn to stick around for a \"long time\".  </p><p>This is going to feed the mainstream media narrative you've been talking  about that there's chaos at the White House, but as the president noted  today, he likes conflict, he likes different points of view on trade, other  issues.  Diversity of thought, after all, is something that's supposed to  be celebrated.</p><p>And it was former chief of staff Reince Priebus who said over the weekend,  critics may pounce on a meandering process of the White House, but the  focus should be on the results the president is getting.  Not sure a lot of  people will agree with that or report that, but that is what his former  chief of staff said, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Ed Henry, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p>HENRY:  Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON:  Good to see you.  Thanks.  </p><p>Top Republicans in the House are tonight demanding a new special prosecutor  to investigate abuses of civil liberties by the FBI.  What does that mean?   Will it happen?  We've got details coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Top House Republicans are tonight formally calling for a second  special counsel.  House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and  Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia say a new investigation, an  independent one, is needed to look into abuses of FISA surveillance during  and after the 2016 election.</p><p>Joe diGenova is a former US attorney for the District of Columbia and he  joins us tonight.  So, Joe, just bottom line it, you know a lot about  special counsels.  Are you for this or no?</p><p>JOE DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY:  Absolutely.  It has to happen because the  inspector general to whom this investigation has been given has no subpoena  power, he has no authority to interview anybody outside the Department of  Justice or FBI, he cannot even interview FBI and DOJ employees who have  left.</p><p>He cannot interview Clapper, Brennan, any of the people associated with it.   He can't interview all the people that have left, Yates, all those people.</p><p>So, the bottom line is, you have to have a grand jury.  It's fascinating.   We have a grand jury and a special counsel in Russiagate where there's been  no crime committed and here, with the FISA violations, where there have  been huge numbers of crimes committed by various people in various  departments, we have no grand jury.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, part of the reason you have a special counsel is to restore a  public faith in the system itself.  It seems to be making public the FISA  request for the warrants would go a long way to ending the debate over all  this.  Can that happen?  Will it happen?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  It should happen.  I cannot conceive of anything that is in  those affidavits that would compromise sources and methods.  It's ludicrous  that they haven't been released.  They should be released.  The American  people have a right to see them.</p><p>Because remember, Tucker, what this is all about, and FISA is just part of  it, there was a brazen plot by senior officials at DOJ and FBI in the Obama  administration and senior Obama administration intelligence officials to  exonerate Hillary Clinton falsely and then to frame Donald Trump if Hillary  lost the election.</p><p>We need a grand jury.  We need the FISA applications out.  We need it all  done, and we need it done now.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, here's a new angle in this and I want to get your response to  it.  So, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who still works at the bureau, I think, in  human resources, may have known about a breach of Hillary Clinton's private  e-mail server, but apparently didn't do anything about it.</p><p>Sources have told Fox News that, during the final months of the FBI's  investigation into Hillary Clinton's server, irregularities in the server's  metadata were found and that indicated a potential breach.  </p><p>Strzok, who was overseeing that investigation, took no action in response,  according to our sources.  Maybe he was too busy sending anti-Trump text  messages to his mistress or whatever.</p><p>Does that seem out of the ordinary to you?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  It's absolutely out of the ordinary.  And here's what happened  on top of that.  James Clapper, who was the director of national  intelligence under Obama, when he found out that Hillary Clinton's server  had been compromised, they're required by law to conduct a damage  assessment, to see whether or not sources and methods have been  compromised.</p><p>He refused.  Clapper refused to do a damage assessment, and that is why  Strzok decided not to investigate the compromise of Hillary's server.</p><p>CARLSON:  On what grounds did Clapper, who by the way is the same one who  under oath lied to Congress and the public about spying on Americans, on  what grounds did he refuse to do a damage assessment?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  Because he wanted to protect Hillary and he could do it and he  had the consent of the president not to do an assessment.</p><p>And by that, I mean, the consent of President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON:  Wow, that's pretty shocking.  Thank you, Joe.  I appreciate that.</p><p>DIGENOVA:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, a group of physicians are calling on doctors to shame gun  owners during checkups.  Kind of an amazing story.  It may happen.  Stay  tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Most cable new shows are pretty varied.  They cover a lot of  topics.  But over on \"MSNBC\", Joy Reid's show is the exception.  Her show  has only one topic.  How everyone who disagrees with her is a racist.  </p><p>She's not a civil right advocate.  She's just a monomaniac.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY REID, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"AM JOY\":  It's been no secret that Trump harbors  racist attitudes about brown and black people in the US and other parts of  the world.</p><p>We're just another Western nation falling to the ethno-nationalist forces  sweeping across Europe, feeding on the fear of non-white and non-Christian  immigrants.</p><p>Trump ushers in an emboldened KKK and an alt-right that will soon have a  place in the White House.</p><p>We grapple with what it means to have a president stained by racism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that's the whole show really every week.  So, there's no  need for you to watch, though you might be tempted.</p><p>But when you're Joy Reid, the answer to every question, no matter what it  is, bigotry.  The only variable is volume.</p><p>This past weekend, she melted down completely over a joke the president  told about Nancy Pelosi.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID:  He reportedly also said that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to come up  with a line as good as \"lock her up\" and that her line, says Donald Trump,  that she announced last week is \"mow the grass.\" Mow the freaking grass.   That isn't going to stop MS-13.  Mow the freakin' grass.</p><p>That sounds like an aspersion or a slap at immigrants, at Mexican- Americans.  At least, that's how I'm reading it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  At least, that's how I'm reading it.  Of course, you're reading  it that way.  </p><p>Of course, back in reality, Trump was just ridiculing Pelosi over a  proposal that the boarder can be kept secure with proper lawn care.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We all have a responsibility to  protect our borders.  Should there be fencing?  Should there be technology?   Should they mow the grass, so that people can't hide in it, let's talk  about where a more serious structure might be necessary, where fencing will  do or mowing grass, so people can't be smuggled through the grass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  So, is Pelosi the secret grand wizard.  We'll see if Joy Reid  denounces her.  Of course, she'll denounce us too.  Can't wait.</p><p>Are you ready to get a gun control lecture next time you go to the doctor?   Well, a recent editorial in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" urges  physicians to start publicly campaigning for gun control, while also  pestering their patients about how unsafe it is to own guns.</p><p>The editorial says \"don't let your concerns for perceived political  consequences get in the way for advocating for the well-being of your  patients and the public.\"</p><p>Dr.  Christine Laine is editor in chief of the \"Annals of Internal  Medicine\" and she co-authored that piece and she joins us tonight.  Doctor,  thanks for coming on.</p><p>DR.  CHRISTINE LAINE, PHYSICIAN:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, I was reading about this and you all said that, over at the  annals, that the massacre in Las Vegas urged you to do this.  And it got me  thinking, would this have presented that?  Do you think if you had told  Stephen Paddock that guns are dangerous that he wouldn't have opened fire?</p><p>LAINE:  No.  And that's not exactly what our proposal is.  Our proposal is  to treat firearm injury like a public health problem that it has become.   And one opportunity to do that is for in the exam rooms for doctors to talk  to their patients who are at risk for injuring themselves or others with  guns about how to deal with it more safely.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you're not an expert on guns.  Would it make you  uncomfortable if I gave you medical advice?</p><p>LAINE:  Yes, that would make pretty uncomfortable.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, me too.  That's why I wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAINE:  I'm not an expert on guns, but I am a medical expert.  And part of  what physicians do is to assess risk and then help talk to their patients  about mitigating those risks.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, assess risks.  Like, when you guys send tens of millions of  doses of opioids into Appalachia and killed over 100,000 people.  That kind  of risk.  Where were you then?  Just wondering.  I can't help it since you  bragged about your risk assessment abilities.</p><p>LAINE:  Well, risk assessment - we do assess risk.  And it wasn't doctors  that sent tens of millions of doses of opioids to Appalachia or other  places.  </p><p>But we do assess risks.  We assess risks of high blood pressure, smoking,  risky sexual behavior that people puts at risk for infections.  When people  are elderly and at risk for falls, we ask about area rugs in the home.  We  talk to patients about seat belts.  There are lots of different risks that  we assess.</p><p>And this proposal is to remind physicians that when they have a patient who  is at risk for harming themselves or others to ask about whether they have  guns in the home and then talk to them about more safely storing those guns  or other interventions that can make them and their families safer.</p><p>CARLSON:  Would you acknowledge that there are people who ought to have a  gun in the home?  Like, if you live alone in a tough area where there's a  lot of crime, home invasions, would you ever say it's probably better to  have some way to defend yourself?</p><p>LAINE:  As a physician, I would not.  I don't think that that would be in  my purview to do.  It's certainly people's right in this country.  But if  that person was at risk of harming themselves or others, then I would be  counseling them that maybe it would not be safe to have a gun in their  home.</p><p>CARLSON:  But what if they were at risk of being harmed?  I mean, if the  point of this is harm reduction, as you claimed it was, then if someone was  a delivery man, for example, in a tough neighborhood delivering the  newspaper or delivering to bodegas at 3:00 a.m.  in the morning, wouldn't  you say it's probably better to be armed?</p><p>LAINE:  Actually, Tucker, there are data out there that show that if people  have access to a gun in their home, it doesn't actually keep them safer.   They're at much higher risk for a completed suicide or for a gun homicide.   People that have guns in their home.</p><p>So, it's easy to say that your assumption that having a gun in your hope  keeps your safer, there really are data that refute that assumption.</p><p>CARLSON:  I don't think you know the data really because when you take  suicide out of that, it's a totally different picture.  And that's a  separate question I'd love to ask you about, whether you're against suicide  and trying to prevent suicide.  </p><p>But let me just ask you, are you saying that there is no circumstance where  someone is safer with a gun?  Is that your medical position?</p><p>LAINE:  No.  What I was saying is that, in a systematic review published in  the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" that looked at 16 studies that evaluated  the risk of a completed suicide or a gun homicide by whether or not the  person had access to guns in the home that the risk for both those things,  a completed suicide and a gun homicide, was higher in individuals - </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm familiar with those statistics and they're misleading, so I'm  a little surprised that you're citing them because I think serious people  know that.</p><p>But let me just ask you this.  if I said, I live at the end - I'm disabled  and I live at the end of a long road where the police can't get there  within ten minutes, there have been home invasions, I feel I need to  protect myself, I feel I need a gun, would you actually say no, you don't  need a gun?  What would be your advice?</p><p>LAINE:  I think that's the patient's choice.  But if that patient was  depressed and at risk for suicide or was having homicidal ideation or had  cognitive deficits, I would probably counsel them that it was more safe for  them not to have a gun than have a gun.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I think that's fair.  I mean, if you're worried the person  is going to kill himself, I think you're absolutely right.</p><p>So, you as an organization have taken a strong position against suicide, it  sounds like, is that right?</p><p>LAINE:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  No.  I mean, not all physicians have.  </p><p>LAINE:  I don't think there are too many physicians that are for suicide.   I don't think there are too many physicians out there that advocate  suicide, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, like the entire state of Oregon where it's  legal and a lot of physicians participate in it and advocated for.  So,  yes, there are a lot of physicians in this country and in Europe who are  for suicide, as you know.</p><p>LAINE:  Tucker, you're talking about a completely different issue.  You're  talking about assisted suicide for people that have terminal illness and  are at the end of their life.  That really has nothing to do with the gun -</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, people shoot themselves with guns all the  time when they're in terminal pain or facing a terminal illness.  You're  just saying suicide is OK with a physician, but not alone.  Is that your  position?  I'm just trying to get to the nub of what you believe.</p><p>LAINE:  I think suicide with a gun is always pretty messy and it's not  something that physicians support.  </p><p>And one of the things that's lost in this - </p><p>CARLSON:  But suicide with a needle is OK.</p><p>LAINE:  What?</p><p>CARLSON:  Suicide with a needle can be OK, but suicide with a gun is always  wrong because it's messy?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>LAINE:  No, no.  It's wrong because even physician-assisted suicide is not  done with injection drugs.  You're talking about euthanasia, which is not  legal in this country.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  Well, you're dead at the end no matter what.  So, it doesn't  seem morally a different category to me.  But, obviously, you disagree.  </p><p>Dr.  Laine, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LAINE:  I thought we were going to talk about firearm injury?</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, we were, but the majority, of course, of firearm deaths are  suicides, as you said.  And so, you're trying to protect people from that,  again, as you said.  So, I was trying to get to the nub of what you believe  because I don't think it's enough to come on and spew platitudes.  I think  it's important to explain precisely what you believe and what you mean.   So, I was trying to get you to do that.</p><p>LAINE:  OK.  So, if you give me an opportunity, I will.  So, what this - </p><p>CARLSON:  I think I have.  Doctor, I think I've given you, I don't know,  six or seven minutes.  And I think you've had a chance to explain it.  And  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>Well, the NRA says it's fed up with dishonest journalists and is warning  them their time is running out.  What does that mean?  Dana Loesch joins us  next.

Dana, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOESCH:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you are being criticized for inciting violence, some say, by  that phrase \"time is up.\" What does that mean?</p><p>LOESCH:  Well, time's up, of course, is a play on the Time's Up movement,  the Hollywood progressivism that, for so long, tolerated and celebrated  people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>But, also, at the very end of that video there, Tucker, it was an  announcement for a program that I'm doing for \"NRA TV\" because I think a  free people have the right to hold accountable and to frisk and fact check  a free press.  And so, that's what it's all about.</p><p>Now, to be clear, I don't believe in universal statements.  And that's why,  those people in the media and those people in Hollywood who are pushing  propaganda or who are lying, yes, this is an indictment of you.</p><p>And the program for \"NRA TV\", which launches at the end of this month,  Tucker, is focusing on media malpractice and holding accountable that media  malpractice, which we have seen tons of, particularly in the past year.</p><p>CARLSON:  Where do you think that comes from?  Where do you think the gut  level animist you see in the media toward NRA, toward gun owners, where  does that come from?</p><p>LOESCH:  I think it's just - honestly, I think that there are a lot of  people who don't understand middle America.  I think that they don't  understand individuals who are Second Amendment practitioners.</p><p>I mean, you've talked about this on your show before, Tucker.  And I edited  under Andrew Breitbart big journalism for this very reason.  I was entirely  fed up with mainstream media, legacy media and the malpractice thereof.</p><p>And we saw how they disparaged and impugned the characters of those people,  the members of the Tea Party.  We saw them ignore, malign black  conservatives.  They ignore and malign conservative women.  They ignore and  malign gay conservatives.</p><p>And they bash good people in fly-over nation who are good enough to vote  for the Clintons for how many years?  But then, when they turn around and  they vote for Donald Trump, suddenly, Tucker, those people become bigots  and racists.</p><p>And we've watched media malign so many good Americans and seem to only  report one side of the story.</p><p>I mean, for instance, just look at everything that's happened with  Parkland.  Where is the media focusing on the Broward sheriff, for  instance, fighting the \"Miami Herald\" who has done epic work, they've done  amazing work in this story?</p><p>They've filed a lawsuit against the Broward Sheriff's Office trying to get  this video that the sheriff once promised that he was going to release.   Where is the focus on that?  </p><p>Or the political class that has let the mental crisis spiral out of  control?  Instead, honestly, Tucker, you know what they're writing about?   They're writing about my musical taste in \"Newsweek\" and focusing on my  appearance and me as a person and my husband and law-abiding gun owners  across the United States instead of doing their due diligence and acting  like the watchdog of the people.</p><p>So, who watches the watchers?  That's the question.</p><p>CARLSON:  If you're going to try and take people's guns away, don't you  think you have a moral obligation - and prevent them from protecting  themselves, don't you think you have an obligation to protect them better  than our elites are now doing?</p><p>LOESCH:  Yes.  That's what I don't understand.  Here we're looking at  multiple systemic failures coming from the government that failed to  protect us, all the while we have all of these individuals telling us,  well, you can trust the government to protect you.</p><p>Well, really?  They didn't with Sutherland Springs and they didn't with  Garland, Texas and they didn't with San Bernardino and they didn't with the  Navy Yard and they didn't in Charleston.  I could go on and on because  there were balls dropped in every single one of those instance, Tucker.  </p><p>And the political class has been largely silent.  They haven't been -</p><p>CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p>LOESCH:  They haven't been moved to make sure that the background check  system works, like Wayne LaPierre has called for 25 years to do.  And so, I  mean, this is where the focus - that's where - honestly, that's where the  focus should be in all of this.</p><p>CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p>LOESCH:  But to the point of people trying to say that somehow fact  checking media is violent, the progressive left has been violent for a very  long time.  And I can't take seriously the criticisms of people, Tucker,  who ignored the fires in Ferguson and they ignored Antifa violence and they  ignored so many other things and now they want to act like it's threatening  to fact check media.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'm just laughing because if you're asking sincere questions  about the people in charge, you're, obviously, working for Vladimir Putin.   So, good luck with your new Russian masters, Dana.</p><p>LOESCH:  I had Russian salad dressing earlier this week.  So, I guess, I'm  a spy or something.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  Thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.</p><p>Facebook is moving forward with a new messaging app designed to get your  children hooked on social media and rearrange their brains completely.  Can  anything stop big tech?  We'll ask someone who is trying.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  15 years ago, Facebook didn't exist.  Today, it dominates our  lives, shapes our conversation, even to some extent determines the way we  think.  Americans spend close to an hour every single day on Facebook.  But  the company wants more.</p><p>Facebook is rolling out a new app messenger for kids.  It's aimed at  children as young as six.  More than 100 child developments experts have  warned this is a bad idea.  Could be a disaster.  It serves to addict kids  to social media earlier than ever.  </p><p>It has massive implications for our society.  The company seems to be  ignoring that.  Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense and wrote the book  \"Talking Back to Facebook\" and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Jim, thanks for coming on.  Have I mischaracterized what this app is  intended to do and who it's aimed at?</p><p>JIM STEYER, COMMON SENSE MEDIA CEO:  Nope.  I think you nailed it, Tucker.   I mean, really, this is about social media for the kindergarten set.  It's  basically getting hooked kids at younger and younger ages - 6, 7, 8 - on  social media platforms like Facebook and it's crazy.  We don't need it.   And that's why all the experts came out and suggested that.</p><p>CARLSON:  But we know that heavy social media use among young people leads  to social maladjustment, depression, maybe even more grave things.  I mean,  the implication is certainly that it can really hurt people, gravely hurt  them.</p><p>So, why would Facebook want to do this?</p><p>STEYER:  Because it's in their own economic best interest.  I mean,  truthfully, you're trying to hook people at younger and younger ages to the  brand and to the concept, and so it's an economic incentive.  But,  obviously, it's missing out on all the negative unintended consequences  that you just referred to.</p><p>I mean, this is just a no-brainer for a parent.  Why would you want your  six-year-old using Facebook or Instagram?  So, this is just - should be a  non-starter for parents.</p><p>CARLSON:  I mean, I'm sure R.J.  Reynolds would like to come out with a new  cigarette that's kindergarten friendly, but we say, no, you can't.  I mean,  adults can decide to do that if they want, but our society does not allow  cigar makers to sell to children.  Why are we allowing Facebook to do this  when we know it harms them?</p><p>STEYER:  Well, I think it's a very apt comparison.  And it's like candy- coated cigarettes.  So, you want to hook kids at younger and younger ages.</p><p>So, we actually at Common Sense think this is not a good idea at all.  And  it also brings up the broader issue of how do you get your kids - you're a  parent too, Tucker.  How do you get your kids away from the screen,  enjoying the incredible outdoors and world around them?  You just don't  want sitting on social media platforms in kindergarten or actually at any  age.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  I mean, we know that it affects kids' ability to read and  retain information and to think clearly.  So, is there any legislative  effort to pull back?  Are we just passive in the face of a threat to our  children?</p><p>STEYER:  Actually, Tucker, there's a lot of good stuff coming on this kind  of issue.  There's stuff here on the West Coast in terms of looking at the  addiction research that needs to be done around social media platforms.  </p><p>You're seeing much greater privacy concern now.  You're seeing a number of  different legislative efforts to try to either encourage or require  companies to respect the young kids in their audience.  And that's going to  grow.</p><p>We passed a bill called the Eraser Button here in California couple of  years ago, so that kids who made dumb decisions could erase them.  So, I  think you're going to see a growing public outcry.  And I think your  covering it helps in that as well.</p><p>CARLSON:  I hope so.  I mean, I can just see them marketing Google Maps to  babies to learn how to crawl.  We're losing a lot in this.  And, Jim, thank  you for sounding the call about it.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STEYER:  Well, thank you for having us on, Tucker, and thanks for your  supporting it as well.  We like it.</p><p>CARLSON:  Always.  Well, we've got a major announcement about something  starting tomorrow on the show.  We'll tell you what it is coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country and, of  course, we're totally for that.  We're for empowering all Americans.</p><p>But, for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are  doing in America.  So, we took a close look at the numbers.  And we found  them so shocking that we're devoting the month of March to a special series  on men in America.  Every Wednesday starting tomorrow, you'll be stunned by  the scope of the crisis.  We were.  It's a largely ignored disaster.  And  it is a disaster.  It affects every person in America.</p><p>Hope you'll be also heartened by some of the potential solutions we're  looking at.  We kick off tomorrow night with renowned psychologist and  thinker Jordan Peterson every Wednesday at 8:00.  I hope you'll joining us  starting tomorrow.  </p><p>Tune in every night to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Thanks for a great hour.  Good night  from Washington.  Sean Hannity right now.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"HANNITY\":  Lying, pomposity, smugness,  groupthink, I got it.  I totally got it.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's the spirit, Sean.</p><p>Hannity:  All right, Tucker.  Thank you.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We'll have the latest on that in just a minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first tonight, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg went on television yesterday and the news world ground to a halt. Nothing else happened. Americans stopped dying of drug ODs, the world's post-war order stopped collapsing, robots stopped taking our jobs, the borders were secure because for most of the day, all that mattered was Sam Nunberg. Watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, \" ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\": Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett, \"OutFront\". Tonight, breaking news. Defiant and speaking out, Trump's former campaign aide Sam Nunberg refusing to comply with a grand jury subpoena in the Russia investigation.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN HOST, \"CNN TONIGHT\": This is exactly what the White House did not want to hear. So, you have to wonder, what does Sam Nunberg really know.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, \"SITUATION ROOM\": Perhaps unprecedented comments from a former Trump campaign aide who says he's been subpoenaed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the history of American news media, we have never witnessed anything like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Who writes news copy? Russian bots, non-English speakers for sure. Sam Nunberg speaking out.</p><p>Who is Sam Nunberg exactly? Well, I'll tell you. Just yesterday, he was a pretty obscure part-time political consultant from New York City, who has apparently been struggling with a substance abuse problem.</p><p>He's actually a pretty nice guy, but you have probably never heard of him. Almost nobody had heard of him. And now, the media are telling you that Nunberg could be the key to this whole scandal. The John Dean of this fake Watergate. Except that, unlike John Dean, Nunberg was nowhere near the decisions when they were made.</p><p>He worked at a low level of the Trump campaign before it was actually a campaign. He left almost a year-and-a-half before the election. If there was indeed a Russia conspiracy, Sam Nunberg would not know anything about it.</p><p>More likely, what was going on yesterday, Nunberg brilliantly played the press because it turns out, this Friday, he's talking to Robert Mueller's investigators, which is yet another measure of how absurd this independent counsel investigation is, if you're talking to Sam Nunberg.</p><p>Others, though, have been charged with perjury after doing interviews with Mueller's investigators. Nunberg will not be. Why? Because he just admitted in public to being an alcoholic and then acted like a lunatic on television for hours.</p><p>It is the perfect preemptive insanity defense. Mueller can't indict him. After yesterday, no jury would convict Sam Nunberg. Was that Nunberg's plan? Well, we don't know really. But if it was, none of the people interviewing him yesterday would have figured it out because there's nobody dumber than most cable news hosts at \"CNN\" and \"MSNBC\".</p><p>How dumb? Well, dumb enough to see Russian saboteurs under every bed. Russia, the place, the actual country, is grim and hopeless. It's got a lower than replacement birth date. It's got waning power on the world stage. It has one military base outside its borders. It's not a major player anymore.</p><p>But the imaginary Russia, the one you see on television every night, has never been more powerful. At the DNC and \"NBC News\", Vladimir Putin is diabolical and omnipotent. Putin put Trump in office. He gave the Senate nomination in Alabama to Roy Moore somehow. He empowered the NRA. He likely handpicked seasoned masters of espionage like Sam Nunberg and Carter Page to undermine our democracy.</p><p>It's delusional, but they fervently believe it. Meanwhile back in the real world, evidence mounts that the actual problem is not the Russians or Vladimir Putin, it is the corrupt and decadent and resolutely stupid leadership of our own elites.</p><p>That is why Trump got elected, in reaction to them. That's why the European Union is in the process of collapsing.</p><p>Just this weekend, in Italy, while we're all talking about Sam Nunberg, the ruling party there was crushed, while antiestablishment candidates won big. Voters, the polls showed, were deeply unhappy with economic policies that have enriched a few, while stealing the future from young people.</p><p>They hated the immigration policies that have crushed their national culture under waves of migrants. Sound familiar? Well, there, as here, the elites have failed.</p><p>But they can't admit that? They can't face their own failure. So, instead, they blame the unseen hand of Russia.</p><p>Former Obama official Samantha Power actually said that out loud in a tweet. Russia won the Italian election, she explained. Well, maybe Samantha Power and her friends at \"MSNBC\" and the rest have no choice but to keep pretending.</p><p>If our ruling class admitted the sad truth about Russia, they'd have to take responsibility for their own ineptitude and failures and they won't. And so, the insanity continues.</p><p>Christy Setzer is a Democratic strategist, president of New Heights Communications and a connoisseur of the Russia story and she joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Christy, this Italian thing happened. And I'm not saying it's the most important thing to happen this year, but it's another domino that is leading clearly toward the dissolution of the European Union, toward the order in Europe and in this country, by the way. Russia did that?</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It's possible that they played a role. It's possible. What we have seen - and these two things can both be true at the same time. It can, one, be true that organically, independently, we are seeing, across the globe, these movements that are populist, that are anti-immigrant that have a lot of different things in common.</p><p>And also, it's being true that Russia is sort of stirring the pot. We have recently found out that a Russian troll farm was spending a million dollars a month in 2016 in the US elections to sort of, again, stir the pot, to influence our elections by supporting Donald Trump and going -</p><p>CARLSON: The democrats spend over a billion - look, I'm not saying that Russia is not trying to destabilize the United States. What I'm saying is it's irrelevant. And if you look at the actual poll numbers, they show pretty consistently in a lot of different countries that people are dissatisfied with the leadership of the people in charge.</p><p>And that's why Trump got elected. That's why Brexit happened. That's why Scandinavia is about to turn. That's why we almost had Marine Le Pen in France.</p><p>And in each one of these cases, the elites rather than accept responsibility, blame an unseen foreign hand. You don't see a thread here?</p><p>SETZER: I think, as I just said, that both things can be true. It's true, on one hand, that there was unrest among the country that was unhappy with the leaders that they have been given for the last, I don't know, decade, couple of decades.</p><p>At the same time, it's also true that Russia has been grooming Donald Trump for years. At least that's what the Steele dossier says.</p><p>CARLSON: Hold on. I don't think it's fair or honest to say that the allegation is Russia is just helping populist or right-wing movements like Trump or Berlusconi or Marine Le Pen.</p><p>The claim is also that the Russians were helping Bernie Sanders. Right? And that they were helping Jill Stein.</p><p>SETZER: They were helping anti-Hillary Clinton. That's what they were doing.</p><p>CARLSON: They are paying for the most left-wing cable station there is, \"RT\". So, it's a little more complicated.</p><p>So, \"Rolling Stone\" -</p><p>SETZER: It's a pro-Russia station. It's not necessarily left wing. The two are not the same.</p><p>CARLSON: Maybe the obvious is true, which is that people in charge as represented by the morning show on \"MSNBC\", you know what I mean, like the people who have been making policy for the past 30 years haven't taken into account the views of voters and voters are mad about that.</p><p>And so, rather than like learn something from what's happening, they're blaming forces that aren't there, the Russians.</p><p>SETZER: The Russian forces are, in fact, there. And I think all you have to do is listen to not just Samantha Power, you can listen to any one of - you can listen to our own secretary of state. You can listen to Rex Tillerson.</p><p>CARLSON: But I don't care because none of those people is wise beginning with Samantha Power, whose foreign policy has left the region in tatters.</p><p>SETZER: She is also not in power.</p><p>CARLSON: She's not. But she's implicated in the disaster that is the world 2018 that democratic voters in democratic nations across the West are reacting against.</p><p>So, do you think there's any coincidence that the Russia hoax is being used to discredit anybody not on the right, but anybody who challenges power. You ever notice that?</p><p>SETZER: Obviously, I deeply disagree with calling it a Russia hoax. Again, if we can go back to what the origins of Russia \"hoax\" were, it went back to well-before the 2016 election.</p><p>But that's when we first learned about it, was, as you may remember, from one of the debates with Hillary Clinton when she talked about 17 intelligence agencies in the US have all concluded that Russia has been trying to meddle. And I hate that word because it's so weak. But have been trying to influence US elections.</p><p>We didn't listen to that story because -</p><p>CARLSON: No evidence has emerged from that date till now that it's real. I want you to think about something that was written in \"Rolling Stone\" today by a very left-wing writer. This is someone who hates Trump, who is a full-on lefty and he said this.</p><p>\"By an amazing coincidence, virtually all the anti-system movements and candidates that so terrified the political establishment just two years ago have since been identified as covert or overt Russian destabilization initiatives run by Putin.\"</p><p>It's not clear to you that this is a reaction against voters who are mad because nothing is working for them. And rather than listen to them, the elites are like, oh, it's not our fault, it's Putin's fault. You don't see that at all.</p><p>SETZER: I think - one more time -</p><p>CARLSON: Or you just think that's part of it or no? I keep asking the question because I'm amazed that someone as smart as you doesn't see that what ties claims that implicate Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is maybe defensiveness on the part of the people in power. You don't see that?</p><p>SETZER: I believe that both things are true. I believe that there is populist unrest in our country in 2016. I also believe that the Russians both saw that, leveraged it, took advantage of it and kind of fanned the flames of it, so that they could install somebody that they saw as willing to -</p><p>CARLSON: But there's no evidence they did that.</p><p>SETZER: There's plenty of evidence that they did that.</p><p>CARLSON: It's insane.</p><p>CARLSON: Go back to the Trump Tower meeting. They were offered -</p><p>CARLSON: I can't even - wanted to keep this at a higher level because when we get right down to the details, it gets so frustrating that I can't continue. Christy, thank you so much.</p><p>SETZER: Tucker, thank you.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us. Brit, you've been in the media for a long time and television for many decades.</p><p>When you saw Sam Nunberg on yesterday, did you think to yourself, I would have put him on if I were a bureau chief or I wouldn't have put him on if I were bureau chief?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I very much hoped, Tucker, that I would not have. And it was worth noting that, before the day was over, \"CNN's\" Erin Burnett had looked at him and said, I smell liquor on your breath. Could she have been the first and only \"CNN\" anchor to notice that the guy was probably drunk?</p><p>Not only that. He's plainly a very troubled soul.</p><p>As a journalist, when you come along, you don't have to make a psychiatric diagnosis to recognize that somebody you're talking to may not be OK and that whatever this person says may be indeed questionable.</p><p>And yet this guy held sway over the airwaves, as you pointed out earlier, for hours on end, particularly on \"CNN\", but I guess others picked it up and it got quite a ride yesterday.</p><p>And, of course, the principal thing that made the headline, Tucker, was when he said that he wasn't going to cooperate with Mueller. Well, by this morning, that was gone all and he said indeed he was going to cooperate with Mueller. As a matter of fact, he has very little choice.</p><p>But that was a non-story that lived all day long because it feeds this whole narrative that there's something terribly wrong and that we have an unqualified president under the influence of Russia and God knows what else.</p><p>CARLSON: And so, to make that point, you have someone who is under the influence of alcohol to jump around the set and humiliate himself. And not only that, degrade the person who is interviewing him. I wonder if there's a cost long-term when you do stuff like that.</p><p>HUME: Well, Tucker, what we're looking at here is that there's been a belief for the longest time that the Trump election was illegitimate and there's been a sense in the media that his election constitutes a kind of national emergency because he's such an unqualified character, and so likely to lead us off a cliff that it is the job of the media to join the resistance and to find out what must be behind his election and what scandals must lurk there in order really to take him down.</p><p>I mean, I think that's plainly what this is all about. The media have clearly joined the resistance. And the coverage of this, I think, has been, in the mainstream media at least, extremely one-sided, a lot of it misguided. There have been any number of stories that turned out badly all along the way.</p><p>You'll remember \"CNN\", the group of their senior people sitting that they had word that when Comey testified that he was going to testify that he had never told Donald Trump that he was not under investigation and the next day, of course, Comey came out and testified just the opposite.</p><p>You wonder how stories like that - and there have been several of them - can possibly get past these seasoned journalists if they're not on a crusade. And I think they are.</p><p>CARLSON: I remember when the Russians hacked the national power grid. Do you think it might help - oh, but they didn't, of course. Do you think it might help the rest of us who are getting agitated watching this just to remind ourselves that what you're seeing is political advocacy? There's no expectation of objectivity or news. What you're watching is one side waging partisan battle against the other?</p><p>HUME: Yes. But it's strikingly effective. Your previous guest, she really didn't want to let go of the narrative that's out there that Russia had an important effect on the election.</p><p>The evidence of that, as you pointed out, is extremely light at best. Anything that Russia did to the tune of even a million dollars a month is dwarfed by the rest of the spending and the other things that influenced the outcome of elections.</p><p>But it's something that is held on to for dear life. And I think it's the story of coverage. I think it's enraged the people who see things more clearly than that, but on and on it goes.</p><p>You see it particularly in the character assassination of Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has had to put up with unbelievable assaults on him. And they continue to this day that he's the guy who is at fault when you know that, on the Democratic side, feeding the press, there's this unbelievable leak fest out of that committee and it goes on and on. Not a proud moment for the America news media in my judgment.</p><p>CARLSON: It's true. Heilemann over at \"MSNBC\" called Nunes \"a Russian agent\". Two years ago, you'd be fired for saying something like that if you couldn't support it, but he's, obviously, not going to.</p><p>HUME: It borders on hysteria. It's just so over the top. I mean, you don't have to be a Trump admirer to realize that the things that are being said are just wildly out of proportion to anything real beneath them.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's insane. I know people who hate Trump who agree with that completely, to be honest. Brit, thank you very much.</p><p>HUME: You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We've got a Fox News alert. Another fixture of the Trump administration is stepping down. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn says he's planning to leave the administration. Why?</p><p>Well, Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us tonight with details. Hi, ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, great to see you. Shortly after fresh denial from President Trump, there's simply no truth to the idea that he can't bring stability to his White House, his lead economic adviser is heading for the exits.</p><p>Well, the president is right that there's turnover in every White House, Democrat or Republican, there's been a particularly large number of departures lately from Hope Hicks to Rob Porter, multiple press secretaries, communications directors, national security advisers and chiefs of staff.</p><p>What's significant about Gary Cohn is he was a key architect of the tax cut, plus the regulatory reform that has really propelled this economy with the markets getting a lot more volatile in recent weeks. There's no denying this a big loss for the president.</p><p>And while he lost a high-profile battle to try and stop the president from moving forward on those tariffs on aluminum and steel, White House officials tonight are insisting Cohn is not running out just because of that one dispute.</p><p>But, in fact, it was two months ago today, the president boasted he wanted Cohn to stick around for a \"long time\".</p><p>This is going to feed the mainstream media narrative you've been talking about that there's chaos at the White House, but as the president noted today, he likes conflict, he likes different points of view on trade, other issues. Diversity of thought, after all, is something that's supposed to be celebrated.</p><p>And it was former chief of staff Reince Priebus who said over the weekend, critics may pounce on a meandering process of the White House, but the focus should be on the results the president is getting. Not sure a lot of people will agree with that or report that, but that is what his former chief of staff said, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Ed Henry, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>HENRY: Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>Top Republicans in the House are tonight demanding a new special prosecutor to investigate abuses of civil liberties by the FBI. What does that mean? Will it happen? We've got details coming up.</p><p>CARLSON: Top House Republicans are tonight formally calling for a second special counsel. House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia say a new investigation, an independent one, is needed to look into abuses of FISA surveillance during and after the 2016 election.</p><p>Joe diGenova is a former US attorney for the District of Columbia and he joins us tonight. So, Joe, just bottom line it, you know a lot about special counsels. Are you for this or no?</p><p>JOE DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY: Absolutely. It has to happen because the inspector general to whom this investigation has been given has no subpoena power, he has no authority to interview anybody outside the Department of Justice or FBI, he cannot even interview FBI and DOJ employees who have left.</p><p>He cannot interview Clapper, Brennan, any of the people associated with it. He can't interview all the people that have left, Yates, all those people.</p><p>So, the bottom line is, you have to have a grand jury. It's fascinating. We have a grand jury and a special counsel in Russiagate where there's been no crime committed and here, with the FISA violations, where there have been huge numbers of crimes committed by various people in various departments, we have no grand jury.</p><p>CARLSON: So, part of the reason you have a special counsel is to restore a public faith in the system itself. It seems to be making public the FISA request for the warrants would go a long way to ending the debate over all this. Can that happen? Will it happen?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It should happen. I cannot conceive of anything that is in those affidavits that would compromise sources and methods. It's ludicrous that they haven't been released. They should be released. The American people have a right to see them.</p><p>Because remember, Tucker, what this is all about, and FISA is just part of it, there was a brazen plot by senior officials at DOJ and FBI in the Obama administration and senior Obama administration intelligence officials to exonerate Hillary Clinton falsely and then to frame Donald Trump if Hillary lost the election.</p><p>We need a grand jury. We need the FISA applications out. We need it all done, and we need it done now.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's a new angle in this and I want to get your response to it. So, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who still works at the bureau, I think, in human resources, may have known about a breach of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, but apparently didn't do anything about it.</p><p>Sources have told Fox News that, during the final months of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's server, irregularities in the server's metadata were found and that indicated a potential breach.</p><p>Strzok, who was overseeing that investigation, took no action in response, according to our sources. Maybe he was too busy sending anti-Trump text messages to his mistress or whatever.</p><p>Does that seem out of the ordinary to you?</p><p>DIGENOVA: It's absolutely out of the ordinary. And here's what happened on top of that. James Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence under Obama, when he found out that Hillary Clinton's server had been compromised, they're required by law to conduct a damage assessment, to see whether or not sources and methods have been compromised.</p><p>He refused. Clapper refused to do a damage assessment, and that is why Strzok decided not to investigate the compromise of Hillary's server.</p><p>CARLSON: On what grounds did Clapper, who by the way is the same one who under oath lied to Congress and the public about spying on Americans, on what grounds did he refuse to do a damage assessment?</p><p>DIGENOVA: Because he wanted to protect Hillary and he could do it and he had the consent of the president not to do an assessment.</p><p>And by that, I mean, the consent of President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow, that's pretty shocking. Thank you, Joe. I appreciate that.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a group of physicians are calling on doctors to shame gun owners during checkups. Kind of an amazing story. It may happen. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: Most cable new shows are pretty varied. They cover a lot of topics. But over on \"MSNBC\", Joy Reid's show is the exception. Her show has only one topic. How everyone who disagrees with her is a racist.</p><p>She's not a civil right advocate. She's just a monomaniac. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY REID, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"AM JOY\": It's been no secret that Trump harbors racist attitudes about brown and black people in the US and other parts of the world.</p><p>We're just another Western nation falling to the ethno-nationalist forces sweeping across Europe, feeding on the fear of non-white and non-Christian immigrants.</p><p>Trump ushers in an emboldened KKK and an alt-right that will soon have a place in the White House.</p><p>We grapple with what it means to have a president stained by racism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's the whole show really every week. So, there's no need for you to watch, though you might be tempted.</p><p>But when you're Joy Reid, the answer to every question, no matter what it is, bigotry. The only variable is volume.</p><p>This past weekend, she melted down completely over a joke the president told about Nancy Pelosi. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID: He reportedly also said that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to come up with a line as good as \"lock her up\" and that her line, says Donald Trump, that she announced last week is \"mow the grass.\" Mow the freaking grass. That isn't going to stop MS-13. Mow the freakin' grass.</p><p>That sounds like an aspersion or a slap at immigrants, at Mexican- Americans. At least, that's how I'm reading it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: At least, that's how I'm reading it. Of course, you're reading it that way.</p><p>Of course, back in reality, Trump was just ridiculing Pelosi over a proposal that the boarder can be kept secure with proper lawn care.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We all have a responsibility to protect our borders. Should there be fencing? Should there be technology? Should they mow the grass, so that people can't hide in it, let's talk about where a more serious structure might be necessary, where fencing will do or mowing grass, so people can't be smuggled through the grass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, is Pelosi the secret grand wizard. We'll see if Joy Reid denounces her. Of course, she'll denounce us too. Can't wait.</p><p>Are you ready to get a gun control lecture next time you go to the doctor? Well, a recent editorial in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" urges physicians to start publicly campaigning for gun control, while also pestering their patients about how unsafe it is to own guns.</p><p>The editorial says \"don't let your concerns for perceived political consequences get in the way for advocating for the well-being of your patients and the public.\"</p><p>Dr. Christine Laine is editor in chief of the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" and she co-authored that piece and she joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DR. CHRISTINE LAINE, PHYSICIAN: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I was reading about this and you all said that, over at the annals, that the massacre in Las Vegas urged you to do this. And it got me thinking, would this have presented that? Do you think if you had told Stephen Paddock that guns are dangerous that he wouldn't have opened fire?</p><p>LAINE: No. And that's not exactly what our proposal is. Our proposal is to treat firearm injury like a public health problem that it has become. And one opportunity to do that is for in the exam rooms for doctors to talk to their patients who are at risk for injuring themselves or others with guns about how to deal with it more safely.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you're not an expert on guns. Would it make you uncomfortable if I gave you medical advice?</p><p>LAINE: Yes, that would make pretty uncomfortable.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, me too. That's why I wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAINE: I'm not an expert on guns, but I am a medical expert. And part of what physicians do is to assess risk and then help talk to their patients about mitigating those risks.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, assess risks. Like, when you guys send tens of millions of doses of opioids into Appalachia and killed over 100,000 people. That kind of risk. Where were you then? Just wondering. I can't help it since you bragged about your risk assessment abilities.</p><p>LAINE: Well, risk assessment - we do assess risk. And it wasn't doctors that sent tens of millions of doses of opioids to Appalachia or other places.</p><p>But we do assess risks. We assess risks of high blood pressure, smoking, risky sexual behavior that people puts at risk for infections. When people are elderly and at risk for falls, we ask about area rugs in the home. We talk to patients about seat belts. There are lots of different risks that we assess.</p><p>And this proposal is to remind physicians that when they have a patient who is at risk for harming themselves or others to ask about whether they have guns in the home and then talk to them about more safely storing those guns or other interventions that can make them and their families safer.</p><p>CARLSON: Would you acknowledge that there are people who ought to have a gun in the home? Like, if you live alone in a tough area where there's a lot of crime, home invasions, would you ever say it's probably better to have some way to defend yourself?</p><p>LAINE: As a physician, I would not. I don't think that that would be in my purview to do. It's certainly people's right in this country. But if that person was at risk of harming themselves or others, then I would be counseling them that maybe it would not be safe to have a gun in their home.</p><p>CARLSON: But what if they were at risk of being harmed? I mean, if the point of this is harm reduction, as you claimed it was, then if someone was a delivery man, for example, in a tough neighborhood delivering the newspaper or delivering to bodegas at 3:00 a.m. in the morning, wouldn't you say it's probably better to be armed?</p><p>LAINE: Actually, Tucker, there are data out there that show that if people have access to a gun in their home, it doesn't actually keep them safer. They're at much higher risk for a completed suicide or for a gun homicide. People that have guns in their home.</p><p>So, it's easy to say that your assumption that having a gun in your hope keeps your safer, there really are data that refute that assumption.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think you know the data really because when you take suicide out of that, it's a totally different picture. And that's a separate question I'd love to ask you about, whether you're against suicide and trying to prevent suicide.</p><p>But let me just ask you, are you saying that there is no circumstance where someone is safer with a gun? Is that your medical position?</p><p>LAINE: No. What I was saying is that, in a systematic review published in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" that looked at 16 studies that evaluated the risk of a completed suicide or a gun homicide by whether or not the person had access to guns in the home that the risk for both those things, a completed suicide and a gun homicide, was higher in individuals -</p><p>CARLSON: I'm familiar with those statistics and they're misleading, so I'm a little surprised that you're citing them because I think serious people know that.</p><p>But let me just ask you this. if I said, I live at the end - I'm disabled and I live at the end of a long road where the police can't get there within ten minutes, there have been home invasions, I feel I need to protect myself, I feel I need a gun, would you actually say no, you don't need a gun? What would be your advice?</p><p>LAINE: I think that's the patient's choice. But if that patient was depressed and at risk for suicide or was having homicidal ideation or had cognitive deficits, I would probably counsel them that it was more safe for them not to have a gun than have a gun.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think that's fair. I mean, if you're worried the person is going to kill himself, I think you're absolutely right.</p><p>So, you as an organization have taken a strong position against suicide, it sounds like, is that right?</p><p>LAINE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: No. I mean, not all physicians have.</p><p>LAINE: I don't think there are too many physicians that are for suicide. I don't think there are too many physicians out there that advocate suicide, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I don't know, like the entire state of Oregon where it's legal and a lot of physicians participate in it and advocated for. So, yes, there are a lot of physicians in this country and in Europe who are for suicide, as you know.</p><p>LAINE: Tucker, you're talking about a completely different issue. You're talking about assisted suicide for people that have terminal illness and are at the end of their life. That really has nothing to do with the gun -</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I don't know, people shoot themselves with guns all the time when they're in terminal pain or facing a terminal illness. You're just saying suicide is OK with a physician, but not alone. Is that your position? I'm just trying to get to the nub of what you believe.</p><p>LAINE: I think suicide with a gun is always pretty messy and it's not something that physicians support.</p><p>And one of the things that's lost in this -</p><p>CARLSON: But suicide with a needle is OK.</p><p>LAINE: What?</p><p>CARLSON: Suicide with a needle can be OK, but suicide with a gun is always wrong because it's messy? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>LAINE: No, no. It's wrong because even physician-assisted suicide is not done with injection drugs. You're talking about euthanasia, which is not legal in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well, you're dead at the end no matter what. So, it doesn't seem morally a different category to me. But, obviously, you disagree.</p><p>Dr. Laine, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LAINE: I thought we were going to talk about firearm injury?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, we were, but the majority, of course, of firearm deaths are suicides, as you said. And so, you're trying to protect people from that, again, as you said. So, I was trying to get to the nub of what you believe because I don't think it's enough to come on and spew platitudes. I think it's important to explain precisely what you believe and what you mean. So, I was trying to get you to do that.</p><p>LAINE: OK. So, if you give me an opportunity, I will. So, what this -</p><p>CARLSON: I think I have. Doctor, I think I've given you, I don't know, six or seven minutes. And I think you've had a chance to explain it. And I appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>Well, the NRA says it's fed up with dishonest journalists and is warning them their time is running out. What does that mean? Dana Loesch joins us next. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: In a new advertisement, the National Rifle Association warns left wing journalists that \"time is running out for them.\" Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON: To every lying member of the media, to every Hollywood phony, to the role model athletes who use their free speech to alter and undermine what our flag represents, to the politicians who would rather watch America burn than lose one ounce of their own personal power, to the late night hosts who think their opinions are the only opinions that matter, to the Joy-Ann Reids, the Morning Joes, the Mikas, to those who stain honest reporting with partisanship, to those who bring bias and propaganda to \"CNN\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\", your time is running out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's Dana Loesch. Of course, in the ad, she speaks for the NRA and she joins us tonight. Dana, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOESCH: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you are being criticized for inciting violence, some say, by that phrase \"time is up.\" What does that mean?</p><p>LOESCH: Well, time's up, of course, is a play on the Time's Up movement, the Hollywood progressivism that, for so long, tolerated and celebrated people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>But, also, at the very end of that video there, Tucker, it was an announcement for a program that I'm doing for \"NRA TV\" because I think a free people have the right to hold accountable and to frisk and fact check a free press. And so, that's what it's all about.</p><p>Now, to be clear, I don't believe in universal statements. And that's why, those people in the media and those people in Hollywood who are pushing propaganda or who are lying, yes, this is an indictment of you.</p><p>And the program for \"NRA TV\", which launches at the end of this month, Tucker, is focusing on media malpractice and holding accountable that media malpractice, which we have seen tons of, particularly in the past year.</p><p>CARLSON: Where do you think that comes from? Where do you think the gut level animist you see in the media toward NRA, toward gun owners, where does that come from?</p><p>LOESCH: I think it's just - honestly, I think that there are a lot of people who don't understand middle America. I think that they don't understand individuals who are Second Amendment practitioners.</p><p>I mean, you've talked about this on your show before, Tucker. And I edited under Andrew Breitbart big journalism for this very reason. I was entirely fed up with mainstream media, legacy media and the malpractice thereof.</p><p>And we saw how they disparaged and impugned the characters of those people, the members of the Tea Party. We saw them ignore, malign black conservatives. They ignore and malign conservative women. They ignore and malign gay conservatives.</p><p>And they bash good people in fly-over nation who are good enough to vote for the Clintons for how many years? But then, when they turn around and they vote for Donald Trump, suddenly, Tucker, those people become bigots and racists.</p><p>And we've watched media malign so many good Americans and seem to only report one side of the story.</p><p>I mean, for instance, just look at everything that's happened with Parkland. Where is the media focusing on the Broward sheriff, for instance, fighting the \"Miami Herald\" who has done epic work, they've done amazing work in this story?</p><p>They've filed a lawsuit against the Broward Sheriff's Office trying to get this video that the sheriff once promised that he was going to release. Where is the focus on that?</p><p>Or the political class that has let the mental crisis spiral out of control? Instead, honestly, Tucker, you know what they're writing about? They're writing about my musical taste in \"Newsweek\" and focusing on my appearance and me as a person and my husband and law-abiding gun owners across the United States instead of doing their due diligence and acting like the watchdog of the people.</p><p>So, who watches the watchers? That's the question.</p><p>CARLSON: If you're going to try and take people's guns away, don't you think you have a moral obligation - and prevent them from protecting themselves, don't you think you have an obligation to protect them better than our elites are now doing?</p><p>LOESCH: Yes. That's what I don't understand. Here we're looking at multiple systemic failures coming from the government that failed to protect us, all the while we have all of these individuals telling us, well, you can trust the government to protect you.</p><p>Well, really? They didn't with Sutherland Springs and they didn't with Garland, Texas and they didn't with San Bernardino and they didn't with the Navy Yard and they didn't in Charleston. I could go on and on because there were balls dropped in every single one of those instance, Tucker.</p><p>And the political class has been largely silent. They haven't been -</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>LOESCH: They haven't been moved to make sure that the background check system works, like Wayne LaPierre has called for 25 years to do. And so, I mean, this is where the focus - that's where - honestly, that's where the focus should be in all of this.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>LOESCH: But to the point of people trying to say that somehow fact checking media is violent, the progressive left has been violent for a very long time. And I can't take seriously the criticisms of people, Tucker, who ignored the fires in Ferguson and they ignored Antifa violence and they ignored so many other things and now they want to act like it's threatening to fact check media.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just laughing because if you're asking sincere questions about the people in charge, you're, obviously, working for Vladimir Putin. So, good luck with your new Russian masters, Dana.</p><p>LOESCH: I had Russian salad dressing earlier this week. So, I guess, I'm a spy or something.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. Thank you for joining us. I appreciate it.</p><p>Facebook is moving forward with a new messaging app designed to get your children hooked on social media and rearrange their brains completely. Can anything stop big tech? We'll ask someone who is trying. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: 15 years ago, Facebook didn't exist. Today, it dominates our lives, shapes our conversation, even to some extent determines the way we think. Americans spend close to an hour every single day on Facebook. But the company wants more.</p><p>Facebook is rolling out a new app messenger for kids. It's aimed at children as young as six. More than 100 child developments experts have warned this is a bad idea. Could be a disaster. It serves to addict kids to social media earlier than ever.</p><p>It has massive implications for our society. The company seems to be ignoring that. Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense and wrote the book \"Talking Back to Facebook\" and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Jim, thanks for coming on. Have I mischaracterized what this app is intended to do and who it's aimed at?</p><p>JIM STEYER, COMMON SENSE MEDIA CEO: Nope. I think you nailed it, Tucker. I mean, really, this is about social media for the kindergarten set. It's basically getting hooked kids at younger and younger ages - 6, 7, 8 - on social media platforms like Facebook and it's crazy. We don't need it. And that's why all the experts came out and suggested that.</p><p>CARLSON: But we know that heavy social media use among young people leads to social maladjustment, depression, maybe even more grave things. I mean, the implication is certainly that it can really hurt people, gravely hurt them.</p><p>So, why would Facebook want to do this?</p><p>STEYER: Because it's in their own economic best interest. I mean, truthfully, you're trying to hook people at younger and younger ages to the brand and to the concept, and so it's an economic incentive. But, obviously, it's missing out on all the negative unintended consequences that you just referred to.</p><p>I mean, this is just a no-brainer for a parent. Why would you want your six-year-old using Facebook or Instagram? So, this is just - should be a non-starter for parents.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, I'm sure R.J. Reynolds would like to come out with a new cigarette that's kindergarten friendly, but we say, no, you can't. I mean, adults can decide to do that if they want, but our society does not allow cigar makers to sell to children. Why are we allowing Facebook to do this when we know it harms them?</p><p>STEYER: Well, I think it's a very apt comparison. And it's like candy- coated cigarettes. So, you want to hook kids at younger and younger ages.</p><p>So, we actually at Common Sense think this is not a good idea at all. And it also brings up the broader issue of how do you get your kids - you're a parent too, Tucker. How do you get your kids away from the screen, enjoying the incredible outdoors and world around them? You just don't want sitting on social media platforms in kindergarten or actually at any age.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I mean, we know that it affects kids' ability to read and retain information and to think clearly. So, is there any legislative effort to pull back? Are we just passive in the face of a threat to our children?</p><p>STEYER: Actually, Tucker, there's a lot of good stuff coming on this kind of issue. There's stuff here on the West Coast in terms of looking at the addiction research that needs to be done around social media platforms.</p><p>You're seeing much greater privacy concern now. You're seeing a number of different legislative efforts to try to either encourage or require companies to respect the young kids in their audience. And that's going to grow.</p><p>We passed a bill called the Eraser Button here in California couple of years ago, so that kids who made dumb decisions could erase them. So, I think you're going to see a growing public outcry. And I think your covering it helps in that as well.</p><p>CARLSON: I hope so. I mean, I can just see them marketing Google Maps to babies to learn how to crawl. We're losing a lot in this. And, Jim, thank you for sounding the call about it. Appreciate it.</p><p>STEYER: Well, thank you for having us on, Tucker, and thanks for your supporting it as well. We like it.</p><p>CARLSON: Always. Well, we've got a major announcement about something starting tomorrow on the show. We'll tell you what it is coming up next.</p><p>CARLSON: We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country and, of course, we're totally for that. We're for empowering all Americans.</p><p>But, for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are doing in America. So, we took a close look at the numbers. And we found them so shocking that we're devoting the month of March to a special series on men in America. Every Wednesday starting tomorrow, you'll be stunned by the scope of the crisis. We were. It's a largely ignored disaster. And it is a disaster. It affects every person in America.</p><p>Hope you'll be also heartened by some of the potential solutions we're looking at. We kick off tomorrow night with renowned psychologist and thinker Jordan Peterson every Wednesday at 8:00. I hope you'll joining us starting tomorrow.</p><p>Tune in every night to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Thanks for a great hour. Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity right now.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"HANNITY\": Lying, pomposity, smugness, groupthink, I got it. I totally got it.</p><p>CARLSON: That's the spirit, Sean.</p><p>Hannity: All right, Tucker. Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018030601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTG-RM31-JB20-G47R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>OR0001L1D</classCode><className>NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia Probe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sam Nunberg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Guns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Just yesterday, he was a  pretty obscure part-time political consultant from New York City, who has  apparently been struggling with a substance abuse problem.</p><p> He's actually a pretty nice guy, but you have probably never heard of him.   Almost nobody had heard of him.  And now, the media are telling you that  Nunberg could be the key to this whole scandal.  The John Dean of this fake  Watergate.  Except that, unlike John Dean, Nunberg was nowhere near the  decisions when they were made.</p><p> He worked at a low level of the Trump campaign before it was actually a  campaign.  He left almost a year-and-a-half before the election.  If there  was indeed a Russia conspiracy, Sam Nunberg would not know anything about  it.</p><p> More likely, what was going on yesterday, Nunberg brilliantly played the  press because it turns out, this Friday, he's talking to Robert Mueller's  investigators, which is yet another measure of how absurd this independent  counsel investigation is, if you're talking to Sam Nunberg.</p><p> Others, though, have been charged with perjury after doing interviews with  Mueller's investigators.  Nunberg will not be.  Why?  Because he just  admitted in public to being an alcoholic and then acted like a lunatic on  television for hours.</p><p> It is the perfect preemptive insanity defense.  Mueller can't indict him.   After yesterday, no jury would convict Sam Nunberg.  Was that Nunberg's  plan?  Well, we don't know really.  But if it was, none of the people  interviewing him yesterday would have figured it out because there's nobody  dumber than most cable news hosts at \"CNN\" and \"MSNBC\".</p><p> How dumb?  Well, dumb enough to see Russian saboteurs under every bed.   Russia, the place, the actual country, is grim and hopeless.  It's got a  lower than replacement birth date.  It's got waning power on the world  stage.  It has one military base outside its borders.  It's not a major  player anymore.  </p><p> But the imaginary Russia, the one you see on television every night, has  never been more powerful.  At the DNC and \"NBC News\", Vladimir Putin is  diabolical and omnipotent.  Putin put Trump in office.  He gave the Senate  nomination in Alabama to Roy Moore somehow.  He empowered the NRA.  He  likely handpicked seasoned masters of espionage like Sam Nunberg and Carter  Page to undermine our democracy.</p><p> It's delusional, but they fervently believe it.  Meanwhile back in the real  world, evidence mounts that the actual problem is not the Russians or  Vladimir Putin, it is the corrupt and decadent and resolutely stupid  leadership of our own elites.</p><p> That is why Trump got elected, in reaction to them.  That's why the  European Union is in the process of collapsing.</p><p> Just this weekend, in Italy, while we're all talking about Sam Nunberg, the  ruling party there was crushed, while antiestablishment candidates won big.   Voters, the polls showed, were deeply unhappy with economic policies that  have enriched a few, while stealing the future from young people.</p><p> They hated the immigration policies that have crushed their national  culture under waves of migrants.  Sound familiar?  Well, there, as here,  the elites have failed.</p><p> But they can't admit that?  They can't face their own failure.  So,  instead, they blame the unseen hand of Russia.</p><p> Former Obama official Samantha Power actually said that out loud in a  tweet.  Russia won the Italian election, she explained.  Well, maybe  Samantha Power and her friends at \"MSNBC\" and the rest have no choice but  to keep pretending.</p><p> If our ruling class admitted the sad truth about Russia, they'd have to  take responsibility for their own ineptitude and failures and they won't.   And so, the insanity continues.</p><p> Christy Setzer is a Democratic strategist, president of New Heights  Communications and a connoisseur of the Russia story and she joins us  tonight.</p><p> So, Christy, this Italian thing happened.  And I'm not saying it's the most  important thing to happen this year, but it's another domino that is  leading clearly toward the dissolution of the European Union, toward the  order in Europe and in this country, by the way.  Russia did that?</p><p> CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's possible that they played a  role.  It's possible.  What we have seen - and these two things can both be  true at the same time.  It can, one, be true that organically,  independently, we are seeing, across the globe, these movements that are  populist, that are anti-immigrant that have a lot of different things in  common.</p><p> And also, it's being true that Russia is sort of stirring the pot.  We have  recently found out that a Russian troll farm was spending a million dollars  a month in 2016 in the US elections to sort of, again, stir the pot, to  influence our elections by supporting Donald Trump and going -</p><p> CARLSON:  The democrats spend over a billion - look, I'm not saying that  Russia is not trying to destabilize the United States.  What I'm saying is  it's irrelevant.  And if you look at the actual poll numbers, they show  pretty consistently in a lot of different countries that people are  dissatisfied with the leadership of the people in charge.</p><p> And that's why Trump got elected.  That's why Brexit happened.  That's why  Scandinavia is about to turn.  That's why we almost had Marine Le Pen in  France.</p><p> And in each one of these cases, the elites rather than accept  responsibility, blame an unseen foreign hand.  You don't see a thread here?</p><p> SETZER:  I think, as I just said, that both things can be true.  It's true,  on one hand, that there was unrest among the country that was unhappy with  the leaders that they have been given for the last, I don't know, decade,  couple of decades.</p><p> At the same time, it's also true that Russia has been grooming Donald Trump  for years.  At least that's what the Steele dossier says.</p><p> CARLSON:  Hold on.  I don't think it's fair or honest to say that the  allegation is Russia is just helping populist or right-wing movements like  Trump or Berlusconi or Marine Le Pen.</p><p> The claim is also that the Russians were helping Bernie Sanders.  Right?   And that they were helping Jill Stein.</p><p> SETZER:  They were helping anti-Hillary Clinton.  That's what they were  doing.</p><p> CARLSON:  They are paying for the most left-wing cable station there is,  \"RT\".  So, it's a little more complicated.  </p><p> So, \"Rolling Stone\" -</p><p> SETZER:  It's a pro-Russia station.  It's not necessarily left wing.  The  two are not the same.</p><p> CARLSON:  Maybe the obvious is true, which is that people in charge as  represented by the morning show on \"MSNBC\", you know what I mean, like the  people who have been making policy for the past 30 years haven't taken into  account the views of voters and voters are mad about that.</p><p> And so, rather than like learn something from what's happening, they're  blaming forces that aren't there, the Russians.</p><p> SETZER:  The Russian forces are, in fact, there.  And I think all you have  to do is listen to not just Samantha Power, you can listen to any one of -  you can listen to our own secretary of state.  You can listen to Rex  Tillerson.  </p><p> CARLSON:  But I don't care because none of those people is wise beginning  with Samantha Power, whose foreign policy has left the region in tatters.</p><p> SETZER:  She is also not in power.</p><p> CARLSON:  She's not.  But she's implicated in the disaster that is the  world 2018 that democratic voters in democratic nations across the West are  reacting against.  </p><p> So, do you think there's any coincidence that the Russia hoax is being used  to discredit anybody not on the right, but anybody who challenges power.   You ever notice that?</p><p> SETZER:  Obviously, I deeply disagree with calling it a Russia hoax.   Again, if we can go back to what the origins of Russia \"hoax\" were, it went  back to well-before the 2016 election.</p><p> But that's when we first learned about it, was, as you may remember, from  one of the debates with Hillary Clinton when she talked about 17  intelligence agencies in the US have all concluded that Russia has been  trying to meddle.  And I hate that word because it's so weak.  But have  been trying to influence US elections.  </p><p> We didn't listen to that story because -</p><p> CARLSON:  No evidence has emerged from that date till now that it's real.   I want you to think about something that was written in \"Rolling Stone\"  today by a very left-wing writer.  This is someone who hates Trump, who is  a full-on lefty and he said this.</p><p> \"By an amazing coincidence, virtually all the anti-system movements and  candidates that so terrified the political establishment just two years ago  have since been identified as covert or overt Russian destabilization  initiatives run by Putin.\"</p><p> It's not clear to you that this is a reaction against voters who are mad  because nothing is working for them.  And rather than listen to them, the  elites are like, oh, it's not our fault, it's Putin's fault.  You don't see  that at all.</p><p> SETZER:  I think - one more time -</p><p> CARLSON:  Or you just think that's part of it or no?  I keep asking the  question because I'm amazed that someone as smart as you doesn't see that  what ties claims that implicate Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is maybe  defensiveness on the part of the people in power.  You don't see that?</p><p> SETZER:  I believe that both things are true.  I believe that there is  populist unrest in our country in 2016.  I also believe that the Russians  both saw that, leveraged it, took advantage of it and kind of fanned the  flames of it, so that they could install somebody that they saw as willing  to - </p><p> CARLSON:  But there's no evidence they did that.</p><p> SETZER:  There's plenty of evidence that they did that.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's insane.</p><p> CARLSON:  Go back to the Trump Tower meeting.  They were offered -</p><p> CARLSON:  I can't even - wanted to keep this at a higher level because when  we get right down to the details, it gets so frustrating that I can't  continue.  Christy, thank you so much.</p><p> SETZER:  Tucker, thank you.</p><p> Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us.  Brit, you've  been in the media for a long time and television for many decades.</p><p> When you saw Sam Nunberg on yesterday, did you think to yourself, I would  have put him on if I were a bureau chief or I wouldn't have put him on if I  were bureau chief?</p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I very much hoped,  Tucker, that I would not have.  And it was worth noting that, before the  day was over, \"CNN's\" Erin Burnett had looked at him and said, I smell  liquor on your breath.  Could she have been the first and only \"CNN\" anchor  to notice that the guy was probably drunk?</p><p> Not only that.  He's plainly a very troubled soul.</p><p> As a journalist, when you come along, you don't have to make a psychiatric  diagnosis to recognize that somebody you're talking to may not be OK and  that whatever this person says may be indeed questionable.</p><p> And yet this guy held sway over the airwaves, as you pointed out earlier,  for hours on end, particularly on \"CNN\", but I guess others picked it up  and it got quite a ride yesterday.  </p><p> And, of course, the principal thing that made the headline, Tucker, was  when he said that he wasn't going to cooperate with Mueller.  Well, by this  morning, that was gone all and he said indeed he was going to cooperate  with Mueller.  As a matter of fact, he has very little choice.</p><p> But that was a non-story that lived all day long because it feeds this  whole narrative that there's something terribly wrong and that we have an  unqualified president under the influence of Russia and God knows what  else.</p><p> CARLSON:  And so, to make that point, you have someone who is under the  influence of alcohol to jump around the set and humiliate himself.  And not  only that, degrade the person who is interviewing him.  I wonder if there's  a cost long-term when you do stuff like that.</p><p> HUME:  Well, Tucker, what we're looking at here is that there's been a  belief for the longest time that the Trump election was illegitimate and  there's been a sense in the media that his election constitutes a kind of  national emergency because he's such an unqualified character, and so  likely to lead us off a cliff that it is the job of the media to join the  resistance and to find out what must be behind his election and what  scandals must lurk there in order really to take him down.</p><p> I mean, I think that's plainly what this is all about.  The media have  clearly joined the resistance.  And the coverage of this, I think, has  been, in the mainstream media at least, extremely one-sided, a lot of it  misguided.  There have been any number of stories that turned out badly all  along the way.</p><p> You'll remember \"CNN\", the group of their senior people sitting that they  had word that when Comey testified that he was going to testify that he had  never told Donald Trump that he was not under investigation and the next  day, of course, Comey came out and testified just the opposite.</p><p> You wonder how stories like that - and there have been several of them -  can possibly get past these seasoned journalists if they're not on a  crusade.  And I think they are.</p><p> CARLSON:  I remember when the Russians hacked the national power grid.  Do  you think it might help - oh, but they didn't, of course.  Do you think it  might help the rest of us who are getting agitated watching this just to  remind ourselves that what you're seeing is political advocacy?  There's no  expectation of objectivity or news.  What you're watching is one side  waging partisan battle against the other?</p><p> HUME:  Yes.  But it's strikingly effective.  Your previous guest, she  really didn't want to let go of the narrative that's out there that Russia  had an important effect on the election.</p><p> The evidence of that, as you pointed out, is extremely light at best.   Anything that Russia did to the tune of even a million dollars a month is  dwarfed by the rest of the spending and the other things that influenced  the outcome of elections.</p><p> But it's something that is held on to for dear life.  And I think it's the  story of coverage.  I think it's enraged the people who see things more  clearly than that, but on and on it goes.</p><p> You see it particularly in the character assassination of Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has had to put up with  unbelievable assaults on him.  And they continue to this day that he's the  guy who is at fault when you know that, on the Democratic side, feeding the  press, there's this unbelievable leak fest out of that committee and it  goes on and on.  Not a proud moment for the America news media in my  judgment.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's true.  Heilemann over at \"MSNBC\" called Nunes \"a Russian  agent\".  Two years ago, you'd be fired for saying something like that if  you couldn't support it, but he's, obviously, not going to.</p><p> HUME:  It borders on hysteria.  It's just so over the top.  I mean, you  don't have to be a Trump admirer to realize that the things that are being  said are just wildly out of proportion to anything real beneath them.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, it's insane.  I know people who hate Trump who agree with  that completely, to be honest.  Brit, thank you very much.</p><p> HUME:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  We've got a Fox News alert.  Another fixture of the Trump  administration is stepping down.  National Economic Council Director Gary  Cohn says he's planning to leave the administration.  Why?</p><p> Well, Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us tonight with  details.  Hi, ed.</p><p> ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Tucker, great to see you.   Shortly after fresh denial from President Trump, there's simply no truth to  the idea that he can't bring stability to his White House, his lead  economic adviser is heading for the exits.</p><p> Well, the president is right that there's turnover in every White House,  Democrat or Republican, there's been a particularly large number of  departures lately from Hope Hicks to Rob Porter, multiple press  secretaries, communications directors, national security advisers and  chiefs of staff.</p><p> What's significant about Gary Cohn is he was a key architect of the tax  cut, plus the regulatory reform that has really propelled this economy with  the markets getting a lot more volatile in recent weeks.  There's no  denying this a big loss for the president.</p><p> And while he lost a high-profile battle to try and stop the president from  moving forward on those tariffs on aluminum and steel, White House  officials tonight are insisting Cohn is not running out just because of  that one dispute.</p><p> But, in fact, it was two months ago today, the president boasted he wanted  Cohn to stick around for a \"long time\".  </p><p> This is going to feed the mainstream media narrative you've been talking  about that there's chaos at the White House, but as the president noted  today, he likes conflict, he likes different points of view on trade, other  issues.  Diversity of thought, after all, is something that's supposed to  be celebrated.</p><p> And it was former chief of staff Reince Priebus who said over the weekend,  critics may pounce on a meandering process of the White House, but the  focus should be on the results the president is getting.  Not sure a lot of  people will agree with that or report that, but that is what his former  chief of staff said, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Ed Henry, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p> HENRY:  Good to see you.</p><p> CARLSON:  Good to see you.  Thanks.  </p><p> Top Republicans in the House are tonight demanding a new special prosecutor  to investigate abuses of civil liberties by the FBI.  What does that mean?   Will it happen?  We've got details coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Top House Republicans are tonight formally calling for a second  special counsel.  House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and  Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia say a new investigation, an  independent one, is needed to look into abuses of FISA surveillance during  and after the 2016 election.</p><p> Joe diGenova is a former US attorney for the District of Columbia and he  joins us tonight.  So, Joe, just bottom line it, you know a lot about  special counsels.  Are you for this or no?</p><p> JOE DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY:  Absolutely.  It has to happen because the  inspector general to whom this investigation has been given has no subpoena  power, he has no authority to interview anybody outside the Department of  Justice or FBI, he cannot even interview FBI and DOJ employees who have  left.</p><p> He cannot interview Clapper, Brennan, any of the people associated with it.   He can't interview all the people that have left, Yates, all those people.</p><p> So, the bottom line is, you have to have a grand jury.  It's fascinating.   We have a grand jury and a special counsel in Russiagate where there's been  no crime committed and here, with the FISA violations, where there have  been huge numbers of crimes committed by various people in various  departments, we have no grand jury.  </p><p> CARLSON:  So, part of the reason you have a special counsel is to restore a  public faith in the system itself.  It seems to be making public the FISA  request for the warrants would go a long way to ending the debate over all  this.  Can that happen?  Will it happen?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  It should happen.  I cannot conceive of anything that is in  those affidavits that would compromise sources and methods.  It's ludicrous  that they haven't been released.  They should be released.  The American  people have a right to see them.</p><p> Because remember, Tucker, what this is all about, and FISA is just part of  it, there was a brazen plot by senior officials at DOJ and FBI in the Obama  administration and senior Obama administration intelligence officials to  exonerate Hillary Clinton falsely and then to frame Donald Trump if Hillary  lost the election.</p><p> We need a grand jury.  We need the FISA applications out.  We need it all  done, and we need it done now.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, here's a new angle in this and I want to get your response to  it.  So, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who still works at the bureau, I think, in  human resources, may have known about a breach of Hillary Clinton's private  e-mail server, but apparently didn't do anything about it.</p><p> Sources have told Fox News that, during the final months of the FBI's  investigation into Hillary Clinton's server, irregularities in the server's  metadata were found and that indicated a potential breach.  </p><p> Strzok, who was overseeing that investigation, took no action in response,  according to our sources.  Maybe he was too busy sending anti-Trump text  messages to his mistress or whatever.</p><p> Does that seem out of the ordinary to you?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  It's absolutely out of the ordinary.  And here's what happened  on top of that.  James Clapper, who was the director of national  intelligence under Obama, when he found out that Hillary Clinton's server  had been compromised, they're required by law to conduct a damage  assessment, to see whether or not sources and methods have been  compromised.</p><p> He refused.  Clapper refused to do a damage assessment, and that is why  Strzok decided not to investigate the compromise of Hillary's server.</p><p> CARLSON:  On what grounds did Clapper, who by the way is the same one who  under oath lied to Congress and the public about spying on Americans, on  what grounds did he refuse to do a damage assessment?</p><p> DIGENOVA:  Because he wanted to protect Hillary and he could do it and he  had the consent of the president not to do an assessment.</p><p> And by that, I mean, the consent of President Obama.</p><p> CARLSON:  Wow, that's pretty shocking.  Thank you, Joe.  I appreciate that.</p><p> DIGENOVA:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, a group of physicians are calling on doctors to shame gun  owners during checkups.  Kind of an amazing story.  It may happen.  Stay  tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  Most cable new shows are pretty varied.  They cover a lot of  topics.  But over on \"MSNBC\", Joy Reid's show is the exception.  Her show  has only one topic.  How everyone who disagrees with her is a racist.  </p><p> She's not a civil right advocate.  She's just a monomaniac.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOY REID, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"AM JOY\":  It's been no secret that Trump harbors  racist attitudes about brown and black people in the US and other parts of  the world.</p><p> We're just another Western nation falling to the ethno-nationalist forces  sweeping across Europe, feeding on the fear of non-white and non-Christian  immigrants.</p><p>Trump ushers in an emboldened KKK and an alt-right that will soon have a  place in the White House.</p><p> We grapple with what it means to have a president stained by racism.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, that's the whole show really every week.  So, there's no  need for you to watch, though you might be tempted.</p><p> But when you're Joy Reid, the answer to every question, no matter what it  is, bigotry.  The only variable is volume.</p><p> This past weekend, she melted down completely over a joke the president  told about Nancy Pelosi.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REID:  He reportedly also said that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to come up  with a line as good as \"lock her up\" and that her line, says Donald Trump,  that she announced last week is \"mow the grass.\" Mow the freaking grass.   That isn't going to stop MS-13.  Mow the freakin' grass.</p><p> That sounds like an aspersion or a slap at immigrants, at Mexican- Americans.  At least, that's how I'm reading it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  At least, that's how I'm reading it.  Of course, you're reading  it that way.  </p><p> Of course, back in reality, Trump was just ridiculing Pelosi over a  proposal that the boarder can be kept secure with proper lawn care.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We all have a responsibility to  protect our borders.  Should there be fencing?  Should there be technology?   Should they mow the grass, so that people can't hide in it, let's talk  about where a more serious structure might be necessary, where fencing will  do or mowing grass, so people can't be smuggled through the grass.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  So, is Pelosi the secret grand wizard.  We'll see if Joy Reid  denounces her.  Of course, she'll denounce us too.  Can't wait.</p><p> Are you ready to get a gun control lecture next time you go to the doctor?   Well, a recent editorial in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" urges  physicians to start publicly campaigning for gun control, while also  pestering their patients about how unsafe it is to own guns.</p><p> The editorial says \"don't let your concerns for perceived political  consequences get in the way for advocating for the well-being of your  patients and the public.\"</p><p> Dr.  Christine Laine is editor in chief of the \"Annals of Internal  Medicine\" and she co-authored that piece and she joins us tonight.  Doctor,  thanks for coming on.</p><p> DR.  CHRISTINE LAINE, PHYSICIAN:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, I was reading about this and you all said that, over at the  annals, that the massacre in Las Vegas urged you to do this.  And it got me  thinking, would this have presented that?  Do you think if you had told  Stephen Paddock that guns are dangerous that he wouldn't have opened fire?</p><p> LAINE:  No.  And that's not exactly what our proposal is.  Our proposal is  to treat firearm injury like a public health problem that it has become.   And one opportunity to do that is for in the exam rooms for doctors to talk  to their patients who are at risk for injuring themselves or others with  guns about how to deal with it more safely.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you're not an expert on guns.  Would it make you  uncomfortable if I gave you medical advice?</p><p> LAINE:  Yes, that would make pretty uncomfortable.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes, me too.  That's why I wouldn't do it.</p><p> LAINE:  I'm not an expert on guns, but I am a medical expert.  And part of  what physicians do is to assess risk and then help talk to their patients  about mitigating those risks.</p><p> CARLSON:  Oh, assess risks.  Like, when you guys send tens of millions of  doses of opioids into Appalachia and killed over 100,000 people.  That kind  of risk.  Where were you then?  Just wondering.  I can't help it since you  bragged about your risk assessment abilities.</p><p> LAINE:  Well, risk assessment - we do assess risk.  And it wasn't doctors  that sent tens of millions of doses of opioids to Appalachia or other  places.  </p><p> But we do assess risks.  We assess risks of high blood pressure, smoking,  risky sexual behavior that people puts at risk for infections.  When people  are elderly and at risk for falls, we ask about area rugs in the home.  We  talk to patients about seat belts.  There are lots of different risks that  we assess.</p><p> And this proposal is to remind physicians that when they have a patient who  is at risk for harming themselves or others to ask about whether they have  guns in the home and then talk to them about more safely storing those guns  or other interventions that can make them and their families safer.</p><p> CARLSON:  Would you acknowledge that there are people who ought to have a  gun in the home?  Like, if you live alone in a tough area where there's a  lot of crime, home invasions, would you ever say it's probably better to  have some way to defend yourself?</p><p> LAINE:  As a physician, I would not.  I don't think that that would be in  my purview to do.  It's certainly people's right in this country.  But if  that person was at risk of harming themselves or others, then I would be  counseling them that maybe it would not be safe to have a gun in their  home.</p><p> CARLSON:  But what if they were at risk of being harmed?  I mean, if the  point of this is harm reduction, as you claimed it was, then if someone was  a delivery man, for example, in a tough neighborhood delivering the  newspaper or delivering to bodegas at 3:00 a.m.  in the morning, wouldn't  you say it's probably better to be armed?</p><p> LAINE:  Actually, Tucker, there are data out there that show that if people  have access to a gun in their home, it doesn't actually keep them safer.   They're at much higher risk for a completed suicide or for a gun homicide.   People that have guns in their home.</p><p> So, it's easy to say that your assumption that having a gun in your hope  keeps your safer, there really are data that refute that assumption.</p><p> CARLSON:  I don't think you know the data really because when you take  suicide out of that, it's a totally different picture.  And that's a  separate question I'd love to ask you about, whether you're against suicide  and trying to prevent suicide.  </p><p> But let me just ask you, are you saying that there is no circumstance where  someone is safer with a gun?  Is that your medical position?</p><p> LAINE:  No.  What I was saying is that, in a systematic review published in  the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" that looked at 16 studies that evaluated  the risk of a completed suicide or a gun homicide by whether or not the  person had access to guns in the home that the risk for both those things,  a completed suicide and a gun homicide, was higher in individuals - </p><p> CARLSON:  I'm familiar with those statistics and they're misleading, so I'm  a little surprised that you're citing them because I think serious people  know that.</p><p> But let me just ask you this.  if I said, I live at the end - I'm disabled  and I live at the end of a long road where the police can't get there  within ten minutes, there have been home invasions, I feel I need to  protect myself, I feel I need a gun, would you actually say no, you don't  need a gun?  What would be your advice?</p><p> LAINE:  I think that's the patient's choice.  But if that patient was  depressed and at risk for suicide or was having homicidal ideation or had  cognitive deficits, I would probably counsel them that it was more safe for  them not to have a gun than have a gun.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I think that's fair.  I mean, if you're worried the person  is going to kill himself, I think you're absolutely right.</p><p> So, you as an organization have taken a strong position against suicide, it  sounds like, is that right?</p><p> LAINE:  Yes.</p><p> CARLSON:  No.  I mean, not all physicians have.  </p><p> LAINE:  I don't think there are too many physicians that are for suicide.   I don't think there are too many physicians out there that advocate  suicide, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, like the entire state of Oregon where it's  legal and a lot of physicians participate in it and advocated for.  So,  yes, there are a lot of physicians in this country and in Europe who are  for suicide, as you know.</p><p> LAINE:  Tucker, you're talking about a completely different issue.  You're  talking about assisted suicide for people that have terminal illness and  are at the end of their life.  That really has nothing to do with the gun -</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, people shoot themselves with guns all the  time when they're in terminal pain or facing a terminal illness.  You're  just saying suicide is OK with a physician, but not alone.  Is that your  position?  I'm just trying to get to the nub of what you believe.</p><p> LAINE:  I think suicide with a gun is always pretty messy and it's not  something that physicians support.  </p><p> And one of the things that's lost in this - </p><p> CARLSON:  But suicide with a needle is OK.</p><p> LAINE:  What?</p><p> CARLSON:  Suicide with a needle can be OK, but suicide with a gun is always  wrong because it's messy?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p> LAINE:  No, no.  It's wrong because even physician-assisted suicide is not  done with injection drugs.  You're talking about euthanasia, which is not  legal in this country.</p><p> CARLSON:  OK.  Well, you're dead at the end no matter what.  So, it doesn't  seem morally a different category to me.  But, obviously, you disagree.  </p><p> Dr.  Laine, thanks for coming on.</p><p> LAINE:  I thought we were going to talk about firearm injury?</p><p> CARLSON:  Well, we were, but the majority, of course, of firearm deaths are  suicides, as you said.  And so, you're trying to protect people from that,  again, as you said.  So, I was trying to get to the nub of what you believe  because I don't think it's enough to come on and spew platitudes.  I think  it's important to explain precisely what you believe and what you mean.   So, I was trying to get you to do that.</p><p> LAINE:  OK.  So, if you give me an opportunity, I will.  So, what this - </p><p> CARLSON:  I think I have.  Doctor, I think I've given you, I don't know,  six or seven minutes.  And I think you've had a chance to explain it.  And  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p> Well, the NRA says it's fed up with dishonest journalists and is warning  them their time is running out.  What does that mean?  Dana Loesch joins us  next.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  In a new advertisement, the National Rifle Association warns left  wing journalists that \"time is running out for them.\" Here it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON:  To every lying member of the media, to  every Hollywood phony, to the role model athletes who use their free speech  to alter and undermine what our flag represents, to the politicians who  would rather watch America burn than lose one ounce of their own personal  power, to the late night hosts who think their opinions are the only  opinions that matter, to the Joy-Ann Reids, the Morning Joes, the Mikas, to  those who stain honest reporting with partisanship, to those who bring bias  and propaganda to \"CNN\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\",  your time is running out.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON:  That's Dana Loesch.  Of course, in the ad, she speaks for the NRA  and she joins us tonight.  Dana, thanks for coming on.</p><p> LOESCH:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON:  So, you are being criticized for inciting violence, some say, by  that phrase \"time is up.\" What does that mean?</p><p> LOESCH:  Well, time's up, of course, is a play on the Time's Up movement,  the Hollywood progressivism that, for so long, tolerated and celebrated  people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p> But, also, at the very end of that video there, Tucker, it was an  announcement for a program that I'm doing for \"NRA TV\" because I think a  free people have the right to hold accountable and to frisk and fact check  a free press.  And so, that's what it's all about.</p><p> Now, to be clear, I don't believe in universal statements.  And that's why,  those people in the media and those people in Hollywood who are pushing  propaganda or who are lying, yes, this is an indictment of you.</p><p> And the program for \"NRA TV\", which launches at the end of this month,  Tucker, is focusing on media malpractice and holding accountable that media  malpractice, which we have seen tons of, particularly in the past year.</p><p> CARLSON:  Where do you think that comes from?  Where do you think the gut  level animist you see in the media toward NRA, toward gun owners, where  does that come from?</p><p> LOESCH:  I think it's just - honestly, I think that there are a lot of  people who don't understand middle America.  I think that they don't  understand individuals who are Second Amendment practitioners.</p><p> I mean, you've talked about this on your show before, Tucker.  And I edited  under Andrew Breitbart big journalism for this very reason.  I was entirely  fed up with mainstream media, legacy media and the malpractice thereof.</p><p> And we saw how they disparaged and impugned the characters of those people,  the members of the Tea Party.  We saw them ignore, malign black  conservatives.  They ignore and malign conservative women.  They ignore and  malign gay conservatives.</p><p> And they bash good people in fly-over nation who are good enough to vote  for the Clintons for how many years?  But then, when they turn around and  they vote for Donald Trump, suddenly, Tucker, those people become bigots  and racists.</p><p> And we've watched media malign so many good Americans and seem to only  report one side of the story.</p><p> I mean, for instance, just look at everything that's happened with  Parkland.  Where is the media focusing on the Broward sheriff, for  instance, fighting the \"Miami Herald\" who has done epic work, they've done  amazing work in this story?</p><p> They've filed a lawsuit against the Broward Sheriff's Office trying to get  this video that the sheriff once promised that he was going to release.   Where is the focus on that?  </p><p> Or the political class that has let the mental crisis spiral out of  control?  Instead, honestly, Tucker, you know what they're writing about?   They're writing about my musical taste in \"Newsweek\" and focusing on my  appearance and me as a person and my husband and law-abiding gun owners  across the United States instead of doing their due diligence and acting  like the watchdog of the people.</p><p> So, who watches the watchers?  That's the question.</p><p> CARLSON:  If you're going to try and take people's guns away, don't you  think you have a moral obligation - and prevent them from protecting  themselves, don't you think you have an obligation to protect them better  than our elites are now doing?</p><p> LOESCH:  Yes.  That's what I don't understand.  Here we're looking at  multiple systemic failures coming from the government that failed to  protect us, all the while we have all of these individuals telling us,  well, you can trust the government to protect you.</p><p> Well, really?  They didn't with Sutherland Springs and they didn't with  Garland, Texas and they didn't with San Bernardino and they didn't with the  Navy Yard and they didn't in Charleston.  I could go on and on because  there were balls dropped in every single one of those instance, Tucker.  </p><p> And the political class has been largely silent.  They haven't been -</p><p> CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p> LOESCH:  They haven't been moved to make sure that the background check  system works, like Wayne LaPierre has called for 25 years to do.  And so, I  mean, this is where the focus - that's where - honestly, that's where the  focus should be in all of this.</p><p> CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p> LOESCH:  But to the point of people trying to say that somehow fact  checking media is violent, the progressive left has been violent for a very  long time.  And I can't take seriously the criticisms of people, Tucker,  who ignored the fires in Ferguson and they ignored Antifa violence and they  ignored so many other things and now they want to act like it's threatening  to fact check media.</p><p> CARLSON:  I'm just laughing because if you're asking sincere questions  about the people in charge, you're, obviously, working for Vladimir Putin.   So, good luck with your new Russian masters, Dana.</p><p> LOESCH:  I had Russian salad dressing earlier this week.  So, I guess, I'm  a spy or something.</p><p> CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  Thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.</p><p> Facebook is moving forward with a new messaging app designed to get your  children hooked on social media and rearrange their brains completely.  Can  anything stop big tech?  We'll ask someone who is trying.  Stay tuned.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  15 years ago, Facebook didn't exist.  Today, it dominates our  lives, shapes our conversation, even to some extent determines the way we  think.  Americans spend close to an hour every single day on Facebook.  But  the company wants more.</p><p> Facebook is rolling out a new app messenger for kids.  It's aimed at  children as young as six.  More than 100 child developments experts have  warned this is a bad idea.  Could be a disaster.  It serves to addict kids  to social media earlier than ever.  </p><p> It has massive implications for our society.  The company seems to be  ignoring that.  Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense and wrote the book  \"Talking Back to Facebook\" and he joins us tonight.</p><p> Jim, thanks for coming on.  Have I mischaracterized what this app is  intended to do and who it's aimed at?</p><p> JIM STEYER, COMMON SENSE MEDIA CEO:  Nope.  I think you nailed it, Tucker.   I mean, really, this is about social media for the kindergarten set.  It's  basically getting hooked kids at younger and younger ages - 6, 7, 8 - on  social media platforms like Facebook and it's crazy.  We don't need it.   And that's why all the experts came out and suggested that.</p><p> CARLSON:  But we know that heavy social media use among young people leads  to social maladjustment, depression, maybe even more grave things.  I mean,  the implication is certainly that it can really hurt people, gravely hurt  them.</p><p> So, why would Facebook want to do this?</p><p> STEYER:  Because it's in their own economic best interest.  I mean,  truthfully, you're trying to hook people at younger and younger ages to the  brand and to the concept, and so it's an economic incentive.  But,  obviously, it's missing out on all the negative unintended consequences  that you just referred to.</p><p> I mean, this is just a no-brainer for a parent.  Why would you want your  six-year-old using Facebook or Instagram?  So, this is just - should be a  non-starter for parents.</p><p> CARLSON:  I mean, I'm sure R.J.  Reynolds would like to come out with a new  cigarette that's kindergarten friendly, but we say, no, you can't.  I mean,  adults can decide to do that if they want, but our society does not allow  cigar makers to sell to children.  Why are we allowing Facebook to do this  when we know it harms them?</p><p> STEYER:  Well, I think it's a very apt comparison.  And it's like candy- coated cigarettes.  So, you want to hook kids at younger and younger ages.</p><p> So, we actually at Common Sense think this is not a good idea at all.  And  it also brings up the broader issue of how do you get your kids - you're a  parent too, Tucker.  How do you get your kids away from the screen,  enjoying the incredible outdoors and world around them?  You just don't  want sitting on social media platforms in kindergarten or actually at any  age.</p><p> CARLSON:  Yes.  I mean, we know that it affects kids' ability to read and  retain information and to think clearly.  So, is there any legislative  effort to pull back?  Are we just passive in the face of a threat to our  children?</p><p> STEYER:  Actually, Tucker, there's a lot of good stuff coming on this kind  of issue.  There's stuff here on the West Coast in terms of looking at the  addiction research that needs to be done around social media platforms.  </p><p> You're seeing much greater privacy concern now.  You're seeing a number of  different legislative efforts to try to either encourage or require  companies to respect the young kids in their audience.  And that's going to  grow.</p><p> We passed a bill called the Eraser Button here in California couple of  years ago, so that kids who made dumb decisions could erase them.  So, I  think you're going to see a growing public outcry.  And I think your  covering it helps in that as well.</p><p> CARLSON:  I hope so.  I mean, I can just see them marketing Google Maps to  babies to learn how to crawl.  We're losing a lot in this.  And, Jim, thank  you for sounding the call about it.  Appreciate it.</p><p> STEYER:  Well, thank you for having us on, Tucker, and thanks for your  supporting it as well.  We like it.</p><p> CARLSON:  Always.  Well, we've got a major announcement about something  starting tomorrow on the show.  We'll tell you what it is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON:  We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country and, of  course, we're totally for that.  We're for empowering all Americans.</p><p> But, for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are  doing in America.  So, we took a close look at the numbers.  And we found  them so shocking that we're devoting the month of March to a special series  on men in America.  Every Wednesday starting tomorrow, you'll be stunned by  the scope of the crisis.  We were.  It's a largely ignored disaster.  And  it is a disaster.  It affects every person in America.</p><p> Hope you'll be also heartened by some of the potential solutions we're  looking at.  We kick off tomorrow night with renowned psychologist and  thinker Jordan Peterson every Wednesday at 8:00.  I hope you'll joining us  starting tomorrow.  </p><p> Tune in every night to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Thanks for a great hour.  Good night  from Washington.  Sean Hannity right now.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"HANNITY\":  Lying, pomposity, smugness,  groupthink, I got it.  I totally got it.</p><p> CARLSON:  That's the spirit, Sean.</p><p> Hannity:  All right, Tucker.  Thank you.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We'll have the latest on that in just a  minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, first tonight, former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg went on  television yesterday and the news world ground to a halt.  Nothing else  happened.  Americans stopped dying of drug ODs, the world's post-war order  stopped collapsing, robots stopped taking our jobs, the borders were secure  because for most of the day, all that mattered was Sam Nunberg.  Watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, \" ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\":  Good evening.  I'm Erin  Burnett, \"OutFront\".  Tonight, breaking news.

Russian bots, non-English speakers for  sure.  Sam Nunberg speaking out.</p><p>Who is Sam Nunberg exactly?  Well, I'll tell you.  Just yesterday, he was a  pretty obscure part-time political consultant from New York City, who has  apparently been struggling with a substance abuse problem.</p><p>He's actually a pretty nice guy, but you have probably never heard of him.   Almost nobody had heard of him.  And now, the media are telling you that  Nunberg could be the key to this whole scandal.  The John Dean of this fake  Watergate.  Except that, unlike John Dean, Nunberg was nowhere near the  decisions when they were made.</p><p>He worked at a low level of the Trump campaign before it was actually a  campaign.  He left almost a year-and-a-half before the election.  If there  was indeed a Russia conspiracy, Sam Nunberg would not know anything about  it.</p><p>More likely, what was going on yesterday, Nunberg brilliantly played the  press because it turns out, this Friday, he's talking to Robert Mueller's  investigators, which is yet another measure of how absurd this independent  counsel investigation is, if you're talking to Sam Nunberg.</p><p>Others, though, have been charged with perjury after doing interviews with  Mueller's investigators.  Nunberg will not be.  Why?  Because he just  admitted in public to being an alcoholic and then acted like a lunatic on  television for hours.</p><p>It is the perfect preemptive insanity defense.  Mueller can't indict him.   After yesterday, no jury would convict Sam Nunberg.  Was that Nunberg's  plan?  Well, we don't know really.  But if it was, none of the people  interviewing him yesterday would have figured it out because there's nobody  dumber than most cable news hosts at \"CNN\" and \"MSNBC\".</p><p>How dumb?  Well, dumb enough to see Russian saboteurs under every bed.   Russia, the place, the actual country, is grim and hopeless.  It's got a  lower than replacement birth date.  It's got waning power on the world  stage.  It has one military base outside its borders.  It's not a major  player anymore.  </p><p>But the imaginary Russia, the one you see on television every night, has  never been more powerful.  At the DNC and \"NBC News\", Vladimir Putin is  diabolical and omnipotent.  Putin put Trump in office.  He gave the Senate  nomination in Alabama to Roy Moore somehow.  He empowered the NRA.  He  likely handpicked seasoned masters of espionage like Sam Nunberg and Carter  Page to undermine our democracy.</p><p>It's delusional, but they fervently believe it.  Meanwhile back in the real  world, evidence mounts that the actual problem is not the Russians or  Vladimir Putin, it is the corrupt and decadent and resolutely stupid  leadership of our own elites.</p><p>That is why Trump got elected, in reaction to them.  That's why the  European Union is in the process of collapsing.</p><p>Just this weekend, in Italy, while we're all talking about Sam Nunberg, the  ruling party there was crushed, while antiestablishment candidates won big.   Voters, the polls showed, were deeply unhappy with economic policies that  have enriched a few, while stealing the future from young people.</p><p>They hated the immigration policies that have crushed their national  culture under waves of migrants.  Sound familiar?  Well, there, as here,  the elites have failed.</p><p>But they can't admit that?  They can't face their own failure.  So,  instead, they blame the unseen hand of Russia.</p><p>Former Obama official Samantha Power actually said that out loud in a  tweet.  Russia won the Italian election, she explained.  Well, maybe  Samantha Power and her friends at \"MSNBC\" and the rest have no choice but  to keep pretending.</p><p>If our ruling class admitted the sad truth about Russia, they'd have to  take responsibility for their own ineptitude and failures and they won't.   And so, the insanity continues.</p><p>Christy Setzer is a Democratic strategist, president of New Heights  Communications and a connoisseur of the Russia story and she joins us  tonight.</p><p>So, Christy, this Italian thing happened.  And I'm not saying it's the most  important thing to happen this year, but it's another domino that is  leading clearly toward the dissolution of the European Union, toward the  order in Europe and in this country, by the way.  Russia did that?</p><p>CHRISTY SETZER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's possible that they played a  role.  It's possible.  What we have seen - and these two things can both be  true at the same time.  It can, one, be true that organically,  independently, we are seeing, across the globe, these movements that are  populist, that are anti-immigrant that have a lot of different things in  common.</p><p>And also, it's being true that Russia is sort of stirring the pot.  We have  recently found out that a Russian troll farm was spending a million dollars  a month in 2016 in the US elections to sort of, again, stir the pot, to  influence our elections by supporting Donald Trump and going -</p><p>CARLSON:  The democrats spend over a billion - look, I'm not saying that  Russia is not trying to destabilize the United States.  What I'm saying is  it's irrelevant.  And if you look at the actual poll numbers, they show  pretty consistently in a lot of different countries that people are  dissatisfied with the leadership of the people in charge.</p><p>And that's why Trump got elected.  That's why Brexit happened.  That's why  Scandinavia is about to turn.  That's why we almost had Marine Le Pen in  France.</p><p>And in each one of these cases, the elites rather than accept  responsibility, blame an unseen foreign hand.  You don't see a thread here?</p><p>SETZER:  I think, as I just said, that both things can be true.  It's true,  on one hand, that there was unrest among the country that was unhappy with  the leaders that they have been given for the last, I don't know, decade,  couple of decades.</p><p>At the same time, it's also true that Russia has been grooming Donald Trump  for years.  At least that's what the Steele dossier says.</p><p>CARLSON:  Hold on.  I don't think it's fair or honest to say that the  allegation is Russia is just helping populist or right-wing movements like  Trump or Berlusconi or Marine Le Pen.</p><p>The claim is also that the Russians were helping Bernie Sanders.  Right?   And that they were helping Jill Stein.</p><p>SETZER:  They were helping anti-Hillary Clinton.  That's what they were  doing.</p><p>CARLSON:  They are paying for the most left-wing cable station there is,  \"RT\".  So, it's a little more complicated.  </p><p>So, \"Rolling Stone\" -</p><p>SETZER:  It's a pro-Russia station.  It's not necessarily left wing.  The  two are not the same.</p><p>CARLSON:  Maybe the obvious is true, which is that people in charge as  represented by the morning show on \"MSNBC\", you know what I mean, like the  people who have been making policy for the past 30 years haven't taken into  account the views of voters and voters are mad about that.</p><p>And so, rather than like learn something from what's happening, they're  blaming forces that aren't there, the Russians.</p><p>SETZER:  The Russian forces are, in fact, there.  And I think all you have  to do is listen to not just Samantha Power, you can listen to any one of -  you can listen to our own secretary of state.  You can listen to Rex  Tillerson.  </p><p>CARLSON:  But I don't care because none of those people is wise beginning  with Samantha Power, whose foreign policy has left the region in tatters.</p><p>SETZER:  She is also not in power.</p><p>CARLSON:  She's not.  But she's implicated in the disaster that is the  world 2018 that democratic voters in democratic nations across the West are  reacting against.  </p><p>So, do you think there's any coincidence that the Russia hoax is being used  to discredit anybody not on the right, but anybody who challenges power.   You ever notice that?</p><p>SETZER:  Obviously, I deeply disagree with calling it a Russia hoax.   Again, if we can go back to what the origins of Russia \"hoax\" were, it went  back to well-before the 2016 election.</p><p>But that's when we first learned about it, was, as you may remember, from  one of the debates with Hillary Clinton when she talked about 17  intelligence agencies in the US have all concluded that Russia has been  trying to meddle.  And I hate that word because it's so weak.  But have  been trying to influence US elections.  </p><p>We didn't listen to that story because -</p><p>CARLSON:  No evidence has emerged from that date till now that it's real.   I want you to think about something that was written in \"Rolling Stone\"  today by a very left-wing writer.  This is someone who hates Trump, who is  a full-on lefty and he said this.</p><p>\"By an amazing coincidence, virtually all the anti-system movements and  candidates that so terrified the political establishment just two years ago  have since been identified as covert or overt Russian destabilization  initiatives run by Putin.\"</p><p>It's not clear to you that this is a reaction against voters who are mad  because nothing is working for them.  And rather than listen to them, the  elites are like, oh, it's not our fault, it's Putin's fault.  You don't see  that at all.</p><p>SETZER:  I think - one more time -</p><p>CARLSON:  Or you just think that's part of it or no?  I keep asking the  question because I'm amazed that someone as smart as you doesn't see that  what ties claims that implicate Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump is maybe  defensiveness on the part of the people in power.  You don't see that?</p><p>SETZER:  I believe that both things are true.  I believe that there is  populist unrest in our country in 2016.  I also believe that the Russians  both saw that, leveraged it, took advantage of it and kind of fanned the  flames of it, so that they could install somebody that they saw as willing  to - </p><p>CARLSON:  But there's no evidence they did that.</p><p>SETZER:  There's plenty of evidence that they did that.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's insane.</p><p>CARLSON:  Go back to the Trump Tower meeting.  They were offered -</p><p>CARLSON:  I can't even - wanted to keep this at a higher level because when  we get right down to the details, it gets so frustrating that I can't  continue.  Christy, thank you so much.</p><p>SETZER:  Tucker, thank you.</p><p>Brit Hume is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us.  Brit, you've  been in the media for a long time and television for many decades.</p><p>When you saw Sam Nunberg on yesterday, did you think to yourself, I would  have put him on if I were a bureau chief or I wouldn't have put him on if I  were bureau chief?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I very much hoped,  Tucker, that I would not have.  And it was worth noting that, before the  day was over, \"CNN's\" Erin Burnett had looked at him and said, I smell  liquor on your breath.  Could she have been the first and only \"CNN\" anchor  to notice that the guy was probably drunk?</p><p>Not only that.  He's plainly a very troubled soul.</p><p>As a journalist, when you come along, you don't have to make a psychiatric  diagnosis to recognize that somebody you're talking to may not be OK and  that whatever this person says may be indeed questionable.</p><p>And yet this guy held sway over the airwaves, as you pointed out earlier,  for hours on end, particularly on \"CNN\", but I guess others picked it up  and it got quite a ride yesterday.  </p><p>And, of course, the principal thing that made the headline, Tucker, was  when he said that he wasn't going to cooperate with Mueller.  Well, by this  morning, that was gone all and he said indeed he was going to cooperate  with Mueller.  As a matter of fact, he has very little choice.</p><p>But that was a non-story that lived all day long because it feeds this  whole narrative that there's something terribly wrong and that we have an  unqualified president under the influence of Russia and God knows what  else.</p><p>CARLSON:  And so, to make that point, you have someone who is under the  influence of alcohol to jump around the set and humiliate himself.  And not  only that, degrade the person who is interviewing him.  I wonder if there's  a cost long-term when you do stuff like that.</p><p>HUME:  Well, Tucker, what we're looking at here is that there's been a  belief for the longest time that the Trump election was illegitimate and  there's been a sense in the media that his election constitutes a kind of  national emergency because he's such an unqualified character, and so  likely to lead us off a cliff that it is the job of the media to join the  resistance and to find out what must be behind his election and what  scandals must lurk there in order really to take him down.</p><p>I mean, I think that's plainly what this is all about.  The media have  clearly joined the resistance.  And the coverage of this, I think, has  been, in the mainstream media at least, extremely one-sided, a lot of it  misguided.  There have been any number of stories that turned out badly all  along the way.</p><p>You'll remember \"CNN\", the group of their senior people sitting that they  had word that when Comey testified that he was going to testify that he had  never told Donald Trump that he was not under investigation and the next  day, of course, Comey came out and testified just the opposite.</p><p>You wonder how stories like that - and there have been several of them -  can possibly get past these seasoned journalists if they're not on a  crusade.  And I think they are.</p><p>CARLSON:  I remember when the Russians hacked the national power grid.  Do  you think it might help - oh, but they didn't, of course.  Do you think it  might help the rest of us who are getting agitated watching this just to  remind ourselves that what you're seeing is political advocacy?  There's no  expectation of objectivity or news.  What you're watching is one side  waging partisan battle against the other?</p><p>HUME:  Yes.  But it's strikingly effective.  Your previous guest, she  really didn't want to let go of the narrative that's out there that Russia  had an important effect on the election.</p><p>The evidence of that, as you pointed out, is extremely light at best.   Anything that Russia did to the tune of even a million dollars a month is  dwarfed by the rest of the spending and the other things that influenced  the outcome of elections.</p><p>But it's something that is held on to for dear life.  And I think it's the  story of coverage.  I think it's enraged the people who see things more  clearly than that, but on and on it goes.</p><p>You see it particularly in the character assassination of Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has had to put up with  unbelievable assaults on him.  And they continue to this day that he's the  guy who is at fault when you know that, on the Democratic side, feeding the  press, there's this unbelievable leak fest out of that committee and it  goes on and on.  Not a proud moment for the America news media in my  judgment.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's true.  Heilemann over at \"MSNBC\" called Nunes \"a Russian  agent\".  Two years ago, you'd be fired for saying something like that if  you couldn't support it, but he's, obviously, not going to.</p><p>HUME:  It borders on hysteria.  It's just so over the top.  I mean, you  don't have to be a Trump admirer to realize that the things that are being  said are just wildly out of proportion to anything real beneath them.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, it's insane.  I know people who hate Trump who agree with  that completely, to be honest.  Brit, thank you very much.</p><p>HUME:  You bet, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  We've got a Fox News alert.  Another fixture of the Trump  administration is stepping down.  National Economic Council Director Gary  Cohn says he's planning to leave the administration.  Why?</p><p>Well, Fox chief national correspondent Ed Henry joins us tonight with  details.  Hi, ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Tucker, great to see you.   Shortly after fresh denial from President Trump, there's simply no truth to  the idea that he can't bring stability to his White House, his lead  economic adviser is heading for the exits.</p><p>Well, the president is right that there's turnover in every White House,  Democrat or Republican, there's been a particularly large number of  departures lately from Hope Hicks to Rob Porter, multiple press  secretaries, communications directors, national security advisers and  chiefs of staff.</p><p>What's significant about Gary Cohn is he was a key architect of the tax  cut, plus the regulatory reform that has really propelled this economy with  the markets getting a lot more volatile in recent weeks.  There's no  denying this a big loss for the president.</p><p>And while he lost a high-profile battle to try and stop the president from  moving forward on those tariffs on aluminum and steel, White House  officials tonight are insisting Cohn is not running out just because of  that one dispute.</p><p>But, in fact, it was two months ago today, the president boasted he wanted  Cohn to stick around for a \"long time\".  </p><p>This is going to feed the mainstream media narrative you've been talking  about that there's chaos at the White House, but as the president noted  today, he likes conflict, he likes different points of view on trade, other  issues.  Diversity of thought, after all, is something that's supposed to  be celebrated.</p><p>And it was former chief of staff Reince Priebus who said over the weekend,  critics may pounce on a meandering process of the White House, but the  focus should be on the results the president is getting.  Not sure a lot of  people will agree with that or report that, but that is what his former  chief of staff said, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Ed Henry, ladies and gentlemen.  </p><p>HENRY:  Good to see you.</p><p>CARLSON:  Good to see you.  Thanks.  </p><p>Top Republicans in the House are tonight demanding a new special prosecutor  to investigate abuses of civil liberties by the FBI.  What does that mean?   Will it happen?  We've got details coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Top House Republicans are tonight formally calling for a second  special counsel.  House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and  Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia say a new investigation, an  independent one, is needed to look into abuses of FISA surveillance during  and after the 2016 election.</p><p>Joe diGenova is a former US attorney for the District of Columbia and he  joins us tonight.  So, Joe, just bottom line it, you know a lot about  special counsels.  Are you for this or no?</p><p>JOE DIGENOVA, ATTORNEY:  Absolutely.  It has to happen because the  inspector general to whom this investigation has been given has no subpoena  power, he has no authority to interview anybody outside the Department of  Justice or FBI, he cannot even interview FBI and DOJ employees who have  left.</p><p>He cannot interview Clapper, Brennan, any of the people associated with it.   He can't interview all the people that have left, Yates, all those people.</p><p>So, the bottom line is, you have to have a grand jury.  It's fascinating.   We have a grand jury and a special counsel in Russiagate where there's been  no crime committed and here, with the FISA violations, where there have  been huge numbers of crimes committed by various people in various  departments, we have no grand jury.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, part of the reason you have a special counsel is to restore a  public faith in the system itself.  It seems to be making public the FISA  request for the warrants would go a long way to ending the debate over all  this.  Can that happen?  Will it happen?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  It should happen.  I cannot conceive of anything that is in  those affidavits that would compromise sources and methods.  It's ludicrous  that they haven't been released.  They should be released.  The American  people have a right to see them.</p><p>Because remember, Tucker, what this is all about, and FISA is just part of  it, there was a brazen plot by senior officials at DOJ and FBI in the Obama  administration and senior Obama administration intelligence officials to  exonerate Hillary Clinton falsely and then to frame Donald Trump if Hillary  lost the election.</p><p>We need a grand jury.  We need the FISA applications out.  We need it all  done, and we need it done now.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, here's a new angle in this and I want to get your response to  it.  So, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who still works at the bureau, I think, in  human resources, may have known about a breach of Hillary Clinton's private  e-mail server, but apparently didn't do anything about it.</p><p>Sources have told Fox News that, during the final months of the FBI's  investigation into Hillary Clinton's server, irregularities in the server's  metadata were found and that indicated a potential breach.  </p><p>Strzok, who was overseeing that investigation, took no action in response,  according to our sources.  Maybe he was too busy sending anti-Trump text  messages to his mistress or whatever.</p><p>Does that seem out of the ordinary to you?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  It's absolutely out of the ordinary.  And here's what happened  on top of that.  James Clapper, who was the director of national  intelligence under Obama, when he found out that Hillary Clinton's server  had been compromised, they're required by law to conduct a damage  assessment, to see whether or not sources and methods have been  compromised.</p><p>He refused.  Clapper refused to do a damage assessment, and that is why  Strzok decided not to investigate the compromise of Hillary's server.</p><p>CARLSON:  On what grounds did Clapper, who by the way is the same one who  under oath lied to Congress and the public about spying on Americans, on  what grounds did he refuse to do a damage assessment?</p><p>DIGENOVA:  Because he wanted to protect Hillary and he could do it and he  had the consent of the president not to do an assessment.</p><p>And by that, I mean, the consent of President Obama.</p><p>CARLSON:  Wow, that's pretty shocking.  Thank you, Joe.  I appreciate that.</p><p>DIGENOVA:  Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, a group of physicians are calling on doctors to shame gun  owners during checkups.  Kind of an amazing story.  It may happen.  Stay  tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  Most cable new shows are pretty varied.  They cover a lot of  topics.  But over on \"MSNBC\", Joy Reid's show is the exception.  Her show  has only one topic.  How everyone who disagrees with her is a racist.  </p><p>She's not a civil right advocate.  She's just a monomaniac.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY REID, \"MSNBC\" HOST, \"AM JOY\":  It's been no secret that Trump harbors  racist attitudes about brown and black people in the US and other parts of  the world.</p><p>We're just another Western nation falling to the ethno-nationalist forces  sweeping across Europe, feeding on the fear of non-white and non-Christian  immigrants.</p><p>Trump ushers in an emboldened KKK and an alt-right that will soon have a  place in the White House.</p><p>We grapple with what it means to have a president stained by racism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, that's the whole show really every week.  So, there's no  need for you to watch, though you might be tempted.</p><p>But when you're Joy Reid, the answer to every question, no matter what it  is, bigotry.  The only variable is volume.</p><p>This past weekend, she melted down completely over a joke the president  told about Nancy Pelosi.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID:  He reportedly also said that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to come up  with a line as good as \"lock her up\" and that her line, says Donald Trump,  that she announced last week is \"mow the grass.\" Mow the freaking grass.   That isn't going to stop MS-13.  Mow the freakin' grass.</p><p>That sounds like an aspersion or a slap at immigrants, at Mexican- Americans.  At least, that's how I'm reading it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  At least, that's how I'm reading it.  Of course, you're reading  it that way.  </p><p>Of course, back in reality, Trump was just ridiculing Pelosi over a  proposal that the boarder can be kept secure with proper lawn care.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We all have a responsibility to  protect our borders.  Should there be fencing?  Should there be technology?   Should they mow the grass, so that people can't hide in it, let's talk  about where a more serious structure might be necessary, where fencing will  do or mowing grass, so people can't be smuggled through the grass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  So, is Pelosi the secret grand wizard.  We'll see if Joy Reid  denounces her.  Of course, she'll denounce us too.  Can't wait.</p><p>Are you ready to get a gun control lecture next time you go to the doctor?   Well, a recent editorial in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" urges  physicians to start publicly campaigning for gun control, while also  pestering their patients about how unsafe it is to own guns.</p><p>The editorial says \"don't let your concerns for perceived political  consequences get in the way for advocating for the well-being of your  patients and the public.\"</p><p>Dr.  Christine Laine is editor in chief of the \"Annals of Internal  Medicine\" and she co-authored that piece and she joins us tonight.  Doctor,  thanks for coming on.</p><p>DR.  CHRISTINE LAINE, PHYSICIAN:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, I was reading about this and you all said that, over at the  annals, that the massacre in Las Vegas urged you to do this.  And it got me  thinking, would this have presented that?  Do you think if you had told  Stephen Paddock that guns are dangerous that he wouldn't have opened fire?</p><p>LAINE:  No.  And that's not exactly what our proposal is.  Our proposal is  to treat firearm injury like a public health problem that it has become.   And one opportunity to do that is for in the exam rooms for doctors to talk  to their patients who are at risk for injuring themselves or others with  guns about how to deal with it more safely.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you're not an expert on guns.  Would it make you  uncomfortable if I gave you medical advice?</p><p>LAINE:  Yes, that would make pretty uncomfortable.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes, me too.  That's why I wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAINE:  I'm not an expert on guns, but I am a medical expert.  And part of  what physicians do is to assess risk and then help talk to their patients  about mitigating those risks.</p><p>CARLSON:  Oh, assess risks.  Like, when you guys send tens of millions of  doses of opioids into Appalachia and killed over 100,000 people.  That kind  of risk.  Where were you then?  Just wondering.  I can't help it since you  bragged about your risk assessment abilities.</p><p>LAINE:  Well, risk assessment - we do assess risk.  And it wasn't doctors  that sent tens of millions of doses of opioids to Appalachia or other  places.  </p><p>But we do assess risks.  We assess risks of high blood pressure, smoking,  risky sexual behavior that people puts at risk for infections.  When people  are elderly and at risk for falls, we ask about area rugs in the home.  We  talk to patients about seat belts.  There are lots of different risks that  we assess.</p><p>And this proposal is to remind physicians that when they have a patient who  is at risk for harming themselves or others to ask about whether they have  guns in the home and then talk to them about more safely storing those guns  or other interventions that can make them and their families safer.</p><p>CARLSON:  Would you acknowledge that there are people who ought to have a  gun in the home?  Like, if you live alone in a tough area where there's a  lot of crime, home invasions, would you ever say it's probably better to  have some way to defend yourself?</p><p>LAINE:  As a physician, I would not.  I don't think that that would be in  my purview to do.  It's certainly people's right in this country.  But if  that person was at risk of harming themselves or others, then I would be  counseling them that maybe it would not be safe to have a gun in their  home.</p><p>CARLSON:  But what if they were at risk of being harmed?  I mean, if the  point of this is harm reduction, as you claimed it was, then if someone was  a delivery man, for example, in a tough neighborhood delivering the  newspaper or delivering to bodegas at 3:00 a.m.  in the morning, wouldn't  you say it's probably better to be armed?</p><p>LAINE:  Actually, Tucker, there are data out there that show that if people  have access to a gun in their home, it doesn't actually keep them safer.   They're at much higher risk for a completed suicide or for a gun homicide.   People that have guns in their home.</p><p>So, it's easy to say that your assumption that having a gun in your hope  keeps your safer, there really are data that refute that assumption.</p><p>CARLSON:  I don't think you know the data really because when you take  suicide out of that, it's a totally different picture.  And that's a  separate question I'd love to ask you about, whether you're against suicide  and trying to prevent suicide.  </p><p>But let me just ask you, are you saying that there is no circumstance where  someone is safer with a gun?  Is that your medical position?</p><p>LAINE:  No.  What I was saying is that, in a systematic review published in  the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" that looked at 16 studies that evaluated  the risk of a completed suicide or a gun homicide by whether or not the  person had access to guns in the home that the risk for both those things,  a completed suicide and a gun homicide, was higher in individuals - </p><p>CARLSON:  I'm familiar with those statistics and they're misleading, so I'm  a little surprised that you're citing them because I think serious people  know that.</p><p>But let me just ask you this.  if I said, I live at the end - I'm disabled  and I live at the end of a long road where the police can't get there  within ten minutes, there have been home invasions, I feel I need to  protect myself, I feel I need a gun, would you actually say no, you don't  need a gun?  What would be your advice?</p><p>LAINE:  I think that's the patient's choice.  But if that patient was  depressed and at risk for suicide or was having homicidal ideation or had  cognitive deficits, I would probably counsel them that it was more safe for  them not to have a gun than have a gun.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I think that's fair.  I mean, if you're worried the person  is going to kill himself, I think you're absolutely right.</p><p>So, you as an organization have taken a strong position against suicide, it  sounds like, is that right?</p><p>LAINE:  Yes.</p><p>CARLSON:  No.  I mean, not all physicians have.  </p><p>LAINE:  I don't think there are too many physicians that are for suicide.   I don't think there are too many physicians out there that advocate  suicide, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, like the entire state of Oregon where it's  legal and a lot of physicians participate in it and advocated for.  So,  yes, there are a lot of physicians in this country and in Europe who are  for suicide, as you know.</p><p>LAINE:  Tucker, you're talking about a completely different issue.  You're  talking about assisted suicide for people that have terminal illness and  are at the end of their life.  That really has nothing to do with the gun -</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, I don't know, people shoot themselves with guns all the  time when they're in terminal pain or facing a terminal illness.  You're  just saying suicide is OK with a physician, but not alone.  Is that your  position?  I'm just trying to get to the nub of what you believe.</p><p>LAINE:  I think suicide with a gun is always pretty messy and it's not  something that physicians support.  </p><p>And one of the things that's lost in this - </p><p>CARLSON:  But suicide with a needle is OK.</p><p>LAINE:  What?</p><p>CARLSON:  Suicide with a needle can be OK, but suicide with a gun is always  wrong because it's messy?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>LAINE:  No, no.  It's wrong because even physician-assisted suicide is not  done with injection drugs.  You're talking about euthanasia, which is not  legal in this country.</p><p>CARLSON:  OK.  Well, you're dead at the end no matter what.  So, it doesn't  seem morally a different category to me.  But, obviously, you disagree.  </p><p>Dr.  Laine, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LAINE:  I thought we were going to talk about firearm injury?</p><p>CARLSON:  Well, we were, but the majority, of course, of firearm deaths are  suicides, as you said.  And so, you're trying to protect people from that,  again, as you said.  So, I was trying to get to the nub of what you believe  because I don't think it's enough to come on and spew platitudes.  I think  it's important to explain precisely what you believe and what you mean.   So, I was trying to get you to do that.</p><p>LAINE:  OK.  So, if you give me an opportunity, I will.  So, what this - </p><p>CARLSON:  I think I have.  Doctor, I think I've given you, I don't know,  six or seven minutes.  And I think you've had a chance to explain it.  And  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>Well, the NRA says it's fed up with dishonest journalists and is warning  them their time is running out.  What does that mean?  Dana Loesch joins us  next.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  In a new advertisement, the National Rifle Association warns left  wing journalists that \"time is running out for them.\" Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON:  To every lying member of the media, to  every Hollywood phony, to the role model athletes who use their free speech  to alter and undermine what our flag represents, to the politicians who  would rather watch America burn than lose one ounce of their own personal  power, to the late night hosts who think their opinions are the only  opinions that matter, to the Joy-Ann Reids, the Morning Joes, the Mikas, to  those who stain honest reporting with partisanship, to those who bring bias  and propaganda to \"CNN\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\",  your time is running out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON:  That's Dana Loesch.  Of course, in the ad, she speaks for the NRA  and she joins us tonight.  Dana, thanks for coming on.</p><p>LOESCH:  Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON:  So, you are being criticized for inciting violence, some say, by  that phrase \"time is up.\" What does that mean?</p><p>LOESCH:  Well, time's up, of course, is a play on the Time's Up movement,  the Hollywood progressivism that, for so long, tolerated and celebrated  people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>But, also, at the very end of that video there, Tucker, it was an  announcement for a program that I'm doing for \"NRA TV\" because I think a  free people have the right to hold accountable and to frisk and fact check  a free press.  And so, that's what it's all about.</p><p>Now, to be clear, I don't believe in universal statements.  And that's why,  those people in the media and those people in Hollywood who are pushing  propaganda or who are lying, yes, this is an indictment of you.</p><p>And the program for \"NRA TV\", which launches at the end of this month,  Tucker, is focusing on media malpractice and holding accountable that media  malpractice, which we have seen tons of, particularly in the past year.</p><p>CARLSON:  Where do you think that comes from?  Where do you think the gut  level animist you see in the media toward NRA, toward gun owners, where  does that come from?</p><p>LOESCH:  I think it's just - honestly, I think that there are a lot of  people who don't understand middle America.  I think that they don't  understand individuals who are Second Amendment practitioners.</p><p>I mean, you've talked about this on your show before, Tucker.  And I edited  under Andrew Breitbart big journalism for this very reason.  I was entirely  fed up with mainstream media, legacy media and the malpractice thereof.</p><p>And we saw how they disparaged and impugned the characters of those people,  the members of the Tea Party.  We saw them ignore, malign black  conservatives.  They ignore and malign conservative women.  They ignore and  malign gay conservatives.</p><p>And they bash good people in fly-over nation who are good enough to vote  for the Clintons for how many years?  But then, when they turn around and  they vote for Donald Trump, suddenly, Tucker, those people become bigots  and racists.</p><p>And we've watched media malign so many good Americans and seem to only  report one side of the story.</p><p>I mean, for instance, just look at everything that's happened with  Parkland.  Where is the media focusing on the Broward sheriff, for  instance, fighting the \"Miami Herald\" who has done epic work, they've done  amazing work in this story?</p><p>They've filed a lawsuit against the Broward Sheriff's Office trying to get  this video that the sheriff once promised that he was going to release.   Where is the focus on that?  </p><p>Or the political class that has let the mental crisis spiral out of  control?  Instead, honestly, Tucker, you know what they're writing about?   They're writing about my musical taste in \"Newsweek\" and focusing on my  appearance and me as a person and my husband and law-abiding gun owners  across the United States instead of doing their due diligence and acting  like the watchdog of the people.</p><p>So, who watches the watchers?  That's the question.</p><p>CARLSON:  If you're going to try and take people's guns away, don't you  think you have a moral obligation - and prevent them from protecting  themselves, don't you think you have an obligation to protect them better  than our elites are now doing?</p><p>LOESCH:  Yes.  That's what I don't understand.  Here we're looking at  multiple systemic failures coming from the government that failed to  protect us, all the while we have all of these individuals telling us,  well, you can trust the government to protect you.</p><p>Well, really?  They didn't with Sutherland Springs and they didn't with  Garland, Texas and they didn't with San Bernardino and they didn't with the  Navy Yard and they didn't in Charleston.  I could go on and on because  there were balls dropped in every single one of those instance, Tucker.  </p><p>And the political class has been largely silent.  They haven't been -</p><p>CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p>LOESCH:  They haven't been moved to make sure that the background check  system works, like Wayne LaPierre has called for 25 years to do.  And so, I  mean, this is where the focus - that's where - honestly, that's where the  focus should be in all of this.</p><p>CARLSON:  Of course.</p><p>LOESCH:  But to the point of people trying to say that somehow fact  checking media is violent, the progressive left has been violent for a very  long time.  And I can't take seriously the criticisms of people, Tucker,  who ignored the fires in Ferguson and they ignored Antifa violence and they  ignored so many other things and now they want to act like it's threatening  to fact check media.</p><p>CARLSON:  I'm just laughing because if you're asking sincere questions  about the people in charge, you're, obviously, working for Vladimir Putin.   So, good luck with your new Russian masters, Dana.</p><p>LOESCH:  I had Russian salad dressing earlier this week.  So, I guess, I'm  a spy or something.</p><p>CARLSON:  It's unbelievable.  Thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.</p><p>Facebook is moving forward with a new messaging app designed to get your  children hooked on social media and rearrange their brains completely.  Can  anything stop big tech?  We'll ask someone who is trying.  Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  15 years ago, Facebook didn't exist.  Today, it dominates our  lives, shapes our conversation, even to some extent determines the way we  think.  Americans spend close to an hour every single day on Facebook.  But  the company wants more.</p><p>Facebook is rolling out a new app messenger for kids.  It's aimed at  children as young as six.  More than 100 child developments experts have  warned this is a bad idea.  Could be a disaster.  It serves to addict kids  to social media earlier than ever.  </p><p>It has massive implications for our society.  The company seems to be  ignoring that.  Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense and wrote the book  \"Talking Back to Facebook\" and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Jim, thanks for coming on.  Have I mischaracterized what this app is  intended to do and who it's aimed at?</p><p>JIM STEYER, COMMON SENSE MEDIA CEO:  Nope.  I think you nailed it, Tucker.   I mean, really, this is about social media for the kindergarten set.  It's  basically getting hooked kids at younger and younger ages - 6, 7, 8 - on  social media platforms like Facebook and it's crazy.  We don't need it.   And that's why all the experts came out and suggested that.</p><p>CARLSON:  But we know that heavy social media use among young people leads  to social maladjustment, depression, maybe even more grave things.  I mean,  the implication is certainly that it can really hurt people, gravely hurt  them.</p><p>So, why would Facebook want to do this?</p><p>STEYER:  Because it's in their own economic best interest.  I mean,  truthfully, you're trying to hook people at younger and younger ages to the  brand and to the concept, and so it's an economic incentive.  But,  obviously, it's missing out on all the negative unintended consequences  that you just referred to.</p><p>I mean, this is just a no-brainer for a parent.  Why would you want your  six-year-old using Facebook or Instagram?  So, this is just - should be a  non-starter for parents.</p><p>CARLSON:  I mean, I'm sure R.J.  Reynolds would like to come out with a new  cigarette that's kindergarten friendly, but we say, no, you can't.  I mean,  adults can decide to do that if they want, but our society does not allow  cigar makers to sell to children.  Why are we allowing Facebook to do this  when we know it harms them?</p><p>STEYER:  Well, I think it's a very apt comparison.  And it's like candy- coated cigarettes.  So, you want to hook kids at younger and younger ages.</p><p>So, we actually at Common Sense think this is not a good idea at all.  And  it also brings up the broader issue of how do you get your kids - you're a  parent too, Tucker.  How do you get your kids away from the screen,  enjoying the incredible outdoors and world around them?  You just don't  want sitting on social media platforms in kindergarten or actually at any  age.</p><p>CARLSON:  Yes.  I mean, we know that it affects kids' ability to read and  retain information and to think clearly.  So, is there any legislative  effort to pull back?  Are we just passive in the face of a threat to our  children?</p><p>STEYER:  Actually, Tucker, there's a lot of good stuff coming on this kind  of issue.  There's stuff here on the West Coast in terms of looking at the  addiction research that needs to be done around social media platforms.  </p><p>You're seeing much greater privacy concern now.  You're seeing a number of  different legislative efforts to try to either encourage or require  companies to respect the young kids in their audience.  And that's going to  grow.</p><p>We passed a bill called the Eraser Button here in California couple of  years ago, so that kids who made dumb decisions could erase them.  So, I  think you're going to see a growing public outcry.  And I think your  covering it helps in that as well.</p><p>CARLSON:  I hope so.  I mean, I can just see them marketing Google Maps to  babies to learn how to crawl.  We're losing a lot in this.  And, Jim, thank  you for sounding the call about it.  Appreciate it.</p><p>STEYER:  Well, thank you for having us on, Tucker, and thanks for your  supporting it as well.  We like it.</p><p>CARLSON:  Always.  Well, we've got a major announcement about something  starting tomorrow on the show.  We'll tell you what it is coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON:  We hear a lot about female empowerment in this country and, of  course, we're totally for that.  We're for empowering all Americans.</p><p>But, for some reason, you almost never hear anything about how men are  doing in America.  So, we took a close look at the numbers.  And we found  them so shocking that we're devoting the month of March to a special series  on men in America.  Every Wednesday starting tomorrow, you'll be stunned by  the scope of the crisis.  We were.  It's a largely ignored disaster.  And  it is a disaster.  It affects every person in America.</p><p>Hope you'll be also heartened by some of the potential solutions we're  looking at.  We kick off tomorrow night with renowned psychologist and  thinker Jordan Peterson every Wednesday at 8:00.  I hope you'll joining us  starting tomorrow.  </p><p>Tune in every night to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying,  pomposity, smugness and groupthink.  Thanks for a great hour.  Good night  from Washington.  Sean Hannity right now.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, \"HANNITY\":  Lying, pomposity, smugness,  groupthink, I got it.  I totally got it.</p><p>CARLSON:  That's the spirit, Sean.</p><p>Hannity:  All right, Tucker.  Thank you.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Senior executives want to help direct the outcome as much as possible, and many also fear the impact of a patchwork of laws around the world.<br/>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told earlier this month that the influence of COs on important national policy issues, such as the best way to handle encryption, is not ideal in a democracy.<br/>\"This is the kind of thing that needs to come up with legislative solutions, versus individual CEOs of individual companies who have to find answers to what is a huge massive social challenge,\" he said.<br/>Mr. Nadella's comments came in reaction to a new dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over how the company handled a request to help unlock the iPhones of an apprentice Saudi Arabiapilot who allegedly fired and killed three people at a naval base in Florida.<br/>After the authorities tried and were unable to unlock the phones, Attorney General William Barr reiterated the government's demands that the company create a software solution, often called a backdoor, that allows police access to phones for cases of force majeure, such as those related to terrorism. Apple has said it has complied with data delivery requests, but has refused to create such an access point, warning that a backdoor could be exploited by malicious actors.<br/>Nadella and other executives have publicly supported Apple on the issue, even when they have suggested that legislative solutions are needed.<br/>Apple's chief executive Tim Cook called for a federal law to extend consumer rights to their data, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said global regulators should set clearer rules on integrity of elections, privacy and data portability. It has also supported federal privacy law.<br/>Aware of regulatory battlefields in the US, Europe and beyond, technology executives at presentations in Davos and across Europe last week emphasized the need to cooperate in regulation.<br/>\"I have no doubt that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a policy speech. \"The question is how to better address this.\"<br/>The growing power of big tech companies has attracted government scrutiny and action in several u.S. states, Europe and India, and President Trump and some Democratic presidential candidates have criticized the practices of Companies.<br/>Risks and betting have had a clearer view this year as California implements new historical policies. Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. spentabundantly lobbying over the past two years to shape one of the laws, which seeks to give consumers more control over the data companies collect over them.<br/>Companies succeeded in defeating some of the activists' more ambitious goals, such as giving consumers broader rights to sue businesses for their data practices.<br/>The efforts of tech giants in California indicate that their commitment to specific proposals, whether to oppose or soften them, may differ from their public calls for greater government regulation.<br/>Such promotion has a long history in many industries, including oil and insurance industries, where companies' public pleas for regulation were at odds with their other efforts to shape politics. Tech companies could also be motivated to adopt regulation in areas such as privacy and artificial intelligence to prevent potentially powerful antitrust initiatives. The most important evidence will come with how they respond to specific policy plans or support substantive legislation, according to analysts and former executives.<br/>Speaking in Rome last Tuesday, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said the industry needs rules to protect people online. Technology companies want to cooperate with the European Union and other governments on privacy and political communication, he said.<br/>\"We're just a platform is no longer an acceptable excuse,\" said Bret Taylor, Chief Operating Officer of Salesforce.com Inc., which sells software to help companies manage their customer relationships.<br/>\"We need to not only build technology but also consider how it is applied,\" the former Google and Facebook executive said in an interview in Davos.<br/>Last Wednesday in Davos, the executive director of International Business Machines Corp., Ginni Rometty, presented the IBM Policy Laboratory, which she says is an initiative to recommend new policies for some of the most thorny challenges of the Technology.<br/>\"The government can't do this alone in any way,\" he said. \"The first rule would be: regulate the use of technology, not technology itself.\"<br/>The new call of the tech giants to governments: please, rulers were first published in The Third.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10544030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y37-X001-DY1R-B53J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Read the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">latest updates in the coronavirus outbreak here</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Communist Party ousts provincial leader at the center of the outbreak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China\u2019s ruling Communist Party fired the leader of the province at the center of the new coronavirus outbreak on Thursday amid widespread public anger over the handling of the epidemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jiang Chaoliang, the party secretary of Hubei Province, is the highest-ranking official to lose his job over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,100 people in recent weeks.</p><p>Mr. Jiang will be replaced by Ying Yong, the mayor of Shanghai. The selection of Mr. Ying may underline the continued political control of Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader. Before being transferred to Shanghai in a fairly senior role in 2008, Mr. Ying had come up through the political ranks in Zhejiang Province, which is Mr. Xi\u2019s political base as well.</p><p>After the outbreak first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the leadership came under intense scrutiny for playing down the virus and delaying reports of its spread. The province then took drastic measures that included imposing a lockdown not only on Wuhan but also on tens of millions of people in surrounding areas.</p><p>For hospitals in Wuhan, already overwhelmed with patients, that cordon worsened a shortage of medical supplies that has continued.</p><p>A surge in new cases and deaths as diagnostic tools expand.</p><p>Early on Thursday, officials announced that nearly 15,000 new cases and 242 new deaths were recorded in a single day in Hubei Province, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, largely because the authorities there had expanded their diagnostic tools for counting new infections.</p><p>Until now, only infections confirmed by specialized testing kits were considered accurate. But those kits have been in such short supply \u2014 and so many sick people have gone untested \u2014 that the authorities in Hubei have started counting patients whose illness have been screened and identified by doctors.</p><p>The result was a sudden \u2014 and large \u2014 spike in the overall tally for the coronavirus: more than 1,300 people killed and well over 50,000 infected.</p><p>The change in how cases are counted is only one factor that has made it difficult for experts to determine the true scale of the epidemic. In fact, the shifting landscape of how infections are defined and confirmed has <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">led to significant variations</url> in the estimates for the extent of outbreak.</p><p>Japan says it will let some people off a quarantined cruise ship, as cases rise to 218.</p><p>As Japan announced 44 new coronavirus cases on a cruise ship quarantined in the waters off Yokohama, bringing the total to 218, the country\u2019s health minister said on Thursday that the authorities would begin allowing some passengers to disembark and serve out the remainder of the quarantine period on shore.</p><p>The minister, Katsunobo Kato, said that, if they first test negative for the virus, passengers 80 or older, those with existing medical conditions and those assigned to cabins without windows or balconies would be taken to facilities for confinement until the quarantine is scheduled to end on Feb. 19. Those who test positive will be taken to hospitals.</p><p>Of the newly confirmed cases, Mr. Kato said, 43 were passengers and one was a crew member. </p><p>The cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3, and passengers were expecting to go home the next day. But after learning that a man who got off the ship in Hong Kong had tested positive for the coronavirus, the Japanese government quarantined all 3,700 passengers and crew members on board. The quarantine period is scheduled to last for two weeks.</p><p>Separately, the Cambodian government said on Wednesday it would allow another cruise ship, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">the Westerdam</url>, to dock in Sihanoukville. The ship had been denied permission to stop in Japan, Guam, Taiwan and the Philippines, despite having no diagnoses of coronavirus.</p><p>\u2018All engagements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama remain indefinitely postponed.\u2019</p><p>The Dalai Lama has canceled his public events because of the coronavirus outbreak, his office says.</p><p>\u201cAs a precautionary measure, in view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, all engagements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama remain indefinitely postponed,\u201d a statement says.</p><p>On March 9, the Dalai Lama was scheduled to appear at a teaching event in Dharamsala, India.</p><p>No other events appear on the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">schedule</url>.</p><p>The Dalai Lama\u2019s office has also issued an appeal, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">urging Tibetans</url> across the world to \u201ccollectively pray for the speedy resolution to the crisis and the well-being of humanity.\u201d</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">coronavirus outbreak</url> has infected more than 45,000 people in Asia, according to statements from health officials. India, where the Dalai Lama lives, has at least three confirmed cases so far, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>A big tech show has been canceled.</p><p>One of the world\u2019s biggest technology trade shows was canceled on Wednesday as the coronavirus outbreak continued to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">disrupt the global business calendar</url>.</p><p>Every year since 2006, Mobile World Congress has drawn representatives of major tech companies to Barcelona to gather in giant conference halls to launch products, hobnob with industry luminaries and discuss deals and partnerships. The event typically draws more than 100,000 attendees from nearly 200 countries across the world. This year\u2019s event was scheduled to begin later this month.</p><p>But on Wednesday, the industry group that organizes the trade show, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">Global System for Mobile Communications Association</url>, said it was canceling the event because of \u201cthe coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances.\u201d</p><p>The cancellation of the show became inevitable when major companies including Nokia, Ericsson and Vodafone pulled out. The association had announced safety measures to try to keep the show on track, including not admitting people who had been to affected parts of China.</p><p>Last year, Mobile World Congress carried political significance when the U.S. government sent a delegation to warn wireless companies against using equipment sold by the Chinese tech giant Huawei.</p><p>Canceling the event is a blow to the city of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">Barcelona</url>, which has hosted the conference for years and enjoys a strong economic boost from the thousands of attendees putting their company expense accounts to work at restaurants, hotels and corporate events.</p><p>United Airlines extends its suspension of flights to mainland China.</p><p>United Airlines said Wednesday that it would not resume flights connecting the United States with mainland China and Hong Kong until April 24, extending an earlier suspension, after a similar announcement by American Airlines.</p><p>Demand for such flights declined sharply in late January as concern over the severity of the coronavirus outbreak began to take hold, according to data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation, an industry-owned transaction clearinghouse.</p><p>In the first few weeks of January, sales of tickets from the United States to mainland China were down slightly compared to the same weeks the year before, but by the fourth week of January, demand was down 59 percent year over year. Ticket refunds that week were up 534 percent, according to data based on 1.8 million tickets sold in January 2019 and 2020.</p><p>The C.D.C. says some coronavirus test kits are faulty.</p><p>Some of the coronavirus testing kits sent to states <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">have flaws and do not work properly,</url>the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.</p><p>The C.D.C. began sending the kits to states to allow them to conduct their own testing and get results faster than they would by shipping samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. The failure of the kits means that states still have to depend on the C.D.C., which will delay results by several days.</p><p>On trial runs in some states, the kits produced results that were \u201cinconclusive,\u201d Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news conference on Wednesday.</p><p>Dr. Messonnier told reporters that the kits had been sent to 30 other countries as well, but said later Wednesday that she was mistaken.</p><p>There have been 13 confirmed cases of the infection in patients in the United States so far.</p><p>For one Chinese traveler, paradise is more like purgatory.</p><p>What was supposed to be a short detour on her way to begin another semester of studies in Australia has turned into an anxious limbo for one Chinese student when that country joined others in banning travelers arriving from mainland China.</p><p>Now, Iris Yao must wait on Jeju Island, off the coast of South Korea. According to the current regulations, she cannot make her way to Australia until she has been out of China for at least 14 days. Alone in a foreign country and made to feel like a pariah has left Ms. Yao, 22, depressed and frustrated.</p><p>She is one of tens of thousands of Chinese travelers whose plans have been upset by rapidly changing regulations thrown up across the region<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">as the coronavirus has spread.</url></p><p>Ms. Yao arrived on the resort island last month for a short stay on her way back to her university in Sydney, Australia, from her hometown in Zhoushan, China. Since then, she has been virtually marooned on Jeju Island, known for its white sand beaches and volcanic landscape.</p><p>It might be slice of paradise, but she has not found it relaxing. Instead of the warm welcome once extended to wealthy Chinese tourists, the island\u2019s locals have met Ms. Yao and other Chinese visitors with worry, discrimination and fear.</p><p>Some restaurants on the resort island have banned Chinese citizens. Employees at one asked her not to speak Mandarin while eating there, fearing she would scare away customers.</p><p>\u201cThe fear toward the virus is everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair for all Chinese citizens; they are not allowed to go into restaurants or cannot speak Mandarin.\u201d</p><p>London has its first coronavirus case.</p><p>London is experiencing its first case of coronavirus, the British authorities said on Wednesday.</p><p>The patient, who is the United Kingdom\u2019s ninth case, contracted the virus in China and is being treated at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London.</p><p>Britain has confirmed nine cases of coronavirus infections, with five believed to be linked to a British businessman who may have contracted the virus in Singapore. The man, Steve Walsh, is believed to be the cause of five additional cases in France.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Walsh released a statement saying he has been released from the hospital and returned home, even as public health officials continue to try to trace the contacts of some of the people he is believed to have infected.</p><p>The strategic incident director of Britain\u2019s National Health Service, Prof. Keith Willett, said Mr. Walsh had developed only \u201cmild\u201d symptoms of the virus and had made a full recovery.</p><p>\u201cHe is no longer contagious and poses no risk to the public,\u201d Professor Willett said in a statement. \u201cHe is keen to return to his normal life and spend time with his family out of the media spotlight.\u201d</p><p>China directed local leaders to resume production.</p><p>The Chinese authorities have approved a broad strategy for trying to bring the coronavirus outbreak under control while restarting economic production, state news outlets reported Wednesday evening.</p><p>President Xi Jinping ordered that tax cuts be drafted and put into effect.</p><p>Premier Li Keqiang, the country\u2019s No. 2 official, and the country\u2019s cabinet called for major construction projects to begin across the country as soon as possible.</p><p>State-owned enterprises were told to cut rents. Banks were ordered to keep interest rates low.</p><p>City governments were told to make sure that workers who went home for the Lunar New Year holiday could reach their jobs.</p><p>The two most powerful political bodies in China \u2014 the Standing Committee of the Communist Party Politburo and the government\u2019s cabinet of ministers \u2014 each issued similar orders. Both groups produced hints of the fairly broad stimulus program that many economists expect soon.</p><p>None of the announcements directly addressed the difficult balancing act that China now faces: how to put more than 700 million workers back on the job without creating conditions that could allow the virus to spread.</p><p>.</p><p>With classes suspended, educators in China scramble to keep students engaged.</p><p>The Ministry of Education in China instructed schools on Wednesday to find ways to keep the country\u2019s 190 million primary and secondary students busy during the suspension of the school year, but it discouraged any significant efforts to provide classes online.</p><p>In a notice posted on its website, the ministry urged provincial school administrators to draw up detailed study plans for students who, like everyone else, are largely confined to their homes.</p><p>The ministry encouraged reading and physical exercises and, if possible, online tutoring, though it also warned that primary-school students especially should not spend too much time online. It also announced that special programing on China\u2019s national education television channel, CETV 4, would begin next week; the network had a similar role during the SARS epidemic in 2003.</p><p>The coronavirus epidemic that began in Wuhan has now thrown the country\u2019s schools and universities into chaos. Some provinces, including Liaoning and Sichuan, plan to reopen primary and secondary schools on Feb. 17, at least for now, while others have already postponed the school year until at least March, including Shanghai, Zhejiang and Guangdong.</p><p>The delays could have the greatest impact on those students preparing for the major national exams for high school and college held at the end of spring.</p><p>The State Department is allowing some employees to leave Hong Kong.</p><p>The United States will allow nonemergency consulate employees in Hong Kong and their families to leave because of the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Wednesday.</p><p>The decision to allow voluntary departures was made in response to continuing uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and practical considerations such as school closings, the official said.</p><p>The consulate in Hong Kong will remain open and continue to provide regular services.</p><p>A similar decision was made to allow nonemergency State Department personnel and their families <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">to leave mainland China in late January.</url></p><p>The State Department chartered flights and evacuated about 850 people from Wuhan, where the outbreak began late last year, including employees of the United States Consulate in the city.</p><p>Hong Kong has 50 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death. The State Department\u2019s travel advisory for the city is at Level 2, the second-lowest of four levels, and recommends that visitors to Hong Kong \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d because of the outbreak.</p><p>This month, the warning for mainland China was raised to 4, the highest level.</p><p>\u201cDo not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus,\u201d it said.</p><p>Disrupted supply chains are sending a ripple effect across the globe.</p><p>The coronavirus outbreak in China has generated economic waves that are rocking commodities markets and disrupting the supply networks that act as the backbone of the global economy.</p><p>In Australia, after hauling hundreds of thousands of tons of iron ore to China, returning freighters can face a 14-day quarantine.</p><p>One of the world\u2019s largest copper mining companies, BHP, has been in talks to possibly delay shipments to Chinese ports.</p><p>And China is turning back deliveries of liquefied natural gas, potentially disrupting shipments from Qatar to Indonesia.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a rippling out,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see it stopping.\u201d</p><p>Prices for key industrial raw materials such as copper, iron ore, nickel, aluminum and liquid natural gas have plummeted since the virus emerged.</p><p>And manufacturers, mining companies and commodity producers of all stripes are weighing whether they will be forced to cut back on production for fear of adding to a growing inventory glut.</p><p>Airbnb cancels bookings in Beijing.</p><p>Airbnb will suspend bookings in Beijing until May 1, the company said on Wednesday.</p><p>The decision was made \u201cin accordance with guidance issued by the government to all companies in the short-term rental industry,\u201d a spokesman for the company said. He added that existing reservations would be refunded.</p><p>Airbnb has also <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-news.html\">waived cancellation fees</url> for travel to and from mainland China until the end of February. Travelers who had booked stays in Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, can cancel reservations without charge until April 1.</p><p>The company had continued to accept reservations throughout China during the busy travel season before and after the Lunar New Year holiday, even as the government started to lock down cities and impose road restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.</p><p>The company also said it would set aside $10 million \u201cto support hosts in the next few years, during the recovery period of the local tourism industry.\u201d</p><p>Reporting and research was contributed by Amber Wang, Zoe Mou, Albee Zhang, Yiwei Wang, Claire Fu, Amy Qin, Sui-Lee Wee, Steven Lee Myers, Keith Bradsher, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Matt Phillips, Austin Ramzy, Tiffany May, Elian Peltier, Yonette Joseph, Megan Specia, Heather Murphy, Iliana Magra, Niraj Chokshi and Ceylan Yeginsu.</p><p>PHOTO: Lab workers testing samples for the coronavirus in Wuhan.

It is also the first piece of work to explore these ethical questions in depth and propose actions to ensure they deliver on their potential.<br/><br/>Neural interfaces are devices that offer a new frontier for treating conditions like dementia, paralysis, mental health conditions or obesity. While recent announcements from 'Big Tech' firms and entrepreneurs have shown their potential to change how we communicate, and interact with technology.<br/><br/>As a result, the report's expert steering group says ministers should act swiftly to understand the ethical risks and ensure regulations are fit to make the UK a global leader in the field.<br/><br/>Dr Andrew Sims, Honorary Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University's Faculty of Medical Sciences, and Head of Department of Northern Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering at Newcastle Hospitals, was part of the steering group.<br/><br/>He said: 'In Newcastle, academics in neuroscience and NHS scientists work together in developing new neural technologies, and have contributed their experience and foresight to the Royal Society's report.<br/><br/>'This not only recognises the region's strengths in translating basic research into benefit for patients, but also its reputation for engaging patients and public in shaping national debates associated with ground-breaking innovations.'<br/><br/>The UK has a proven track record in promoting rapid and responsible implementation of innovative new technologies, such as mitochondrial replacement therapy, pioneered at Newcastle University, and pre-implantation genetic testing.<br/><br/>Combined with the NHS, a dynamic life sciences sector and thriving creative industries - in particular gaming - the UK is perfectly positioned to identify and implement new applications for neural interfaces.<br/><br/>The Royal Society is proposing the Government use this emerging field as a test case for a new regulatory approach, which could accelerate development of innovative technology in the future.<br/><br/>Dr Tim Constandinou, Director of the Next Generation Neural Interfaces (NGNI) Lab, Imperial College London and co-chair of the report, said: 'By 2040 neural interfaces are likely to be an established option to enable people to walk after paralysis and tackle treatment-resistant depression, they may even have made treating Alzheimer's disease a reality.<br/><br/>'While advances like seamless brain-to-computer communication seem a much more distant possibility, we should act now to ensure our ethical and regulatory safeguards are flexible enough for any future development.<br/><br/>'In this way we can guarantee these emerging technologies are implemented safely and for the benefit of humanity.'<br/><br/>Harnessing the possibilities from neural interfaces<br/><br/>The Royal Society is recommending:<br/><br/>A 'national investigation' of the ethical issues presented by neural interfaces, to address questions of what data should be collected, how it is kept safe, and the acceptability of enhancements.<br/><br/>Ministers work with industry and universities to create a UK Neural Interface Ecosystemwhich encourages innovation and collaboration in this field.<br/><br/>Government and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) should trial new ways of encouraging innovation to prevent a monopoly by 'Big Tech' firms. This could include a 'sandbox' approach for new medical devices to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in a controlled environment.<br/><br/>Giving the public a clear voicein shaping how this technology is used and regulated for the public good and opting citizens out of having their neural data shared as a default.<br/><br/>A public dialogue exercise led by the Royal Society found strong support for neural interfaces in situations where they enable patients to recover something that has been lost due to injury or a medical condition; but less support for the technology when it is used to enhance functions such as memory, concentration or physical skills among healthy people.<br/><br/>Looking ahead<br/><br/>External and internal neural interfaces are already being used in medical conditions from stroke rehabilitation to epilepsy and commercial products promising better appetite control, or improved sleep and focus are already a reality.<br/><br/>There are no internally-implanted interfaces licensed outside of medicine, but this may only be a matter of time.<br/><br/>In July, tech mogul Elon Musk announced that as early as 2020 his company, Neuralink, could apply to start human trials in the US using ultrafine electrodes inserted in the brain to allow people with locked-in syndrome or paralysis to control a computer or phone.<br/><br/>While Facebook-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has expressed interest in 'telepathic typing' and the company is supporting research that aims to create an external headset able to transcribe a vocabulary of 1,000 words, at a rate of 100-words per minute, just by thinking.<br/><br/>The Royal Society expert working group says there is a possibility that, in future, 'people could become telepathic to some degree' as more sophisticated neural interfaces emerge.<br/><br/>However, the most advanced attempts to send thoughts to date are at the level of AI recognising simple brain patterns which correspond to pre-trained words or answers.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-28K1-F0K1-N43C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is time for a new approach to dealing with this problem and that is precisely what The New Center is offering.\" An astounding half of all calls in the U.S. are expected to be robocall spam in 2019.\u00a0The New Center has investigated the scale and causes of America's robocall epidemic and concluded that the current system for regulating robocalls just doesn't work. It's a system that relies on understaffed agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to police an impossible number of illegal calls, creating an endless game of whack-a-mole that American consumers will lose every time. \"It is time to fundamentally change the game. Telecom companies can and should step up to play a much greater role in solving the robocall problem, either voluntarily or with fines to drive their behavior,\" said Galston. \"Telecom companies already have the technology to do it. Now, they just need the will.\" In November of last year, The New Center released a comprehensive policy paper on the influence of large tech companies on public discourse and American privacy. The robocall paper is an extension of this work, exploring yet another way in which unregulated and increasingly sophisticated technologies threaten the privacy and well-being of Americans. \"Robocalls: Big Telecom's Big Problem\" is available for download from newcenter.org. Newcenter.org is the home of all original content from The New Center, as well as curated stories highlighting bipartisan political efforts, original analysis of where the left and right overstep their bounds, and relevant and exclusive polling. Here is a brief summary of the policy solutions offered in the Robocall paper. A Dime for Every Robocall Telecom companies that refuse to police robocalls should pay a price. Congress and the FTC should work together to evaluate telecom carriers' robocall-blocking performance, and they should punish those that flounder. Fortunately, this evaluation infrastructure already exists. The FTC website's telemarketing complaint form asks several questions to assess whether reported calls are illegal, such as the time of the call, the amount of money requested, and the caller's company information. To punish carriers, the FTC should simply request the name of the carrier on the device that was illegally called. It can then fine carriers - a dime per call - for each illegal call reported on their networks. Considering there were 48 billion illegal robocalls in 2018, carriers could face as much as $4.8 billion in fines if they fail to step up to the plate. Although carriers should be incentivized through fines, the responsibility is not theirs alone. Government agencies must be tougher in cracking down on those responsible for illegal robocalls. Tougher Enforcement. Tougher Penalties. And Criminal Prosecutions American telecoms - with a push from Congress and the FTC - need to take the lead in policing robocalls. But government enforcement of robocallers that slip through the cracks can and should be a lot tougher.

While it's unknown exactly how much money Abramovich swindled from the victims of his vacation scams, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai did report that the ruse disrupted the operations of an emergency medical paging provider. By slowing down the network, Pai stated, Abramovich could have delayed vital emergency medical care.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The FTC should collect fines more swiftly.\u00a0From 2013 to 2015, the FCC announced approximately $235 million in fines to communications firms \u2014 but as of November 2015, had collected $0. As of 2018, in fact, the FTC has only collected $121 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the total fines levied. Slow and limited fine collection lets offenders off the hook and encourages others to try their hand at the illegal telemarketing trade.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The FTC should consider implementing criminal penalties on top of civil ones, as Connecticut did in 2018.

On the other, Internet service providers want to hold down their costs while keeping up with Americans' ever-increasing demand for digital content. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These goals may be mutually exclusive, and it isn't yet clear which side will emerge victorious.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission faced a big setback on this front in January, when a court struck down its \"Open Internet\" rules. The FCC had barred ISPs from blocking or \"unreasonably discriminating\" against Web content, but Verizon successfully challenged the regulations on the grounds that the so-called \"net neutrality\" rules had overstepped the commission's legal authority. </p><p>The FCC now faces the challenge of crafting new net neutrality regulations that will withstand legal scrutiny. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said last week that the agency plans to do just that.</p><p>\"Wheeler has stood up and walked through town like the sheriff and said, 'Okay, the rules are still on,'\" said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who coined the term \"net neutrality.\" </p><p>\"Whether he's shooting blanks or bullets isn't clear yet, but he's on the beat.\"</p><p>The FCC is currently collecting public comments before issuing its new set of regulations. Wheeler said those rules would prohibit ISPs from blocking websites, force them to disclose how they manage traffic and prevent them from favoring some kinds of traffic over others -- for example, loading Amazon faster than eBay. The agency also wants to enhance competition among ISPs by reversing restrictions on broadband services from local governments.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Comcast have committed to abiding by the 2010 rules despite the January ruling that overturned them. Yet at the same time, they've instituted policies that some argue are against the spirit of net neutrality.</p><p>Comcast and Netflix announced an agreement Sunday in which the online video company will boost streaming speeds by paying for direct access to Comcast's broadband network, instead of delivering traffic through third parties as it's done previously. </p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs. </p><p>The FCC's pending rules won't address these kinds of deals, which could nonetheless affect the kinds of content consumers can access. </p><p>Given the massive amount of data consumption Netflix generates -- around a third of traffic on big ISPs during peak hours -- some analysts say it makes sense for the company to pay up. If ISPs have the option of charging content distributors, that could allow them to bring down costs for consumers and reinvest in infrastructure.</p><p>\"Right now, I think most people are using the Internet without too many problems,\" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \"The question becomes whether this is a solution looking for a problem.\"</p><p>But consumer advocates worry that such direct-access agreements favor deep-pocketed content companies over small ones. They have also expressed concern that the FCC's planned rules won't cover the mobile Web, which is much more lightly regulated.</p><p>Last month, AT&amp;T announced a \"sponsored data\" plan for mobile customers in which content from paying businesses won't count against monthly data caps, creating concerns about traffic discrimination. Verizon and AT&amp;T have also previously blocked use of the Google Wallet app, which competes with their own offerings. </p><p>Though FCC doesn't have a great track record on net neutrality -- its two previous attempts at regulation having been invalidated by court rulings -- the agency does have a \"nuclear option.\" The FCC could move ISPs into the same legal category as phone companies, which are treated more like utilities and face stricter regulations. The FCC hasn't taken the reclassification option off the table, but isn't pursuing it for the moment. The move would surely meet resistance from the industry's well-funded lobbyists, of which Wheeler was previously one. </p><p>Meanwhile, the biggest broadband providers could get even bigger: Comcast recently announced plans to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, potentially creating a combined company that would bring cable or Internet service to about 30% of American subscribers.</p><p>\"When it comes to high-speed Internet access, you have a few massive players with unconstrained market power, and as a country, we're risking our future by not treating Internet access like a utility,\" said Susan Crawford, a professor at Cardozo Law School. \"Instead we're serving the shareholders of the cable companies.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

On the other, Internet service providers want to hold down their costs while keeping up with Americans' ever-increasing demand for digital content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These goals may be mutually exclusive, and it isn't yet clear which side will emerge victorious.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission faced a big setback on this front in January, when a court struck down its \"Open Internet\" rules. The FCC had barred ISPs from blocking or \"unreasonably discriminating\" against Web content, but Verizon successfully challenged the regulations on the grounds that the so-called \"net neutrality\" rules had overstepped the commission's legal authority.</p><p>The FCC now faces the challenge of crafting new net neutrality regulations that will withstand legal scrutiny. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said last week that the agency plans to do just that.</p><p>\"Wheeler has stood up and walked through town like the sheriff and said, 'Okay, the rules are still on,'\" said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who coined the term \"net neutrality.\"</p><p>\"Whether he's shooting blanks or bullets isn't clear yet, but he's on the beat.\"</p><p/><p>The FCC is currently collecting public comments before issuing its new set of regulations. Wheeler said those rules would prohibit ISPs from blocking websites, force them to disclose how they manage traffic and prevent them from favoring some kinds of traffic over others -- for example, loading Amazon faster than eBay. The agency also wants to enhance competition among ISPs by reversing restrictions on broadband services from local governments.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Comcast have committed to abiding by the 2010 rules despite the January ruling that overturned them. Yet at the same time, they've instituted policies that some argue are against the spirit of net neutrality.</p><p>Comcast and Netflix announced an agreement Sunday in which the online video company will boost streaming speeds by paying for direct access to Comcast's broadband network, instead of delivering traffic through third parties as it's done previously.</p><p>Related: Customers react to Comcast-TWC deal</p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.</p><p>The FCC's pending rules won't address these kinds of deals, which could nonetheless affect the kinds of content consumers can access.</p><p>Given the massive amount of data consumption Netflix generates -- around a third of traffic on big ISPs during peak hours -- some analysts say it makes sense for the company to pay up. If ISPs have the option of charging content distributors, that could allow them to bring down costs for consumers and reinvest in infrastructure.</p><p>\"Right now, I think most people are using the Internet without too many problems,\" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. \"The question becomes whether this is a solution looking for a problem.\"</p><p>But consumer advocates worry that such direct-access agreements favor deep-pocketed content companies over small ones. They have also expressed concern that the FCC's planned rules won't cover the mobile Web, which is much more lightly regulated.</p><p>Last month, AT&amp;T announced a \"sponsored data\" plan for mobile customers in which content from paying businesses won't count against monthly data caps, creating concerns about traffic discrimination. Verizon and AT&amp;T have also previously blocked use of the Google Wallet app, which competes with their own offerings.</p><p>Though FCC doesn't have a great track record on net neutrality -- its two previous attempts at regulation having been invalidated by court rulings -- the agency does have a \"nuclear option.\" The FCC could move ISPs into the same legal category as phone companies, which are treated more like utilities and face stricter regulations. The FCC hasn't taken the reclassification option off the table, but isn't pursuing it for the moment. The move would surely meet resistance from the industry's well-funded lobbyists, of which Wheeler was previously one.</p><p>Meanwhile, the biggest broadband providers could get even bigger: Comcast recently announced plans to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, potentially creating a combined company that would bring cable or Internet service to about 30% of American subscribers.</p><p>\"When it comes to high-speed Internet access, you have a few massive players with unconstrained market power, and as a country, we're risking our future by not treating Internet access like a utility,\" said Susan Crawford, a professor at Cardozo Law School. \"Instead we're serving the shareholders of the cable companies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20140225open-internet1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BMD-4V11-DY60-K244-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>10:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 25, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Below is an excerpt with a link to the full Update.____________________ On March 5, 2019, the Government of Canada announced that Matthew Boswell would serve as Canada's new Commissioner of Competition (Commissioner) for a five-year term. Shortly after his appointment, the new Commissioner outlined his policy and enforcement priorities in a speech at the Canadian Bar Association's Competition Law Spring Conference (seeCommissioner of Competition, Speech, No River too Wide, No Mountain too High: Enforcing and Promoting Competition in the Digital Age[1](May 7, 2019)). Many of the new Commissioner's stated priorities for the Competition Bureau (Bureau) are focused on the digital economy. </p><p>The Commissioner's initial digital economy related comments in his May 7th speech, including enhanced enforcement, have now been amplified in subsequent announcements and proceedings (see, for example,CBC News, New tools, stiffer penalties needed to police big tech companies, says competition watchdog (May 31, 2019)[2]andOECD Conference on Competition and the Digital Economy (June 3, 2019)[3]). The Bureau also hosted a Data Forum in Ottawa on May 20th, which included discussions by Canadian and international experts on a range of digital economy related issues, including digital platforms, privacy and competition, data portability and interoperability and the regulatory and enforcement landscape. The Bureau's increased emphasis on competition and the digital economy tie in to current Federal Government related policies, notably its recently releasedDigital Charter[4], which includes several competition related principles (for example, stronger enforcement, ensuring a level playing field including fair competition and transparency, portability and interoperability to give Canadians more control over their data). The Bureau's new digital economy policy goals also come at the same time as US antitrust agencies are reported to be commencing investigations of Google, Facebook and Amazon and a parallel House Judiciary Committee inquiry has been launched into whether tech companies are using their market power to harm competition.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report, A Whole New World: How technology is driving the evolution of intelligent banking in North America, conducted on behalf of Temenos, reveals changing customer behavior and demands as one of the biggest trends that will impact retail banking in North America.</p><p>The study also found that banking clients increasingly seek speed and convenience, and with Google the latest tech giant to announce plans for \"smart\" checking accounts linked to the Google Pay app, new technologies are understandably seen as high impact trends on the sector for both the short (40% for 2020) and medium terms (43% for 2025).</p><p>In addition, the study shows challenger banks are increasingly making their presence felt in North America, be they domestic start-ups such as Chime or Simple (now part of BBVA), or overseas brands such as Monzo and Revolut expanding their footprint.</p><p>However, the study reveals that payment players, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, Visa, and Square, are seen as a far greater immediate competitive challenge (cited by 41% of respondents for 2020), than the neo-banks (16% for 2020). Banks are also conscious of the upcoming threat posed by big tech firms teaming up with fintechs to create hybrids (29% for 2025), where the app provider has no need for a banking license and is not required to comply with regulatory capital ratios.</p><p>Thomas E. Hogan, President of Temenos North America, said:</p><p>* \"Banks and credit unions are under enormous pressure to transform and disrupt.  This is not new news and has been in flight for the past several years.  The key insight today is to swiftly shift from the legacy focus on survival and efficiency to a focus on growth and leadership.  There is an immediate opportunity to leverage technology for growth in clients, assets, lending, loyalty, and human capital.  It is equally important that financial institutions pursue these outcomes in parallel with the enablement of open banking.\"</p><p>Other Key Findings</p><p>* North American banks are focusing their actions on becoming digital eco-systems, offering bank-related and non-financial services from third parties (44%), with only few attempting to build niche propositions (16%) or opting to become a third-party aggregator (12%)</p><p>* The primary need for North American banks is to be far more agile (38% for 2020) and able to bring new features and products to market, but that is complicated when regulatory requirements*   have not been set</p><p>* With a plurality of North American banks planning an open banking strategy (37% for 2025), the need for greater regulatory clarity will only become more pressing</p><p>* Although tech firms may be more than capable of launching new services that fully replicate the banking experience, they appear to be holding back.

Good morning again, Dagen.</p><p>That $1 trillion package from Senate Republicans includes more stimulus checks $1,200 dollar direct payments to many Americans, along with a proposal to reduce unemployment benefits to 70 percent of income. The relief bill not expected to extended the $600 dollar enhanced unemployment benefits which is expiring July 31.</p><p>This also would exclude a payroll tax cut, something President Trump wanted but Democrats and some Republicans have opposed.</p><p>Unrest in America.

This was the first hurricane for the 2020 Atlantic season. National Weather Service says the system unloaded more than 12 inches of rain in some parts of Texas.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas took a swipe at Hawaii, coming within a very thin distance of a direct hit there. But that hasn't stopped heavy rain and winds from battering part of Maui. President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the state.</p><p>And those are all your headlines this morning, Dagen. Back over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>Republican lawmakers set to unveil their next coronavirus stimulus plan today, later today. The proposal expected to cost about $1 trillion. It would include liability protection for businesses, another $1,200 in payments to Americans, money for additional testing, as well as $100 billion going to schools and universities.</p><p>Joining us now, Pennsylvania congressman, member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Judiciary Committee, Guy Reschenthaler.</p><p>Congressman, great to see you.</p><p>But what about that $600 extra that people are receiving every week in jobless benefits? That is the sticking point. Are you going to leave Americans without any extra money?</p><p>REP. GUY RESCHENTHALER (R-PA): Dagen, first off, thanks for having me on. I appreciate it.</p><p>Let's just talk about that extra $600 a week in payments. That's really a drag on the economy, because what it is doing is it's incentivizing people not to go back to work. And those that are going back to work, employers are finding themselves having to pay well over fair market wages to incentivize folks to come back to work. So that is dragging the economy down.</p><p>The plan that's going to be unveiled today is going to provide 70 percent of what somebody would make if they were going back to work. So if the individual wants that extra 30 percent, they're going to have to go back to work. So I'm supportive of that. And of course, there is direct stimulus payments to individuals, that is outside of the unemployment compensation.</p><p>So I think it's a good starting point. We also have money going to schools, and individuals, parents who have choice to take a voucher and be able to send their children -- their kids to schools that are open, which will incentivize schools to open and open safely.</p><p>So I think it's a good starting point. It's $1 trillion. The far left social justice Democrats want to have $4 trillion dollars in spending. So let's see where this goes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, respectfully, the Republicans, you guys and gals, waited so long, though, that this $600 per week, even if it's cut to 70 percent of what you would be making on the job -- you waited so long, that these benefits are probably going to disappear for literally millions of Americans. The Democrats will tell you that they passed a 3.5 -- this is in the House -- a $3.5 trillion bill, additional stimulus that passed in the House in May. What took you so long?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, I would say that bill that the Democrats passed in May, that was passed pretty much along party lines, was nothing more than a messaging bill. It was crammed with a bunch of far left radical ideas. It was a way for the Democrats to take advantage of this situation, this pandemic, and cram in their Green New Deal provisions, their really far left socialists ideals were crammed into that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't say that you should take -- I didn't say that the Republicans should take it up and get behind it.</p><p>But again, you knew that these - this $600 per week was expiring at the end of this month. Those benefits disappeared over the weekend in many states. So where were you in June and most of July?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, we were trying to get the Democrats to come to a reasonable position, but Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House, not Kevin McCarthy. If Kevin McCarthy were speaker, we would have had something reasonable.</p><p>But -- call me an old school Republican, Dagen, but I still think the best way that you get the economy back on track is reducing taxation, reducing regulation. That reduces the burden on businesses, and it incentivizes business to grow, hire more people, and get back on track.</p><p>You can't get this economy back by not having tax cuts and by throwing regulation -- more regulation on business. That is why the Republican plan, which provides for liability protections, is a good starting place. I would like to see payroll tax cuts or holidays. I would like to see reduction in corporate income tax, in personal income tax as well. But unfortunately, we've got to negotiate with these far left Democrats that control the House of Representatives.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not getting behind trillions of dollars in additional spending, and I fully acknowledge that roughly - well more than two-thirds, based on University of Chicago research -- more than two-thirds of individuals who were collecting unemployment benefits are receiving more in unemployment than they received on the job. I acknowledge that.</p><p>But -- but again, where were the Republicans in the Senate that really needed to craft something, in order to provide some certainty for the American individual? Families who can't go back to work, because their economy is still potentially shut down in some way because of this virus.</p><p>Maria -- speaking of the Senate, Maria Bartiromo talked to Senator Lindsey Graham on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" who had this to say about support for COVID-19 relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: So are we going to see you pass something before the Senate leaves on August 8th? What is the conversation now about those unemployment benefits which will go away on July 31?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any phase four package, that's just a fact. And a lot of Democrats are going to insist on $3 trillion, which would be way too much. It would be wasted money.</p><p>I'm confident President Trump will lead us to a solution where we have money for kids, jobs, and healthcare. We need to stimulate the economy. We need a phase four, and I think we will come together before August the 5th to get this done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, reaction to that?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, I think Lindsey Graham is right. But a lot of people are hesitant to vote for another $4 trillion -- for $4 trillion more, because at the end of the day, this debt that we are carrying, it is a tax on future generations. It is also going to inhibit growth moving forward.</p><p>So before we spend $4 trillion, let's see if we can get away with spending $1 trillion. But let's also make sure that schools are safely reopening, so when the jobs come back open, parents feel comfortable leaving. They won't have to stay home with their kids. Let's make sure that we get some kind of voucher system in place. And let's also make sure that we have liability protections, so that these businesses are not facing lawsuits for reopening.</p><p>So there is a lot going on right now. It is complex. But at the end of the day, we've got to incentivize that -- we've got to incentivize businesses to reopen. And again, I'd push for tax cuts and at least a break on the payroll tax cut. Unfortunately -- payroll taxes -- unfortunately, that has been taken off the table already.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has been.</p><p>Congressman good to see you. Guy Reschenthaler, thanks for being here this Monday.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Thank you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up China Beige Book CEO Leland Miller weighing in on the rising tensions with China as the U.S. consulate in Chengdu officially closes.</p><p>And keeping safe this summer. The new warning over the chemicals found in sunscreen -- sunscreen.</p><p>Plus treat your heart, treat your heart. The new study that shows how eating chocolate can lower your risk of heart disease.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Futures are pointing to gains this morning. Triple-digit gain on the Dow futures, 120 points to -- 24 points to the plus side on the Dow. This ahead of a big earnings week and economic data. One dozen Dow components will report this week. Some of the major companies: Pfizer, Mickey D's, Boeing, Apple, Exxon.</p><p>Joining me now, Wells Fargo senior global market strategist Scott Wren.</p><p>Scott, what are you watching this week? Is it earnings? Is it what these companies are saying about investment, hiring the road ahead?</p><p>SCOTT WREN, WELLS FARGO SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: Well, Dagen, I think, you know, earnings season remember actual range (ph) results are what happened in the past. So we want to try to look forward. Normally you get some guidance out of these but as we know. A lot of the S&amp;P 500 companies have pulled guidance and really for the most part, the other ones that are giving you a little guidance are being very conservative.</p><p>So I'm not so sure that we're getting a lot of valuable information from the guidance either. So earnings, you know, it is -- it is meaningful as always but hey we know it's going to be bad news. The market's expecting 40, 45 percent down. It's a little bit better than that right now.</p><p>But I'm not expecting a whole heck of a lot of -- guidance out of what we're seeing here. Really this week, there is a couple of things. I mean I'm interested to see what GDP is going to be really, and you know, the orders for durable goods. You know, that's always a good gauge of business capital spending. We're not expecting a whole lot of that but it would be nice to have a little bit.</p><p>But I think that GDP number is really going to grab the attention, the expectations are so wide out there we are looking for minus 29 percent. I think that is a little bit better than the consensus but, you know, you're seeing anything from, you know, minus 20 to minus 45 out there for the range.</p><p>So there is a lot going on this week, and I think the markets probably going to be a little bit volatile. But all in all, you know, this virus news is the most important as we look ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John Lonski, jump in here.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, let's get to the point. Do you think the market right now is grossly overvalued, fairly valued? Would you buy or hold?</p><p>WREN: Well, you know, John, for us for right here 32.50 is our year-end target S&amp;P 500. So it's pretty fair value for us. Maybe a little bit ahead of itself, as we look out through year-end 2021. We've got a 3,500 number out there. So, for us, you know we want to be in this. We think we are going to have some opportunities to buy at lower levels because really if you look at retail investors in general they have a lot of cash.</p><p>They have missed a lot really in the last 10 years. And they've certainly missed a lot of this big bounce that we've had off the March 23rd low. So that's what we're trying to encourage our clients to do on big down weeks and big down days. You need to have a plan. You need to step in. You need to look at tech, consumer discretionary, communications services, health care -- those types of sectors. And I think those are the ones that likely to carry us forward as we recover in 2021.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love gold, the smell of it, the taste of it.</p><p>That is \"Goldmember\", by the way. I don't love gold but clearly people do, Scott. It's hitting their all-time high, record high near $2,000 an ounce. What do you -- what is your take?</p><p>WREN: Well I can tell you that our commodities guys have been on this thing and they've been right. And you know, I'm not a gold expert at all but this is a touch above where we thought it was going to finish the year. But if we look out through 2021 -- and that is what we're trying to give our clients, a longer view rather than what is happening over the next six months because anything can happen really.</p><p>But over the next year and a half, our commodities group is looking for $2,200 to $2,300 in gold. So they're bullish on it. I think it's probably jumped a little bit quicker than what we expected but the pricing in here is not a surprise overall but you know, let's face it. The overnight move, you get a big move like this in one day, doesn't happen often in gold. But clearly this is a momentum story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scott, great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>WREN: Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scott Wren, take care.</p><p>Coming up unrest in America, Portland chaos stretches into day 60. We look -- that is coming up ahead.</p><p>Plus fleeing a high-tax blue state.

Their lawyer telling Fox News the Bellmawr police blocked the Atilis Gym parking lot this morning. Ian Smith and Frank Trombetti (ph) were arrested a short time later. They join \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" on Saturday after a judge ruled that the state can close their gym. Their lawyers say they're expected to get a complaint and be released this morning.</p><p>We've reached out the Bellmawr police for comment.</p><p>Now, unrest in Seattle. Officers blocking protesters from a police precinct. The demonstrations were mainly peaceful, much different scene than one day before.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(EXPLETIVE DELETED) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Seattle police releasing body camera video of Saturday's riots. Police say they were hit by rocks, water bottles, explosives. 59 officers injured; 47 people were arrested.</p><p>Lee, I think that we have to stop calling these protests. These are an anarchic -- they're riots by anarchists. These are criminals. And why more people aren't being arrested I have no idea.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKI AND PARTNERS: You know, I think it's a really important distinction because police officials in both Portland and Seattle made that same distinction. They said these are not protests. These are riots. They classify them as riots and I think it's important to understand that shift.</p><p>Because when you oppose -- protest that's one thing. When you're opposing riots it's a very different thing. And I think the language is very important that it's used properly here. And this is a really, really bad state of affairs. This isn't about, you know, left versus right or about being political. This is really about the truth of what we're seeing there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But these mayors and they are Democratic-run cities,. Mitch, that they are again, if they're anti-Trump they seem to get a pass from people on the left.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS: Yes. but the images aren't necessarily the same when you go from newspaper to newspaper or cable news network to cable news network. And I think Lee is absolutely right. I said they are what they are and they are riots and they are violent and there are bad people here.</p><p>And I think the electorate really needs to know the truth about what is going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why aren't these companies, these large corporations that are based in say a Seattle like a Starbucks, a Microsoft outside of Seattle. Amazon -- why aren't these CEOs and leaders there getting on the horn and call and say put a stop to this. We're not going to sit by and watch businesses being destroyed and a local economy being decimated. And watch people get injured in the streets.</p><p>Where are you? Why don't they do that? Oh that is right they don't want to get in the middle of politics.</p><p>Coming up China Beige Book CEO Leland Miller here to talk about the growing threat of China. What we're doing about it. The U.S. consulate in Chengdu being closed.</p><p>Plus futures are pointing to gains at the open.</p><p>June durable goods orders out in just moments.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 27th. We're waiting on June durable goods orders. Economists expecting a 7.2 percent gain from May. We have the numbers as soon as they hit the tape. 114-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. Ex- transportation, we're also expecting to see a gain. Cheryl, take it away.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Let's go through these numbers. First are the durable goods number month-over-month. The expectation was a gain of 7.2 percent. Slight beat here, 7.3 percent. This nowhere near the previous number that we'd gotten that was 15.7 percent. That was really about pent up demand from the shutdown of the U.S. economy.</p><p>If you strip out transportation, if you trip up the transports, air airplanes and things like that - trains, you get gain of 3.3 percent. That is to the upside. That's a little bit below the estimate of 3.5 percent. Anyway, so that is a little bit below what we were expecting there.</p><p>If you look at general machine orders, up to 2.7 percent; electrical equipment, up a gain of 1.2 percent; defense and aircraft parts, that's a big loss. That's interesting. That's a that's a strip out of 30.6 percent. That's actually a down side number.</p><p>But, again - so we're getting - we're pretty much steady on the Dow right now. But this is basically the pretty much in line with expectations, Dagen. So that's the breaking news on the U.S. economy.</p><p>One more thing I do want to look at before I send it back to you Dagen, and that's core capital goods month-over-month. That was better than expected. The gain was 3.3 percent. The expectation was 2.3 percent. So really, it's just - if you take out the transports that was the slight miss that we got. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. This is two straight months of durable goods orders increase after manufacturers, of course, ramping up production after the shutdowns. John, your reaction to this.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I focused on that better than expected reading on core capital goods orders, that tells us that perhaps a capital spending, business investment spending is at the start of a recovery.</p><p>And, by the way, I think CapEx has fared much better during the COVID-19 recession, compared to what happened during the Great Recession. That by itself brings attention to how this current recession is very different from past recessions and that the service sector is suffering the most far more than manufacturing is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, your reaction.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, I'm with John. I think, buried in all of this, in a good way, could be a revival of manufacturing. I think a lot of companies realized how vulnerable their supply chain was not just to China, but to other parts of the world. And I think as we begin to manufacture and assemble back here at home, I think you're going to see more and more investment in capital goods in order to enable that. So I think there's a nice silver lining here and these numbers even though they were slightly above or below expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much guys. Meantime, consulate turnover. U.S. officials clearing out of the Consulate General in Chengdu, China, after having Chinese officials do the same in Houston, Texas last week as tensions rise between Beijing and Washington.</p><p>Meantime, Chinese researcher, one was arrested by U.S. authorities, who was hiding out in China's San Francisco Consulate after allegedly lying to investigators about her Chinese military service. Her hearing is today. Joining me now China Beige Book CEO, Leland Miller. Leland, certainly, tensions worsening. Where do we go from here?</p><p>LELAND MILLER, CEO, CHINA BEIGE BOOK: Well, believe it or not, we're in the middle of a bit of a calm in the relationship. So things sound nasty. You've got a lot of rhetoric going back and forth between the two sides, but there hasn't anything on either side, including the consulate shutdowns that has escalated to the next step.</p><p>And I think part of that's because both sides have been focused on the pandemic and the economic recovery associated with the pandemic. I think that this is about the change. And it's about the change probably as soon as next month.</p><p>The phase one trade deal I think is in real trouble right now. You have a situation where if you lose that and you start moving into the fall, and you move into the run up to the election, which is going to be centered very much around China policy, you have the potential for this to get much, much worse in the next several months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What would you be on the lookout for?</p><p>MILLER: I think number one is the trade deal. And the reason it's so important is that the trade deal, to some degree, has kept the two sides in line, because President Trump if he wants his purchases, has to make sure to keep some of the more anti-China people in Congress, tough on China people in Congress at bay.</p><p>And I think that if this falls by the wayside, then it's going to be a scrum not just to the Republican side, but also the Democrat side to see who could look tough on about China into November. So this is really the bellwether for the fall.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get to this mysterious seeds from China. Agriculture departments from four states are warning people not to plant these seeds, in case they are are invasive species or could endanger other crops or livestock.</p><p>Based on photos, these seeds appear to have been mailed in white pouches displaying Chinese lettering and the words China Post. Leland, what do you know about this?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I know what I've read about this, which is it's probably just yet another scam coming out of China. If this is the first stage of biological warfare, then it's a pretty stupid time to be doing it.</p><p>So, look, if you're getting seeds from China don't plant them. There are laws against those types of seeds coming in the country. They should be enforced. A lot of this is coming through Amazon which needs to - we need to tighten its policies. But I look at things like this and I think there's much more chance you're just seeing a couple guys in China trying to make a few bucks than anything that's systemic or coming from Beijing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria spoke with Bridgewater Associates Co-Chairman Ray Dalio on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" yesterday about what investors need to think about before working with Chinese companies. Listen to this Leland, I'll get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know that you are a global investor and you look for growth across the world. Would you still want to invest in China given what we have learnt about the Communist Party?</p><p>RAY DALIO, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES CO-CHAIRMAN: I think there are three things - three big things going on and they operate together and those are the important ones. The first is where we are in the debt cycle, the printing of money, and that.</p><p>The second is how we are with each other. That we're having an ideological Civil War. And then you have the rising power of China challenging the existing power. We are in a conflict with China. You can call it a war like the 1930s. So that there is a - there's a trade war, there's a technology war, there is a geopolitical war, and there could be a capital war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Leland, what do you say to that?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I broadly agree with it. I think one of the things that's left unsaid there is that, the idea of decoupling is not flipping an on switch or flipping and off switch. There's a lot of degrees of decoupling that are involved. And I think what a lot of companies are doing right now is looking at the vulnerabilities in their supply chains. They're realizing that they have to do something about that whether it's because--</p><p>MCDOWELL: We lost Leland, but you know who can pick up that thought, Mitch Roschelle, because he's done so much work on it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, and--</p><p>MCDOWELL: Vulnerability - Mitch, vulnerability of supply change. Go.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. And the thing that I think became most apparent in all of this was how dependent we are for China for pharmaceuticals. And I think that the real interesting play here may be - no one's talking about USMCA the way they should be, and have the administration put that deal together and how we could domestically source in North America, a supply chain for pharmaceuticals and other vital elements for not just manufacturing, but just for our lives.</p><p>So I think the real story here is that the administration made that deal, and if we can get our act together with China and Mexico - excuse me, Mexico and Canada, we really could have less reliance on China and that could be a very strong sign for our economy going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Politically, Lee Carter, the strongest message out of President Trump when he was running for the highest office in the land was speaking to all of those Americans who had lost their jobs, their livelihoods, who had lost the safety net that they had with the company that they work for, because those jobs were shipped to other countries, particularly China over a period of decades. Does that still stand up here? Because you're really not hearing that specific message from the president as much as four years ago?</p><p>CARTER: You know, what's really interesting is right before the pandemic hit, the President was very much running on promises made, promises kept. And if you remember what he ran on? It was China, it was jobs, it was the economy, it was bringing manufacturing back. It was giving hope to these people who had lost it.</p><p>He was starting to talk about how he had brought back jobs, how he had gotten tough on China. And I think the President does need to start repeating that message, because it's really, really important to the American people. And the number one issue that's most important to Americans right now is jobs, is the economy and part of that is getting tough on China.</p><p>And so I think he does need to reframe this argument. I think the China narrative has sort of gotten away from him. And I think, frankly, it's time that he takes that back if he wants to get stronger on it as he gets close to election.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quickly. So the tagline from Joe Biden is \"Build Back Better,\" which reminds me of a children's book I had when I was little called the B Book. It was big brown bear, blue bull, blowing bubbles biking backward, bump black bug's banana boxes. Anyway, I've been wanting to say that on TV. I digress.</p><p>But in terms of \"Build Back Better,\" does that resonate with people? I know it's a lot of a alliteration from anxious anchors. But the - I don't know what that means. Are we build in back to our former relationship with China where we basically laid down and let that Communist country roll over us?</p><p>CARTER: I really think it's an interesting approach for him, because there was so much criticism about Donald Trump saying \"Make America Great Again,\" rather like going back, right? And now it's talking about making it better, as if. And so I think that there's going to be a lot of pushback on this.</p><p>And I think you're right. The question is what does this mean? The one thing that the President did when he was \"Make America Great Again,\" he had five signature policies. Everybody knew what they were, and you could repeat them over and over again. We're not sure what \"Build Back Better\" mean, and I think he's going to have to define it for us in very clear terms.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed, Lee Carter, thank you. Coming up, fleeing high tax blue state Joe Rogan setting his sights on Texas. Plus, treat for your heart, the new study shows how eating chocolate can lower your risk of heart disease. You're watching \"Mornings with Maria\" live on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The risk of sunscreen. A recent study from the Food and Drug Administration found six common chemicals found in sunscreen accumulate in the body at high levels. Studies in the past associating these ingredients with various health risk. Joining us now the Medical Director of CityMD Emergency and Family Medicine doctor, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Janette, great to see you. I've heard this before, but this is new.</p><p>DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, CITYMD MEDICAL DIRECTOR: Yes. So, Dagen, what they did was, the FDA conducted a study and they had participants apply sunblock to 75 percent of their body, and then they checked the bloodstream and checked the levels of these chemicals like oxybenzone, avobenzone, these are the first ingredients you see when you look at the back of the can of these sunscreens.</p><p>And they checked the bloodstream and they found that the chemicals, the sunscreen stayed in their system for up to 21 days. And the problem with that is, it could potentially be linked with maybe harmful effects to the body, maybe some hormonal disruptions and endocrine disruption, potentially some links to cancer.</p><p>But the American Academy of Dermatology still recommends to use sunscreen, because it's safer than the potential side effects of the sunscreen. And what the FDA also found was that there's two types of chemical - sunscreens. There's the mineral and there's chemical. Of course, they found that mineral was deemed safe and effective and is FDA approved. Mineral based sunscreens like zinc oxide, titanium dioxide were much safer.</p><p>So just keep in mind, when you apply all that sunblock, you go out in the sun, you come into contact with chlorine, a chemical reaction can occur and you could potentially have exposure to toxic chemical. So keep that in mind. Sunscreen is not the only way to protect yourself from the sun. You can wear sunglasses, wear proper clothing, stay in the shade, anytime you have that opportunity.</p><p>But we know that it's summertime, people are going to be out and about it. It's important to protect yourself, especially since skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in this country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Or umbrella, like a proper--</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: --like a proper laid out for a stroll or something I know--</p><p>NESHEIWAT: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: nothing about. But I don't know how an umbrella works.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good news for chocolate fans. Eating the delicious treat more than once a week could help lower your chances of developing coronary heart disease. This, according to a study from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Your reaction to this and is it dark chocolate versus no chocolate?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes, yes. So this was published in the Journal of Preventive Cardiology and the researchers wanted to see is there a significant link between coronary artery disease and eating chocolate. And they found that yes, if you eat chocolate about once a week in moderation, then potentially it can lower your blood pressure. It can improve blood flow and circulation to the brain and to your heart and might even have a positive impact on your HDL, which is the good cholesterol.</p><p>But the key is, which chocolate? Most likely it's the dark chocolate, because chocolates contain what's called polyphenols, flavonoids, flavonols, which are strong antioxidants. They help fight inflammation in the body, help protect your body against environmental toxins, so in that sense it can help reduce the inflammation in your blood vessels.</p><p>But the key is moderation and most likely it is dark chocolates, because they contain the most powerful, more amount I should say, of these antioxidants - the flavonoids, just like we see in fruits, vegetables and even some red wine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, right. I take Resveratrol which is derived from - which is - has the same effect as drinking red wine, but like taking a supplement just as not as much fun as having a glass of red wine.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You don't make friends that way. Dr. Janette, it's great to see you always.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Great to see you too, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Coming up, goodbye California. Joe Rogan ready to trade in the Golden State for some lone stars or one Lone Star State that is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The tax flight gets another name on the list. Joe Rogan says he's moving to Texas from Los Angeles. He explained the decision on his podcast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE ROGAN, THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE: I just want to go somewhere in the center of the country, somewhere, it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere we have a little bit more freedom. Also, I think that where we live right here in Los Angeles is overcrowded. When you look at the economic despair, when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically over the last six, seven, 10 years, I think there's too many people here. I think it's not tenable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This coming after - just days after Elon Musk announced that Tesla is going to build its largest auto plant near Austin, Texas. John, your reaction to this?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, people and companies vote with their feet if they don't like the tax climate, the regulatory climate, they are going to leave. If they get tired of riots and whatnot, they're not going to stay around. I mean, look what crime did to the once great city of Detroit. You have to take all of this into consideration. And who's ever ruling these states and cities has to make sure that the average American and businesses feel comfortable, that they're willing to grow within those regions.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Mitch, I'm going to quote the great poet Lyle Lovett, and say That's right. You're not from Texas. That's right. You're not from Texas. That's right. You're not from Texas, but Texas wants you anyway.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well, when California has a top marginal tax - income tax rate for individuals of 13.3 percent and Texas has a zero individual income tax rate, I think, that's a big catalyst for all the movement. Joe Rogan did not mention that in his remarks, but I - somehow I think he and his accountant had a conversation about it and that's part of the motivation as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, what do you make of this? I saw there was something going around on Twitter yesterday and it was a sign. It was a - I guess, it was a GOP sign that they put up in Texas saying, \"You came here, but don't bring your vote here. Mean, don't bring your big - big ass blue vote to this red state was the essence of the message.</p><p>CARTER: I think it's a fascinating thing to watch. If you look at what's happening to Florida, what's happening in Texas, there's a lot of migration there from blue states. What's interesting to me is that the local government and the governors are staying Republican, even though the states themselves are moving further and further towards the Left in a presidential election.</p><p>What that says to me is people want to keep their taxes low and they need to revisit, what are their values really, what do they want from the economy, what do they want from taxes and really get honest with themselves about what it is that they want to vote.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Space, they want space, just like Joe Rogan was talking about and I totally understand.</p><p>CARTER: Absolutely right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I totally understand that living in a 500 square foot apartment. More \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business live right after this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This Fox Business alert, Google is said to be keeping employees at home until at least July 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that's according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" The move impacts nearly all 200,000 full-time and contract workers across Google's parent company, Alphabet.</p><p>Mitch your reaction to this. This, potentially, as these large tech companies, maybe spread people out, and they are able to work from home. It would afford people an opportunity to work at a big tech company who lives in maybe a small red state.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, and I do wonder how much of their motivation is to broaden out their access to resources. But if other companies follow suit, without the goal of trying to access a wider net for talent pool, I think it could have an impact on commercial real estate, which it hasn't happened yet. But if we go out that far less demand for office space.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch Roschelle, thank you so much, sir. And Lee Carter and John Lonski, more with you guys next time. Thank you so much for being here. Varney &amp; Company is up right now, Stuart. Take it away.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Dagen, I do agree with you there. I think that news from Google this morning about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

If not paid, the breach is reported anonymously to the Data Protection Office, bringing the threat of large fines and regulatory nightmares.</p><p>Irish businesses need to protect themselves from an impending wave of cyber extortion as a result of this, according to cyber security expert James Canty, of Magnet Networks. \"After several years of cyber crime attacks, from May onwards we will now have GDPR legislation punishable by law if your business doesn't have adequate controls in place to protect any PII [personally identifiable information] it may be holding,\" he said.</p><p>\"This presents an opportunity for the 'ordinary cyber criminal' to obtain PII from a business and demand a ransom for not letting the authorities know they easily obtained your information.\"</p><p>Businesses targeted in this way receive an email with the sort of information the hackers have been able to extract. \"The demand would state that the appropriate protections are not in place in the company and that information was easily extracted,\" said Mr Canty.</p><p>\"The business will then be faced with three options - paying an extortion fee, taking the risk the criminals will report the stolen data anonymously to the Data Protection Officer, or self-declaring the data breach within 48 hours. Either of the latter two options will involve inspections, fines and a large amount of regulatory work.\"</p><p>\"Companies need to have a next-generation firewall along with advanced endpoint protection and local real-time analysis on each machine,\" he added.</p><p>What is GDPR? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new set of rules to radically tighten up privacy laws across the EU. It will affect every company and organisation. It means you have a lot more rights over how personal information is handled, stored and processed.</p><p>What is 'personal information'? Lots of it is the kind of stuff you would naturally expect, such as your name, your medical information or your bank details. But it also includes your IP address and location data from your phone. This is why it's such a big deal for some of the big tech companies, like Facebook, which bases its advertising model on this kind of info.</p><p>So is it mainly tech companies affected? Not at all. Any company (or organisation) that holds any personal information about you has to sit up and pay attention.</p><p>So what do these companies have to do? When a service needs your consent to use your personal information, it has to get it clearly now. So it can't, for instance, revert to obscure 'opt-out' boxes. And if some organisation suffers a serious data breach that is likely to affect you, it will now have to tell you about it. Ordinary people are now also supposed to have easier access to their personal data from companies as well as the right to transfer that data or have it deleted altogether.</p><p>When is this actually taking effect? Enforcement of the new rules comes into effect from Friday, May 25.</p><p>What does it mean if you run a business? An awful lot. For starters, non-adherence won't be treated with the typical slaps on the wrist that have existed up to now. The penalties include fines up to (EURO)20m or 4pc of global annual turnover. Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon said her office wouldn't hesitate to bring down the hammer. There won't be any bedding-in period. Lots of bigger businesses will need to appoint new staff, such as a data protection officer. Smaller companies will need to check their systems are compliant and that they have some procedure for dealing with the new rights that customers have.</p><p>What about social media - will it change? Anyone with a Facebook account will have noticed messages or pop-ups recently. Mainly, it has just made its settings a little more prominent and easier to adjust. It's the same for Instagram and Whatsapp (both owned by Facebook). They're asking you to \"review\" your privacy settings and to accept them or quit the services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-137351473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8N-N7B1-DY9P-N0SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 8, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The transfusion service does not have to tell them who will receive their blood and does not have to go back and ask for permission each time their blood is used.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Patient data is a similar resource - critical to our health system, specifically to health research and the development of diagnostics and therapies. Last month in Brussels the European Council announced agreement in principle to introduce a Europe-wide general regulation on data protection; some believe it will come before the end of the year.</p><p>Much focus has fallen on the response of the big tech companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and how the new rules might affect their business model. Our priority in Insight Ireland is the impact on the converging areas of health research and data science.</p><p>Insight Ireland took part in a day of action in Brussels to influence the shape of regulation and ensure health research is not stymied. The danger is that, in the drive to protect consumers from commercial exploitation of their data, we will also protect patients from significant potential benefits of health data analysis.</p><p>Commercial data regulation is in its infancy. Clinical research, on the other hand, operates under a significant system of regulation, and the patient-researcher relationship is very different to that between, for example, social networker and tech giant.</p><p>He gave that tissue freely along with the personal data that makes it even more valuable to the researcher. He is not worried that the tissue or the accompanying data will be abused. He has entered into a contract of trust with the researchers, in the knowledge that the appropriate safeguards are in place.</p><p>If a patient consents to participation in a clinical trial, is it necessary that that patient be contacted again for further studies and again for a medical analysis of results? If they die, must their data die with them or can it continue to inform research? Explicit consent is imperative when dealing with commercial interests in protecting personal data, but when a patient donates tissue and data for research purposes, can we infer consent for ongoing research? </p><p>The convergence of data analytics and health research offers incredible potential for human health. Right now at Insight Ireland we have data scientists and physiotherapists working together to devise ways of optimising outcomes for joint replacement patients. We are taking enormous data sets, derived by physical sensors developed in our labs, to optimise orthopaedic rehabilitation programmes in our hospitals. </p><p>Our work is attracting the attention of clinicians across the world. These therapies are only available because we have access to patient information, willingly donated for research purposes. We do not have to keep returning to these patients for ongoing consents; the data was given in the spirit of supporting our continuing work in health innovation. There are also significant safeguards in place to prevent the misuse of this data. The patient is protected even in the absence of his or her specific consent. The patient has, at any time, the option to withdraw consent.</p><p>The public attitude to data protection has been heavily influenced by the Silicon Valley powerhouses and their perceived data grabs. However, we must adopt a totally different attitude to the use of data in publicly funded health research in particular, as the public and individual interests are self-evident. We hope that what emerges from Europe in the coming months will support and foster the continuing progress of this vital and exciting new field of human health research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Prof Barry O'Sullivan is a director of the Insight Centre for Data Analytics and head of computer science at UCC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.2290719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GGG-YG71-DYS1-01V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 20, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal privacy is hot news, and, due to the lack of federal law to rule them all; the weight of enforcement is falling on state attorneys general.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A privacy bill just introduced in the District of Columbia is the latest evidence of an emerging patchwork of state-level privacy laws. The Security Breach Protection Amendment Act of 2019 (SBPAA) is designed to overhaul the district's data breach laws and improve protections for consumers' personal information.</p><p>SBPAA outlines various procedures that firms must abide by in the case of data breaches. This includes having to notify victims and inform the Office of the Attorney General in writing. As well as to provide two years of identity theft prevention services to any individual whose social security or tax identification number is breached.</p><p>If passed, the legislation would also require firms to begin implementing robust security standards against the unauthorized access and use of people's personal data.</p><p>The law would also seek to expound on the types of information that are considered sensitive to include social security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit or debit card numbers, passport numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, military ID numbers, health information, biometric data, genetic information and DNA profiles, as well as health insurance information.</p><p>SBPAA also clearly denotes that an individual's first name, first initial and last name, and any other personal identifier that either on its own or in combination with other data sets can be used to identify that individual - is \"personal information.\" Email addresses are also included in the definition.</p><p>However, unlike GDPR in the EU and CPPA in California, the new privacy law does not provide regulations on the collection of data, nor impose the need for consumer consent before data collection. In addition, it sets no limitations on the purposes for which data can be handled once it is collected.</p><p>Troublingly, there is also no specific mention of digital identifiers such as IP addresses within the categorization of \"personal information,\" which produces another concerning grey area.</p><p>For firms, SBPAA is a stark reminder that until a federal law is passed, providing adequate data privacy and security right across America is quickly becoming a logistical nightmare.</p><p>Law firms such as Dentons LLP have already noticed an uptick in tech companies seeking legal advice about navigating the emerging maze of state-level policies. And, those large law firms are responding by improving their understanding and expertise of those various legal environments.</p><p>There can be no doubt that improved data privacy protections - such as those created by California's CCPA and DC's SBPAA - are a step in the direction for consumer rights. However, there may be unintended side effects too.</p><p>The patchwork of distinct policies is inspiring tech firms to suddenly begin lobbying hard for a nationwide law. Firms know that having to cater to differing state laws will be both inconvenient and costly. Doing so will affect not only how data is accessed and stored in each location but also how it can be processed and shared across state boundary lines.</p><p>Advertising methods that could once legally span the entire US, will need to be adjusted in the same way that they have been since GDPR came into effect in the EU. For example, when GDPR came into effect a large number of US websites decided to stop providing their content in Europe. Now imagine the effect that similar laws could have across the US.</p><p>Simple systems that once created revenue without a fuss will suddenly become much trickier to manage and implement. Of course, firms could simply opt to adhere to the strictest privacy laws across the board. This would solve the problem, however, while there are lucrative profits to be made - it is like asking the baby to get out of the candy store.</p><p>Instead, big tech firms like Facebook and Google are leveraging the Internet Association to lobby the government for a nationwide federal privacy bill. That instantly causes alarm bells because until recently those same firms were dead against that very same kind of law. So why the turnaround?</p><p>Big Tech knows that the preemption doctrine written into the supremacy clause of Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution, allows for any federal privacy law to supersede all conflicting state laws, even if they that are part of the state's constitution. In other words, the ends justify the means.</p><p>Any federal privacy law that has the full support of Big Tech is more than likely going to be a watered down one size fits all bill designed to placate the public's desire for a GDPR-like law - while simultaneously permitting big tech to keep on processing data for profit.</p><p>For this reason, the new D.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-00000169-d884-d068-a56d-dda727bf0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSP-DPJ1-JCRW-53KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

Debate over political ads, privacy and the market power of the biggest companies were again front and center. And Facebook, the biggest target of criticism, picked up where it left off at the end of last year.</p><p>  Hi, I'm Cecilia Kang. I write for The New York Times about the tech industry's often fraught relationship with the regulators and lawmakers of Washington.</p><p>Facebook's tough week kicked off with a Times report on an internal company post by Andrew Bosworth, a senior executive of Facebook and a self-described liberal, who warned against actions that could thwart President Trump in the 2020 election.</p><p>  The post, obtained by Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac, was a winding, 2,500-word essay in defense of the social network and Mark Zuckerberg's stance on free expression -- including misinformation -- in political speech.</p><p>  The post from Mr. Bosworth, known as Boz and one of Mr. Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, didn't sit well with many employees who had grown uncomfortable with the company's hands-off approach. Other big social media companies, notably Twitter and Google, have set limits or banned political ads outright. </p><p>  Mr. Bosworth admitted Facebook probably helped elect Mr. Trump. But he said it was not for the reasons critics said. It wasn't Facebook's reckless handling of data, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of voters, that did it. It was Facebook's platform for targeted advertising that was so influential in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, he said, used that platform better than anyone.</p><p>  Alexis Madrigal of The Atlantic explained why Mr. Bosworth's internal post was so divisive in ''Why Facebook's Id is showing.'' Mr. Bosworth argued that Facebook did not really need to change. After all, it's not tobacco, he said. It's more like sugar -- not so bad if you don't consume too much of it.</p><p>  The next day, Facebook was caught up in an odd kerfuffle over a glowing article about five Facebook managers charged with defeating disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. The article, oddly, appeared in Teen Vogue without a byline. Why was Teen Vogue publishing an uncritical look at Facebook's election integrity efforts?</p><p>  It got weirder. A label was added that tagged the story as ''sponsored'' editorial. Then the label disappeared. Then the story disappeared. </p><p>  I dug into the mystery with my colleague Rachel Abrams. The article was, in fact, a piece of paid content. Teen Vogue and Facebook both said the labeling fracas was all a big misunderstanding.</p><p>  On Thursday, Facebook was back to serious news: It released its policy on political ads, cementing a decision to allow lies by politicians to go unchecked and for campaigns to micro-target those ads to specific audiences.</p><p>  The reaction was swift and partisan. The Trump campaign lauded the policy and other Republicans said it was an affirmation of free speech. Democrats, including the leading member of the Federal Election Commission, were angry, and said the decision was nothing short of a threat to democracy.</p><p>  Will the encryption fight be rebooted?</p><p>  The F.B.I. and Apple have reignited their battle over encryption. As reported by Jack Nicas and Katie Benner, the F.B.I. asked Apple for the data on two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in the shooting last month at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., possibly setting up another showdown over law enforcement's access to smartphones.</p><p>  This is an old battle, covered almost three years ago by Katie and Matt Apuzzo, now a European investigative reporter for The Times. At the heart of the dispute is a disagreement over user privacy and national security, and we'll be watching closely how this plays out.</p><p>  Sonos takes Google to court</p><p>  Antitrust enforcement of Big Tech will be a central focus for Washington regulators. And competitors are taking notice. Sonos sued Google in two federal courts. As reported by Jack Nicas and Daisuke Wakabayashi, the speaker company claims Google stole its secrets and used its market dominance to develop lower-priced speakers to squash competition. </p><p>  The case has the attention of a congressional committee investigating competition violations by Big Tech. Next Friday, the antitrust subcommittee of the House plans to take a road trip to Boulder, Colo., where Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos, is expected testify.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p/><p>  A cybersecurity company in Israel found major security flaws in the TikTok app. The fast-growing social media company said they have been fixed.</p><p>  A private equity firm wants to buy the internet domain used by nonprofit organizations.

Some 10 years and over 1600 initial coin offerings later, the world of crypto-, virtual and other digital currencies looks to have provoked an active response from financial sector leaders. However, this was sparked not by an entity with an established cryptocurrency profile, but by social media giant Facebook. In June 2019 the company introduced its digital currency Libra. Initially set to launch the following year, Facebook announced in March 2020 that it was considering a redesign of the Libra network. International media reported that, following widespread opposition to the project, Libra may be recast as a digital payment system accepting existing currencies, which would be able to support the Libra token at a later date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Central banks and global institutions spent the previous decade quietly watching the development of alternative currencies, but are now taking action after Facebook's announcement. They have made it clear that they perceive digital currencies as a threat to economic stability, and argue that having a leading technology company participate in the financial services landscape exacerbates that risk.</p><h>Growing Momentum</h><p>In January 2019 the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), a Switzerland-based organisation of central banks, stated that most central banks were \"not seeing the value'' in creating their own digital currencies. However, two weeks after the Libra announcement, Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the BIS, announced that multiple central banks were working on issuing their own digital currencies, and that the BIS is offering technical advice on how to do so.</p><p>According to a BIS survey published in 2019, more than two-thirds of the 63 banks surveyed were considering creating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). It is not yet clear to investors and financial sector experts whether digital currencies from the public and private sectors would be in direct competition - that depends on whether central banks design theirs with wholesale, or retail, banking in mind. Nonetheless, they appear ready to take on the risks inherent in moving outside their regulatory comfort zone - even as the Libra project has lost some steam due to the perceived challenges of getting approval from regulators worldwide. \"This is risky business,\" Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a non-profit think thank based in Washington, DC, told OBG. \"If CBDCs do not work, the credibility of the central bank could suffer.\"</p><p>Leadership in CBDCs has thus far come from Sweden, where the Riksbank's e-krona is a key part of that country's strategy to abandon paper money; and from China, where the People's Bank of China has been working on a digital currency that, as of early 2020, had been \"progressing smoothly\", according to the central bank. Another innovator is Tunisia, which already has a digital currency, the e-dinar, established by the national postal service, and whose central bank is also considering a CBDC. Furthermore, in Indonesia, where Bitcoin is tradeable but banned for payments, Agus Martowardojo, governor of the Bank Indonesia, said in early 2018 that a digital rupiah issued by the central bank could be a year or two away; however, no further announcements had been made as of February 2020. The list of possible CBDC issuers also includes Thailand, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Peru, among others.</p><h>Gauging Interest</h><p>Meanwhile, some central banks are sticking with the BIS' previous position that issuing their own digital currencies is not necessary. These include the central banks of the US, Singapore and the Philippines, the latter of which is a key player in global financial flows due to its position as the fourth-biggest recipient of global remittances. In these countries, the likely approach to alternative currencies will be regulation.</p><p>\"We have to be open to innovation [while at the same time maintaining responsibility to the] consumer,\" Benjamin Diokno, governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, told local press in July 2019. Many have noted that in places that are already open to financial innovation - such as Kenya, the first country in which mobile money platforms were available - regulatory approaches often require technology companies to partner with banks.</p><p>In Mexico the central bank believes there would be no demand for CBDCs unless users are ensured anonymity, though that could aid money-laundering and other illicit financial flows. \"At one extreme, full anonymity [and] protecting user privacy may facilitate the execution of illegal activities,\" Javier Guzm\u00e1n Calafell, deputy governor at Banco de M\u00e9 xico, said in a speech in July 2019. \"At the other end, perfect traceability may hinder interest in CBDCs from users who, for personal and perhaps completely legitimate reasons, prefer to keep part of their transactions unrecorded.\"</p><h>Libra</h><p>One of the challenges Facebook's Libra proposal presents is how to define and categorise it. Digital currency is the umbrella term for all cryptoand virtual currencies, and experts do not agree on what type of digital currency Facebook and its partners are proposing, nor how it should be regulated. Juan Casta\u00f1eda, a senior lecturer in economics at the UK's University of Buckingham, told OBG that Libra would allow its users to make payments and transfer money. Banking regulators, however, see it as a financial services product that should be regulated as banking products are. This would require Facebook and its partners in the project to shoulder some of the same responsibilities as banks, such as active and ongoing customer due diligence to avoid money-laundering and other illicit financial flows. From the perspective of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the currency should be classified as a security because it could deliver investment income to its partners. Though Facebook has said that it is flexible on the details, it is likely Libra will not be a floating currency like Bitcoin. The initial plan included pegging Libra's value to a basket of conventional currencies, likely large and stable ones such as the dollar, euro and sterling. For each Libra in circulation, there would be a unit of these currencies held in an account called the Libra Reserve. This has led some to call the Libra a stablecoin, since the value of the Libra would be unlikely to drop below the value of the conventional currencies underlying it.</p><h>Blockchain Tweak</h><p>The Libra also stands out from Bitcoin in how it proposes to use blockchain technology. Bitcoin has helped to popularise blockchain as a permissionless system, in which participation and execution are transparent. For Libra, however, only those with permission are able to view the electronic data trail and track its activity. Access would be limited to members of the Libra Association, a not-for-profit group to be based in Geneva, Switzerland. These entities would then serve as an intermediary that can access the ledger, exchange Libra for hard currencies and offer customers digital wallets in which to store their Libra. In March 2020 Facebook announced that its separate Calibra digital wallet, which is slated to launch in the fourth quarter that year, will also support other government-issued currencies in an effort to gain additional support for the platform.</p><h>Fast Response</h><p>While central banks have responded to Libra by speeding up their deliberative processes around crypto-, digital and other alternative currencies, and by considering offering their own versions, it is not clear that CBDCs would be a natural competitor or alternative to a proposal like Libra, Casta\u00f1eda said. \"Libra would mostly be a payment system,\" he told OBG. \"Whereas Bitcoin is a new currency that stands on its own and is a competitor.\" This suggests that, regardless of what central banks around the world are currently considering or intend to react to, a CBDC does not have to be a response to only Libra, and may not be meant for as widespread of use as Libra. Rather, they could be complementary products.</p><h>CBDC Benefits</h><p>With a number of central banks now looking at establishing their own CBDCs, a basic set of arguments has emerged for and against the concept. Some do not apply to all countries, or do not apply with equal force. Venezuela and Iran, for example, see CBDCs as a way to cope with US sanctions that prevent them from fully participating in the current global payments system. This is different to Sweden's cashless motivation for issuing a CBDC. Still other central banks envision CBDCs as a general control mechanism rather than a purely financial one, namely the People's Bank of China, which views it as a tool to preserve control over the digital economy, and potentially one for surveillance.</p><p>For most, however, arguments for a CBDC generally include preserving control over monetary and economic stability in the way central banks have always done, promoting financial inclusion, and making cross-border financial flows faster and cheaper. To the IMF, CBDCs are seen as a way to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets, as mobile access to a digital currency could be easier for people in remote places or those facing language barriers. It is with this goal in mind that Tunisia introduced its e-dinar.</p><p>For Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a digital currency might help speed up the process of moving money across borders. In January 2019 the Arabian Peninsula neighbours announced a pilot project for a digital currency called Aber. As of February 2020 details on its progress had not been made public, but the proposed model seeks to address the wholesale market, allowing banks to use Aber to facilitate financial settlements. In Asia the Bank of Thailand is investigating a similar structure in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as part of a CBDC study called Project Inthanon-LionRock, and released its findings in January 2020. The study concluded that its cross-border corridor network promotes better settlement efficiency; however, legal and regulatory challenges remain, and further exploration will be needed in the project's next stages According to Chorzempa, there are multiple ways CBDCs could speed up financial flows while making them cheaper. Some also reduce counterparty risk and boost efficiency. \"It is basically 'programmable' money,\" he told OBG. \"There can be smart contracts in which payments between counterparties could be automatically triggered by certain conditions.\"</p><h>Risks &amp; Drawbacks</h><p>The promise of CBDCs is matched by the risks they could engender, such as loss of monetary policy control, privacy and security issues, and the decline of cash as a counterweight. Existing cryptocurrencies can offer a lesson here: there is significant demand for cryptocurrencies as an investment or an asset class to be traded by investors, but their use as a way to pay for goods or services has been far more limited. This could suggest low retail demand for CBDCs as well.</p><p>Concerns over whether CBDCs could erode central bank control over monetary policy are currently being discussed. If more business is transacted via digital currencies, that reduces the role of conventional banks as a financial intermediary, which in turn reduces the role of benchmark interest rates on loans from central banks to conventional banks. Interest rates are the core tool of modern monetary policy that enables central banks to promote financial stability in their economies. However, some analysts have suggested these fears may be overblown. The IMF, for example, believes these risks are minimal. One way to reduce risk while still having CBDCs as a retail option would be to forbid consumers from holding actual accounts at the central bank, and establish intermediaries to do this instead, just as conventional banks do for fiat currency. In a similar vein, the Libra Association is planning to offer its users digital wallets instead of allowing them direct access to the system.</p><h>Regulatory Checks</h><p>An e-wallet provider would be in charge of performing important regulatory functions such as anti-money-laundering and knowyour-client checks. This kind of oversight presents its own risk for privacy and security breaches. \"Facebook promises that sending money would be as easy as sending a text message, but they do not have to do customer background checks for that,\" Heike Mai, a Frankfurt-based banking analyst for Deutsche Bank, said. \"You cannot just ask people to click a box to accept terms and conditions. You have to monitor your clients. But if they can do that, I do not see a big problem.\"</p><p>The BIS has raised concerns that digital currencies could lead to a more direct presence of the world's biggest tech firms in the financial services industry, which it believes could undermine the banking sector and economic stability. Even though some of the world's largest banks have failed to meet their regulatory responsibilities at times, they remain a partner that central banks have relationships with and know how to regulate, Teunis Brosens, lead economist for digital finance and regulation at the Netherlands' ING Bank, told OBG.</p><h>Combined Effort</h><p>Central banks' willingness to experiment with digital currencies has seen greater momentum as big tech firms express interest in entering the financial services sector. For now it remains unclear whether CBDCs can or will fully replace, or completely eliminate the need or desire for private sector digital currencies. Nevertheless, given that the global infrastructure for cross-border payments needs to be updated, blockchain and other new technologies could play a role, Brosens said.

Some 10 years and over 1600 initial coin offerings later, the world of crypto-, virtual and other digital currencies looks to have provoked an active response from financial sector leaders. However, this was sparked not by an entity with an established cryptocurrency profile, but by social media giant Facebook. In June 2019 the company introduced its digital currency Libra, promising a launch date in 2020. Central banks and global institutions spent the previous decade watching the development of alternative currencies, but are now taking action after Facebook's announcement. They have made it clear that they perceive digital currencies as a threat to economic stability, and argue that having a leading technology company participate in the financial services landscape exacerbates that risk. According to Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Facebook's size and global reach would make Libra an instant and systemic risk.</p><h>Growing Momentum</h><p>In January 2019 the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), a Switzerland-based organisation of central banks, stated that most central banks were \"not seeing the value'' in creating their own digital currencies. However, two weeks after the Libra announcement, Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the BIS, announced that multiple central banks were working on issuing their own digital currencies, and that the BIS is offering technical advice on how to do so. According to a BIS survey published in 2019, more than two-thirds of the 63 banks surveyed were considering creating central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While most of the banks have not explicitly stated that the goal of their offering is to crowd out Libra, the European Central Bank has more directly said it plans to establish its own digital currency in response to the Libra proposal. It is not yet clear whether digital currencies from the public and private sectors would be in direct competition - that depends on whether central banks design theirs with wholesale, or retail, banking in mind. Nonetheless, they appear ready to take on the risks inherent in moving outside their regulatory comfort zone - even as the Libra project has lost some steam due to the perceived challenges of getting approval from regulators. \"This is risky business,\" Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a non-profit think thank based in Washington, DC, told OBG. \"If CBDCs do not work, the credibility of the central bank could suffer.\"</p><p>Leadership in CBDCs has thus far come from Sweden, where the Riksbank's e-krona is a key part of that country's strategy to abandon paper money; and from China, where the People's Bank of China has been working on a digital currency that, as of early 2020, was \"progressing smoothly\", according to the central bank. Another innovator is Tunisia, which already has a digital currency, the e-dinar, established by the national postal service, and whose central bank is also considering a CBDC. Furthermore, in Indonesia, where Bitcoin is tradeable but banned for payments, Agus Martowardojo, governor of the Bank Indonesia, said in early 2018 that a digital rupiah issued by the central bank could be a year or two away; however, no further announcements had been made as of February 2020.</p><h>Gauging Interest</h><p>Meanwhile, some central banks are sticking with the BIS' previous position that issuing their own digital currencies is not necessary. These include the central banks of the US, Singapore and the Philippines, the latter of which is a key player in global financial flows due to its position as the fourth-biggest recipient of global remittances. In these countries, the likely approach to alternative currencies will be regulation. \"We have to be open to innovation [while at the same time maintaining responsibility to the] consumer,\" Benjamin Diokno, governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, told local press in July 2019. Many have noted that in places that are already open to financial innovation - such as Kenya, the first country in which mobile money platforms were available - regulatory approaches often require technology companies to partner with banks. In Mexico the central bank believes there would be no demand for CBDCs unless users are ensured anonymity, though that could aid money-laundering and other illicit financial flows. \"At one extreme, full anonymity [and] protecting user privacy may facilitate the execution of illegal activities,\" Javier Guzm\u00e1n Calafell, deputy governor at Banco de M\u00e9xico, said in a speech in July 2019. \"At the other end, perfect traceability may hinder interest in CBDCs from users who, for personal and perhaps completely legitimate reasons, prefer to keep part of their transactions unrecorded.\"</p><h>Libra</h><p>Digital currency is the umbrella term for all crypto- and virtual currencies, and experts do not agree on what type of digital currency Facebook and its partners are proposing, nor how it should be regulated. Juan Casta\u00f1eda, a senior lecturer in economics at the UK's University of Buckingham, told OBG that Libra would allow its users to make payments and transfer money. Banking regulators, however, see it as a financial services product that should be regulated as banking products are. This would require Facebook and its partners in the project to shoulder some of the same responsibilities as banks, such as active and ongoing customer due diligence to avoid money-laundering and other illicit financial flows. From the perspective of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the currency should be classified as a security because it could deliver investment income to its partners. Though Facebook has said that it is flexible on the details, it is likely Libra will not be a floating currency like Bitcoin. The initial plan included pegging Libra's value to a basket of conventional currencies, likely large and stable ones such as the dollar, euro and sterling. For each Libra in circulation, there would be a unit of these currencies held in an account called the Libra Reserve. This has led some to call the Libra a stablecoin, since the value of the Libra would not likely drop below the value of the conventional currencies underlying it. It would bring specific benefits to the countries whose currencies are in the basket, in the form of increased foreign exchange demand, and a motivation to keep its value stable. \"Central banks would have an incentive to maintain the value of their currencies, because they would want Libra to use them,\" Casta\u00f1eda told OBG.</p><h>Blockchain Tweak</h><p>The Libra also stands out from Bitcoin in how it proposes to use blockchain technology. Bitcoin has helped to popularise blockchain as a permissionless system, in which participation and execution are transparent. For Libra, however, only those with permission are able to view the electronic data trail and track its activity. Access would be limited to members of the Libra Association, a not-forprofit group to be based in Geneva, Switzerland. These entities would then serve as an intermediary that can access the ledger, exchange Libra for hard currencies and offer customers digital wallets in which to store their Libra. The association initially had 28 members, including payments companies, venture capital firms, blockchain companies, telecommunications providers and non-profit organisations. However, by October 2019 the group had shrunk to 21, as Mastercard, Paypal and others decided to end their involvement. Holders of Libra would not earn interest on balances held in their digital wallets, like they would with conventional money held in a bank account, but would gain flexibility in international payments and benefit from lower fees and faster transfers. This would leave the Libra Reserve with a pool of capital it plans to invest in low-risk instruments such as government bonds. These would earn a return on investment, which would be used by the Libra Association to cover costs. Anything left over would accrue to its members. This structure gives Libra sufficient similarities to a pooled investment fund, which triggered the US Securities and Exchange Commission's review to determine whether it should regulate aspects of the new currency offering.</p><h>Fast Response</h><p>While central banks have responded to Libra by speeding up their deliberative processes around crypto-, digital and other alternative currencies, and by considering offering their own versions, it is not clear that CBDCs would be a natural competitor or alternative to a proposal like Libra, Casta\u00f1eda said. \"Libra would mostly be a payment system,\" he told OBG. \"Whereas Bitcoin is a new currency that stands on its own and is a competitor.\" This suggests that, regardless of what central banks have in mind or intend to react to, a CBDC does not have to be a response to only Libra, and may not be meant for as widespread of use as Libra. Rather, they could be complementary products. Central bank pilot projects such as those in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Thailand have focused on using CBDCs in the wholesale banking market to ease flows between banks rather than between people, and in systems in which only banks can use them.</p><h>CBDC Benefits</h><p>With a number of central banks now looking at establishing their own CBDCs, a basic set of arguments has emerged for and against the concept. Some do not apply to all countries, or do not apply with equal force. Venezuela and Iran, for example, see CBDCs as a way to cope with US sanctions that prevent them from fully participating in the current global payments system. This is different to Sweden's cashless motivation for issuing a CBDC. Still other central banks envision CBDCs as a general control mechanism rather than a purely financial one, namely the People's Bank of China, which views it as a tool to preserve control over the digital economy, and potentially one for surveillance.</p><p>For most, however, arguments for a CBDC generally include preserving control over monetary and economic stability in the way central banks have always done, promoting financial inclusion, and making cross-border financial flows faster and cheaper. To the IMF, CBDCs are seen as a way to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets, as mobile access to a digital currency could be easier for people in remote places or those facing language barriers. It is with this goal in mind that Tunisia introduced its e-dinar.</p><p>For Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a digital currency might help speed up the process of moving money across borders. In January 2019 the Arabian Peninsula neighbours announced a pilot project for a digital currency called Aber. As of February 2020 details on its progress had not been made public, but the proposed model seeks to address the wholesale market, allowing banks to use Aber to facilitate financial settlements. According to Chorzempa, there are multiple ways CBDCs could speed up financial flows while making them cheaper. \"It is basically 'programmable' money,\" he told OBG. \"There can be smart contracts in which payments between counterparties could be automatically triggered by certain conditions.\" Tax collectors could use this technology as well, such as by creating automated payment systems for value-added taxes as goods clear Customs, eliminating bureaucratic hassle on both sides of the transaction.</p><h>CBDC Drawbacks</h><p>The promise of CBDCs is matched by the risks they could engender, such as loss of monetary policy control, privacy and security issues, and the decline of cash as a counterweight. Existing cryptocurrencies can offer a lesson here: there is significant demand for cryptocurrencies as an investment or an asset class to be traded by investors, but their use as a way to pay for goods or services has been far more limited. This could suggest low retail demand for CBDCs as well. For example, the Ethereum blockchain platform handles an average of 15 transactions per second, compared to Visa's global platform, which handles approximately 24,000 per second. Concerns over whether CBDCs could erode central bank control over monetary policy are currently being discussed. If more business is transacted via digital currencies, that reduces the role of conventional banks as a financial intermediary, which in turn reduces the role of benchmark interest rates on loans from central banks to conventional banks. Interest rates are the core tool of modern monetary policy that enables central banks to promote stability in their economies. However, some analysts have suggested these fears may be overblown. One way to reduce risk while still having CBDCs as a retail option would be to forbid consumers from holding actual accounts at the central bank, and establish intermediaries to do this instead, just as conventional banks do for fiat currency. In a similar vein, the Libra Association is planning to offer its users digital wallets instead of allowing them direct access to the system.</p><h>Regulatory Checks</h><p>An e-wallet provider would be in charge of performing important regulatory functions such as anti-money-laundering and know-your-client checks. This kind of oversight presents a its own risk for privacy and security breaches. \"Facebook promises that sending money would be as easy as sending a text message, but they do not have to do customer background checks for that,\" Heike Mai, a Frankfurt-based banking analyst for Deutsche Bank, said. \"You cannot just ask people to click a box to accept terms and conditions. You have to monitor your clients. But if they can do that, I do not see a big problem.\" The same regulatory responsibilities would apply to central banks that issue CBDCs and allow direct retail access. The BIS has raised concerns that digital currencies could lead to a more direct presence of the world's biggest tech firms in the financial services industry, which it believes could undermine the banking sector and economic stability. Even though some of the world's largest banks have failed to meet their regulatory responsibilities at times, they remain a partner that central banks have relationships with and know how to regulate, Teunis Brosens, lead economist for digital finance and regulation at the Netherlands' ING Bank, told OBG.</p><h>Combined Effort</h><p>Central banks' willingness to experiment with digital currencies has seen greater momentum as big tech firms express interest in entering the financial services sector. For now it remains unclear whether CBDCs can or will fully replace, or eliminate the need or desire for private sector digital currencies. Nevertheless, given that the global infrastructure for cross-border payments needs to be updated, blockchain and other new tech could play a role, Brosens said. Regardless of how the future landscape for digital currencies pans out, it will require the combined expertise of private firms and central banks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBGART-956112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBGART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXH-NS21-DXYV-71NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468537</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Oxford Business Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oxford Business Group: Articles</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13017\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This is your CQ Cyber newsletter for Thursday, March 14, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOPLINES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Antitrust in the Air: In a matter of just two decades, tech companies that started out as darlings have become giants with such power and reach that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are starting to call for ways to break up the monopoly power. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Google Gets Grilled: Google, which had largely escaped the scrutiny that befell Facebook and Twitter in the aftermath of the 2016 election, was under spotlight at a hearing on data privacy. Senators expressed alarm at how much information Google and its Android mobile device collect on users. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. Data Privacy in Doubt: Getting a federal data privacy bill passed could come down to the legislation's details and whether it should take precedence over state laws. Those debates could delay passage of a national privacy bill this year. </p><p>4. $10 Billion for Cyber: The White House this week released a budget request for fiscal year 2020 that showed the Trump administration seeking a little more than $10 billion for cybersecurity efforts across a handful of top federal departments. </p><p>5. Cyber Commandos: The Pentagon's Cyber Command sent some of its experts to Europe before the U.S. midterm elections to help foil any potential attacks or interference.</p><p>6.  A New IOT Bill: A bipartisan group of lawmakers in both chambers introduced a bill this week that would let federal agencies buy only those internet connected devices that meet certain security standards. </p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Tech Companies' Power, Reach Prompt Calls for Antitrust Action </p><p>When Facebook and Google emerged on the tech scene, they were the darlings of a new age because of their scrappy origin stories. But two decades or so later, lawmakers are concerned about the reach and power of these companies to reshape society and potentially undermine democracy. </p><p>CQ's Dean DeChiaro lays out how the laissez-faire thinking about Big Tech is changing, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling for breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon. And the Federal Trade Commission is forming a new tech-focused antitrust task force. </p><p>Read his story here.</p><p>2. Google Comes Under Spotlight as Senators Debate Privacy Bill</p><p>Senators on the Judiciary Committee grilled a Google executive on the company's data collection and sharing practices as Congress prepares to draw up a federal data privacy bill. </p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who as Missouri's attorney general investigated Google's violation of the state's antitrust and consumer protection law, said the company tracked users and collected information without giving them an adequate choice to opt out. </p><p>Google's practices were like the Eagles band's \"Hotel California\" song ...\"You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave,\" Hawley said. \"That's a problem this Congress has to address.\" </p><p>Read my story here.</p><p>3. National Data Privacy Law Faces Long Odds as States Push Ahead </p><p>Lawmakers want to pass a federal data privacy bill before 2020 to put Washington on par with Europe and ahead of several U.S. states. But those efforts could be delayed because of differences between technology companies and Congress over how powerful the law should be and how it should be structured. </p><p>A delay in enacting a uniform federal law could leave technology giants and startup app makers trying to meet a latticework of standards set by many states as well as a growing international set of rules being modeled after the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Companies also could be liable for fines and face consumer lawsuits allowed by state laws. </p><p>The cost and complexity of complying with such a regulatory system was one of the hot topics at the annual RSA Conference in San Francisco last week, which brought together more than 40,000 security and privacy experts.</p><p>While hundreds of vendor booths filled a cavernous hall in the Moscone Center, venue speakers discussed minutiae of GDPR compliance and preparing for California's Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which becomes effective in January 2020.</p><p>Read my story from the conference here.</p><p>4. White House Seeks 18 Percent More for Cybersecurity in 2020</p><p>The White House this week proposed a fiscal 2020 budget that among other items seeks an 18 percent combined increase in funding for cybersecurity efforts when counting up the amounts at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy. </p><p>Separately, the Justice Department said the FBI would request about $72.5 million in fiscal 2020 to hire more officers and agents to boost the agency's cyber information sharing abilities, cyber tools and capabilities. The money also would fund programs to secure the department's own computer networks, the statement said.</p><p>Read my story here. </p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will ask Congress for about $161 million in fiscal 2020 to continue focusing on telemarketing scams and identity theft, my colleague Dean DeChiaro reports here.</p><p>5. Cyber Command Sent Experts to Europe in Advance of U.S. Midterm Election</p><p>The U.S. Cyber Command sent its experts to three European countries ahead of the 2018 midterms as part of the Pentagon's new policy to deny adversaries the ability to inflict harm on the United States, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the command, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We sent defensive teams to three different European countries. ... That's acting outside of our borders to impose costs against our adversaries,\" Nakasone told the panel's subcommittee on intelligence and emerging threats and capabilities. Nakasone did not name the countries.</p><p>Nakasone, who also heads the U.S. National Security Agency, said the Cyber Command and the agency worked together to provide \"indicators of compromise\" to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which then advised other agencies and election officials on the nature of potential threats.</p><p>U.S. intelligence agencies as well as the Justice Department and DHS have said that the 2018 midterm elections were not affected by foreign interference.</p><p>The Cyber Command is at the forefront of a new cybersecurity strategy authorized by President Donald Trump to push back against attempts by Russia and others to interfere in the U.S. elections process.</p><p>Under the new strategy, the Cyber Command is authorized to act decisively, and that includes \"everything from understanding what the adversaries are doing within their networks, providing early warning, ensuring that we understand the malware, infrastructure and other capabilities that an adversary might be accumulating to perhaps conduct an action against the United States,\" Nakasone said.</p><p>Nakasone said the command's cyber experts penetrate adversaries' networks to figure out potential lines of attack against the United States.</p><p>But the Pentagon is careful to ensure that such stepped up U.S. efforts do not cross a threshold that could trigger violent responses from adversaries, Kenneth Rapuano, the Pentagon's principal cyber adviser, told lawmakers.</p><p>\"We have a thoughtful process but also designed to operate with speed of relevance,\" Rapuano said of the process the Pentagon follows to determine how to push back against adversaries.  </p><p>6. Bipartisan Bill Would Require Fed Agencies to buy Only Secure IoT Devices</p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., proposed legislation that would require federal government agencies to buy only those internet-connected devices that meet minimum standards of security.</p><p>The bill (S 734) is backed by Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Steve Daines, R-Mont. A companion bill (HR 1668) in the House is backed by Reps. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., and Will Hurd, R-Texas, Warner's office said in a statement this week. </p><p>While internet-connected devices --  often called the Internet of Things -- offer great convenience, \"I'm also concerned that many IoT devices are being sold without appropriate safeguards and protections in place, with the device market prioritizing convenience and price over security,\" Warner said in a statement.</p><p>By pushing federal agencies to buy devices with security standards, the lawmakers hope that makers of such devices would move toward tighter security earlier in their design and manufacturing process. </p><p>Typically IoT devices are shipped out and manufacturers do not update the underlying software, unlike laptops and mobile phones. Users also are unaware of how to change passwords on such devices, making them vulnerable to hacking. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

That June, a Facebook data scientist and two academics released a paper demonstrating that users could be emotionally manipulated based on the information Facebook's engineers fed into their accounts.The conclusions of the study were alarming. But even more shocking was the means by which researchers had reached them. Facebook had used 700,000 of its users as social science guinea pigs without their consent. </p><p>Not only could Facebook manipulate its users; ithad manipulated them, without any regard to the ethical implications.A firestorm of bad press[2] and user[3]fury[4] ensued. Then, in December 2015, The Guardian reported[5] that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had harvested 'psychological data' from millions of Facebook users for his presidential campaign, relying on a small firm known as Cambridge Analytica.These were the days before Facebook had been weaponized to incite genocide[6] in Myanmar or livestream[7] mass shootings in New Zealand or proliferate the far-right propaganda[8] that helped elect Donald Trump. But there were plenty of indications that something was amiss with the world's most popular social network \u2015 which was already under a November 2011 consent order[9] from the Federal Trade Commission requiring the company to take better care of user data and privacy.At that time, Kamala Harris[10] was the top state law enforcement official overseeing Facebook and every other major tech company in Silicon Valley. As attorney general of California, she possessed sweeping powers to restrain the growing power of those tech platforms.'There's a lot that attorneys general across the country could have done to rein in Big Tech,' according to Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank. 'Most notably, challenging the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers.' Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from either an antitrust or a consumer protection perspective. Those acquisitions took place in 2012 and 2014, during Harris' tenure as AG. And yet Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from an antitrust perspective, nor brought legal action against them on consumer protection grounds. Even well into her 2020 presidential campaign, she pursued a soft touch with Big Tech, issuing vague promises[11] to secure consumer privacy protections as her rivals for the Democratic nomination \u2015 particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2015 vowed to break up Facebook and implement ambitious new regulatory regimes.More than 1,400 pages of emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request help explain this inaction, showing that Harris generally viewed Big Tech as a partner rather than a threat. At times, she even teamed up with tech companies to market herself as a rising star in American politics \u2015 a depiction that proved correct with her election to the Senate in 2016.Today, Harris is a leading contender for the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination. One of the most pressing questions for the next administration will be how it chooses to grapple with the corporate behemoths that have come to dominate American culture. This look inside Harris' record with Big Tech suggests a politician who identifies with the tech elite and is wary of substantive reform. Leaning In, Leaning Out In February 2013, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote to Harris asking for a glossy photograph of the AG and a personal anecdote demonstrating how Harris had 'leaned in.' Sandberg was looking for stories of powerful women proving their mettle in the male-dominated upper echelons of American power, from boardrooms to statehouses. As the top law enforcement official in the biggest state in the country, Harris was a natural target.Sandberg was asking Harris to participate in a massive PR rollout for her soon-to-be-released book 'Lean In.' The 'Lean In' marketing campaign was intimately connected to Facebook itself. Ordinary women who wanted to follow the Lean In movement had to sign up[12] through a Facebook account and 'like' Lean In to receive further career advice.Harris passed along a headshot and her own 'Lean In' story \u2015 a tale of how she got her start in electoral politics running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 as a long-shot upstart who defeated several well-connected male challengers.Harris was far from the only public figure to join in the marketing splash. When Lean Incame out in March 2013, Sandberg's memoir was celebrated as a women's rights triumph \u2015 a road map to everything women could aspire to be in the corporate hierarchy. 'Sandberg is not just tough,' wrote Anne-Marie Slaughter in a glowing[13] New York Times review. 'She also comes across as compassionate, funny, honest and likable' \u2015 everything an ambitious young woman could hope to be. Slaughter was a former State Department official about to be named head of the New America Foundation, a liberal think tank.So nobody made a fuss about a state law enforcement official joining a PR push for a top official at a company she ostensibly policed. The idea that either Sandberg or her company represented any kind of public policy problem was beyond the scope of what most politicians considered political.But there were rumblings that the platforms \u2015 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2015 were losing control of what they had created. In 2013, public fury began to mount over revenge porn, a practice in which men posted nude or compromising photos or videos of ex-girlfriends hoping to humiliate them. Revenge porn specialists were typically isolated grifters, but the tech giants gave them public reach. A website in a lonely corner of the internet wouldn't get much traffic if Google, Facebook and Twitter never directed anybody to it, or refused to host such images on their platforms.As AG, Harris made revenge porn a signature issue, eventually broadening the scope of her crackdown to include all 'cyber exploitation' \u2015 efforts to profit from abuse, particularly of women, online. But she didn't go after the tech companies themselves. In 2013, she brought a case against Kevin Bollaert, the 27-year-old founder of UGotPosted.com, a site that invited misogynists to post photos of their exes. Bollaert was also the founder of ChangeMyReputation.com, a site that charged people a fee to take down those damaging photos. It was a clever scam: letting bad actors post material without consent on one site and then forcing victims to pay him to take it down through another site.Harris threw the book at Bollaert, who was eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison. For women's rights activists, it was a victory \u2015 free speech claims online didn't include efforts to humiliate people sexually without their consent.'She took on cyber exploitation,' says Danielle Citron, a law professor at Boston University who received a MacArthur Foundation 'Genius' grant in 2019. 'No other AG in the country did that.' Citron is a vice president at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which has received funding from Facebook and Twitter.Harris's arguments in the case explicitly shielded Silicon Valley from any potential implications of a guilty verdict. Bollaert was responsible for what happened on his site because he was a publisher, not a neutral platform.But as it became increasingly impossible to ignore the role Big Tech was playing in the revenge porn problem, Harris sent company representatives a note on Jan. 9, 2015, inviting them to her San Francisco office for a Feb. 4 meeting. The emails don't indicate much about what occurred during that discussion, but six days later, Harris appeared onstage with Sandberg[14] at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, smiling and waving to the crowd before giving a talk about cyberbullying.The emails show that Harris convened private meetings for her cyber exploitation program throughout most of the year, finally launching the initiative as a public campaign in October of 2015. Tech companies committed to changing the way they monitored abusive content on their platforms. Harris praised their efforts in a June 2015 Marie Claire profile, which her office repeatedly emailed out to representatives from the firms over the months ahead of the October launch.'I asked some online companies to come in for a meeting about how we could create a safer environment online,' Harris told Marie Claire[15]. 'They were wonderful. Many companies really want to lead on this issue.'According to a February 2019 Politico profile[16], Harris relied on an advocacy tactic known as 'interest convergence theory,' which maintains that activists have better success with reform projects when they align their goals with the interests of powerful institutions. Showing Facebook and Google that revenge porn was hurting their bottom line would help bring them along. The problem with this reasoning is that in many cases, the reason Big Tech directly profits from socially destructive policies.'Revenge porn, election integrity, the destruction of journalism \u2015 you can't fix any of these problems at Facebook without changing the way Facebook makes its money,' notes Open Markets' Hubbard.On the day of the launch, Harris' office described it as a 'nine month collaboration between Attorney General Kamala Harris's office, major tech companies, law enforcement and victims' advocates.'For Harris, tech companies were part of the solution, not the problem. 'I cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,' she said during a press conference.It was hard to miss the different approaches Harris had taken with powerful political actors and small-time crooks. Bollaert got 18 years, while Google and Facebook got a private meeting and public praise. A Soft Touch And Big Checks Harris' initiative was not totally fruitless. 'Within a month of our task force launching, Google took action to de-index the names of people from their platform,' notes Citron \u2015 meaning the search engine would not direct queries for individual names to revenge porn sites. Butmany victims' advocates maintain[17] that Google is still a serious problem. Whatever its formal guidelines, the search engine lets a lot of harmful material slide. Facebook is even worse. In 2017, a nonprofit military journalism outlet reported[18] that veteran and active-duty Marines had been using Facebook to share nude photos of ex-girlfriends and strangers without their consent \u2015 including dozens of active-duty female servicemembers. Four years after its meeting with Harris in San Francisco, Facebook was still a breeding ground[19] for revenge porn.By 2017, Harris was no longer in state government. She was elected to the Senate in 2016, backed by roughly $214,000 in campaign contributions from Big Tech, including the maximum individual donation allowed under California law from Sandberg herself.Two days after the election, Sandberg wrote to congratulate Harris.Kamala,CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! We need you now more than ever.I just did a Facebook post about you and all the women.Cheering you on!SherylAs a top contender for Joe Biden's VP slot, Harris' record with Big Tech is more than a historical curiosity.For most of her tenure as California AG, Harris was aware that something was going wrong at the most powerful and profitable institutions in her state. But she chose not to pursue them, training her sights instead on bad actors who didn't carry political influence.Meanwhile, the tech giants matured into a grave threat to American democracy. Today, Facebook is not merely a hotbed for cruel sexual vendettas, but a vector for Russian propaganda, white nationalist organizing and even terrorism.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has developed a close relationship with Trump and is bending the platform to fit far-right proclivities. Sandberg has made a point of attending photo ops with Trump[20] and Vice President Mike Pence.As a senator, Harris has been mostly quiet on policy-making issues that carry implications for Facebook and Google. She sat out the debate on a 2018 sex trafficking bill \u2015 once her signature issue \u2015 only entering her name as a co-sponsor after it was clear the bill would pass by a wide margin.Last year, as other contenders for the 2020 presidential nomination called to break up Facebook and Google, Harris again suggested a lighter approach.'I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure and the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,' Harris told The New York Times[21] in January 2019. When pressed on whether that included break-ups, Harris dodged. 'My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.'For most tech experts, that approach is simply unrealistic.'All of the problems with Facebook all come down to two things,' notes Hubbard. 'Its business model and the fact that it's a monopoly power. You can't fix that with better privacy standards.'

Kamala Harris and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg talk at Facebook headquarters on Feb. 10, 2015, in Menlo Park, California. Harris delivered the keynote speech at the event.    Though it has been lost in the mists of other scandals, back in 2014, Facebook was in the middle of what was then the biggest public relations debacle in company history. That June, a Facebook data scientist and two academics released a paper demonstrating that users could be emotionally manipulated based on the information Facebook\u2019s engineers fed into their accounts.      The conclusions of the study were alarming. But even more shocking was the means by which researchers had reached them. Facebook had used 700,000 of its users as social science guinea pigs without their consent. Not only could Facebook manipulate its users; it  had manipulated them, without any regard to the ethical implications.   A firestorm of bad press and user fury ensued. Then, in December 2015, The Guardian reported that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had harvested \u201cpsychological data\u201d from millions of Facebook users for his presidential campaign, relying on a small firm known as Cambridge Analytica.   These were the days before Facebook had been weaponized to incite genocide in Myanmar or livestream mass shootings in New Zealand or proliferate the far-right propaganda that helped elect Donald Trump. But there were plenty of indications that something was amiss with the world\u2019s most popular social network \u2015 which was already under a November 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission requiring the company to take better care of user data and privacy.   At that time, Kamala Harris was the top state law enforcement official overseeing Facebook and every other major tech company in Silicon Valley. As attorney general of California, she possessed sweeping powers to restrain the growing power of those tech platforms.          Get the top stories emailed every day.

Privacy Policy          \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that attorneys general across the country could have done to rein in Big Tech,\u201d according to Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank. \u201cMost notably, challenging the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers.\u201d   Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from either an antitrust or a consumer protection perspective.  Those acquisitions took place in 2012 and 2014, during Harris\u2019 tenure as AG. And yet Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from an antitrust perspective, nor brought legal action against them on consumer protection grounds. Even well into her 2020 presidential campaign, she pursued a soft touch with Big Tech, issuing vague promises to secure consumer privacy protections as her rivals for the Democratic nomination \u2015 particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2015 vowed to break up Facebook and implement ambitious new regulatory regimes.   More than 1,400 pages of emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request help explain this inaction, showing that Harris generally viewed Big Tech as a partner rather than a threat. At times, she even teamed up with tech companies to market herself as a rising star in American politics \u2015 a depiction that proved correct with her election to the Senate in 2016.    Today, Harris is a leading contender for the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential nomination. One of the most pressing questions for the next administration will be how it chooses to grapple with the corporate behemoths that have come to dominate American culture. This look inside Harris\u2019 record with Big Tech suggests a politician who identifies with the tech elite and is wary of substantive reform.  Leaning In, Leaning Out  In February 2013, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote to Harris asking for a glossy photograph of the AG and a personal anecdote demonstrating how Harris had \u201cleaned in.\u201d Sandberg was looking for stories of powerful women proving their mettle in the male-dominated upper echelons of American power, from boardrooms to statehouses. As the top law enforcement official in the biggest state in the country, Harris was a natural target.   Sandberg was asking Harris to participate in a massive PR rollout for her soon-to-be-released book \u201dLean In.\u201d The \u201dLean In\u201d marketing campaign was intimately connected to Facebook itself. Ordinary women who wanted to follow the Lean In movement had to sign up through a Facebook account and \u201clike\u201d Lean In to receive further career advice.    Harris passed along a headshot and her own \u201cLean In\u201d story \u2015 a tale of how she got her start in electoral politics running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 as a long-shot upstart who defeated several well-connected male challengers.    Harris was far from the only public figure to join in the marketing splash. When Lean In  came out in March 2013, Sandberg\u2019s memoir was celebrated as a women\u2019s rights triumph \u2015 a road map to everything women could aspire to be in the corporate hierarchy. \u201cSandberg is not just tough,\u201d wrote Anne-Marie Slaughter in a glowing New York Times review. \u201cShe also comes across as compassionate, funny, honest and likable\u201d \u2015 everything an ambitious young woman could hope to be. Slaughter was a former State Department official about to be named head of the New America Foundation, a liberal think tank.    So nobody made a fuss about a state law enforcement official joining a PR push for a top official at a company she ostensibly policed. The idea that either Sandberg or her company represented any kind of public policy problem was beyond the scope of what most politicians considered political.   But there were rumblings that the platforms \u2015 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2015 were losing control of what they had created. In 2013, public fury began to mount over revenge porn, a practice in which men posted nude or compromising photos or videos of ex-girlfriends hoping to humiliate them. Revenge porn specialists were typically isolated grifters, but the tech giants gave them public reach. A website in a lonely corner of the internet wouldn\u2019t get much traffic if Google, Facebook and Twitter never directed anybody to it, or refused to host such images on their platforms.   As AG, Harris made revenge porn a signature issue, eventually broadening the scope of her crackdown to include all \u201ccyber exploitation\u201d \u2015 efforts to profit from abuse, particularly of women, online.     But she didn\u2019t go after the tech companies themselves. In 2013, she brought a case against Kevin Bollaert, the 27-year-old founder of UGotPosted.com,  a site that invited misogynists to post photos of their exes. Bollaert was also the founder of ChangeMyReputation.com, a site that charged people a fee to take down those damaging photos. It was a clever scam: letting bad actors post material without consent on one site and then forcing victims to pay him to take it down through another site.   Harris threw the book at Bollaert, who was eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison. For women\u2019s rights activists, it was a victory \u2015 free speech claims online didn\u2019t include efforts to humiliate people sexually without their consent.    \u201cShe took on cyber exploitation,\u201d says Danielle Citron, a law professor at Boston University who received a MacArthur Foundation \u201cGenius\u201d grant in 2019. \u201cNo other AG in the country did that.\u201d Citron is a vice president at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which has received funding from Facebook and Twitter.   Harris\u2019s arguments in the case explicitly shielded Silicon Valley from any potential implications of a guilty verdict. Bollaert was responsible for what happened on his site because he was a publisher, not a neutral platform.    But as it became increasingly impossible to ignore the role Big Tech was playing in the revenge porn problem, Harris sent company representatives a note on Jan. 9, 2015, inviting them to her San Francisco office for a Feb. 4 meeting. The emails don\u2019t indicate much about what occurred during that discussion, but six days later, Harris appeared onstage with Sandberg at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, smiling and waving to the crowd before giving a talk about cyberbullying.     Justin Sullivan via  Kamala Harris on stage at Facebook HQ with Sheryl Sandberg on Feb. 10, 2015.   The emails show that Harris convened private meetings for her cyber exploitation program throughout most of the year, finally launching the initiative as a public campaign in October of 2015. Tech companies committed to changing the way they monitored abusive content on their platforms. Harris praised their efforts in a June 2015 Marie Claire profile, which her office repeatedly emailed out to representatives from the firms over the months ahead of the October launch.   \u201cI asked some online companies to come in for a meeting about how we could create a safer environment online,\u201d Harris told Marie Claire . \u201cThey were wonderful. Many companies really want to lead on this issue.\u201d   According to a February 2019 Politico profile , Harris relied on an advocacy tactic known as \u201cinterest convergence theory,\u201d which maintains that activists have better success with reform projects when they align their goals with the interests of powerful institutions. Showing Facebook and Google that revenge porn was hurting their bottom line would help bring them along.   The problem with this reasoning is that in many cases, Big Tech directly profits from socially destructive policies.   \u201cRevenge porn, election integrity, the destruction of journalism \u2015 you can\u2019t fix any of these problems at Facebook without changing the way Facebook makes its money,\u201d notes Open Markets\u2019 Hubbard.   On the day of the launch, Harris\u2019 office described it as a \u201cnine month collaboration between Attorney General Kamala Harris\u2019s office, major tech companies, law enforcement and victims\u2019 advocates.\u201d    For Harris, tech companies were part of the solution, not the problem. \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,\u201d she said during a press conference.   It was hard to miss the different approaches Harris had taken with powerful political actors and small-time crooks. Bollaert got 18 years, while Google and Facebook got a private meeting and public praise.  A Soft Touch And Big Checks  Harris\u2019 initiative was not totally fruitless. \u201cWithin a month of our task force launching, Google took action to de-index the names of people from their platform,\u201d notes Citron \u2015 meaning the search engine would not direct queries for individual names to revenge porn sites.   But  many victims\u2019 advocates maintain that Google is still a serious problem. Whatever its formal guidelines, the search engine lets a lot of harmful material slide.   Facebook is even worse. In 2017, a nonprofit military journalism outlet reported that veteran and active-duty Marines had been using Facebook to share nude photos of ex-girlfriends and strangers without their consent \u2015 including dozens of active-duty female servicemembers. Four years after its meeting with Harris in San Francisco, Facebook was still a breeding ground for revenge porn.   By 2017, Harris was no longer in state government. She was elected to the Senate in 2016, backed by roughly $214,000 in campaign contributions from Big Tech, including the maximum individual donation allowed under California law from Sandberg herself.   Two days after the election, Sandberg wrote to congratulate Harris.    Kamala,   CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! We need you now more than ever.   I just did a Facebook post about you and all the women.   Cheering you on!   Sheryl   As a top contender for Joe Biden\u2019s VP slot, Harris\u2019 record with Big Tech is more than a historical curiosity.   For most of her tenure as California AG, Harris was aware that something was going wrong at the most powerful and profitable institutions in her state. But she chose not to pursue them, training her sights instead on bad actors who didn\u2019t carry political influence.   Meanwhile, the tech giants matured into a grave threat to American democracy. Today, Facebook is not merely a hotbed for cruel sexual vendettas, but a vector for Russian propaganda, white nationalist organizing and even terrorism.    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has developed a close relationship with Trump and is bending the platform to fit far-right proclivities. Sandberg has made a point of attending photo ops with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.   As a senator, Harris has been mostly quiet on policy-making issues that carry implications for Facebook and Google. She sat out the debate on a 2018 sex trafficking bill \u2015 once her signature issue \u2015 only entering her name as a co-sponsor after it was clear the bill would pass by a wide margin.    Last year, as other contenders for the 2020 presidential nomination called to break up Facebook and Google, Harris again suggested a lighter approach.   \u201cI believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure and the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,\u201d Harris told The New York Times in January 2019.     When pressed on whether that included break-ups, Harris dodged. \u201cMy first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.\u201d    For most tech experts, that approach is simply unrealistic.   \u201cAll of the problems with Facebook all come down to two things,\u201d notes Hubbard. \u201cIts business model and the fact that it\u2019s a monopoly power. You can\u2019t fix that with better privacy standards alone.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42623063188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CN-C491-JCSC-J32X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Huffington Post Canada</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JCMDA3OEMzRjM2NDJGRkIwQUFCNEFCMEM2QzFCRDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzIzQjhEQkQ0QkYxNDkzMEEyMjhGMEFBNUUxNTNERDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Kamala Harris and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg talk at Facebook headquarters on Feb. 10, 2015, in Menlo Park, California. Harris delivered the keynote speech at the event. (Photo: Justin Sullivan via )Though it has been lost in the mists of other scandals, back in 2014, Facebook was in the middle of what was then the biggest public relations debacle in company history. That June, a Facebook data scientist and two academics released a paper demonstrating that s could be emotionally manipulated based on the information Facebook\u2019s engineers fed into their accounts. The conclusions of the study were alarming. But even more shocking was the means by which researchers reached them. Facebook had used 700,000 of its s as social science guinea pigs without their consent. Not only could Facebook manipulate its s; it had manipulated them, without any regard to the ethical implications.A firestorm of bad press and ensued. Then, in December 2015, The Guardian reported that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had harvested \u201cpsychological data\u201d from millions of Facebook s for his presidential campaign, relying on a small firm known as Cambridge Analytica that specialized in helping elect right-wing politicians.These were the days before Facebook had been weaponized to incite genocide in Myanmar or livestream mass shootings in New Zealand or proliferate the far-right propaganda that helped elect Donald Trump. But there were plenty of indications that something was amiss with the world\u2019s most popular social network \u2015 which was already under a November 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission requiring the company to take better care of data and privacy.At that time, Kamala Harris was the top state law enforcement official overseeing Facebook and every other major tech company in Silicon Valley. As attorney general of California, she possessed sweeping powers to rein in tech platforms.   \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that attorneys general across the country could have done to rein in Big Tech,\u201d according to Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank. \u201cMost notably, challenging the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers.\u201d   Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from either an antitrust or a consumer protection perspective. Those deals, from 2012 and 2014, took place during Harris\u2019 tenure. And yet Harris, like federal regulators in the Obama administration, never confronted these metastasizing threats to American democracy from either an antitrust or a consumer protection perspective. Even well into her 2020 presidential campaign, she pursued a soft touch with Big Tech, issuing vague promises to secure consumer privacy protections as her rivals for the Democratic nomination \u2015 most notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2015 vowed to break up Facebook and implement ambitious new regulatory regimes. than 1,400 pages of emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request help explain this inaction, showing that Harris generally viewed Big Tech as a partner rather than a threat. At times, she even teamed up with tech companies to market herself as a rising star in American politics \u2015 a depiction that proved correct with her election to the Senate in 2016.   Today, Harris is a leading contender for the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential nomination. One of the most pressing questions for the next administration will be how it chooses to grapple with the corporate behemoths that have come to dominate American life and culture. This look inside Harris\u2019 record with Big Tech suggests a politician eager to make friends in the tech elite and uninterested in substantive reform.Leaning In, Leaning Out  In February 2013, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote to Harris asking for a glossy photograph of the AG and a personal story demonstrating how Harris had \u201cleaned in.\u201d Sandberg was looking for stories of powerful women proving their mettle in the male-dominated upper echelons of American power, from boardrooms to statehouses. As the top law enforcement official in the biggest state in the country, Harris was a natural choice.Sandberg asked Harris to participate in a massive PR rollout for her soon-to-be-released book \u201dLean In.\u201d When it came out in March 2013, Sandberg\u2019s memoir was celebrated as a women\u2019s rights triumph \u2015 a road map to everything women could aspire to be in the corporate hierarchy. The \u201dLean In\u201d marketing campaign was intimately connected to Facebook itself. Ordinary women who wanted to follow the Lean In movement had to sign up through a Facebook account and \u201clike\u201d Lean In to receive further career advice. Harris passed along a headshot and her own \u201cLean In\u201d story \u2015 a tale of how she got her start in electoral politics running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003 as a long-shot upstart who defeated several male challengers. Harris was far from the only public figure to join in the marketing splash. In 2013, Sandberg was an aspirational feminist hero, and millions of professional women drew inspiration from the message of her book. \u201cSandberg is not just tough,\u201d wrote Anne-Marie Slaughter in a glowing New York Times review. \u201cShe also comes across as compassionate, funny, honest and likable\u201d \u2015 everything an ambitious young woman could hope to be. Slaughter was a former State Department official about to be named head of the New America Foundation, a liberal think tank.   So nobody made a fuss about a state law enforcement official joining a PR push for a top official at a company she ostensibly policed. The idea that either Sandberg or her company represented any kind of public policy problem was beyond the scope of what most politicians considered political.  But there were rumblings that the platforms \u2015 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2015 were losing control of what they had created. In 2013, public began to mount over revenge porn, a practice in which men posted nude or compromising photos or videos of ex-girlfriends on the internet hoping to humiliate them. These were actions devised by small-time grifters, but the tech giants gave them public reach. A website in a lonely corner of the internet wouldn\u2019t get much traffic if Google, Facebook and Twitter never directed anybody to it, or refused to host such images on their platforms.  As AG, Harris made revenge porn a signature issue, eventually broadening the scope of her crackdown to include all \u201ccyber exploitation\u201d \u2015 efforts to profit from abuse, particularly of women, online.   But she didn\u2019t go after the tech companies themselves. In 2013, she brought a case against Kevin Bollaert, the 27-year-old founder of UGotPosted.com, a site where vengeful people could post photos of their exes. Bollaert was also the founder of ChangeMyReputation.com, a site that charged people a fee to take down those compromising photos. It was a clever scam: letting bad actors post material without consent on one site and then forcing victims to pay him to take it down.  Harris threw the book at Bollaert, who was eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison. For women\u2019s rights activists, it was a victory \u2015 free speech claims online didn\u2019t include efforts to humiliate people sexually without their consent.   But Harris\u2019s arguments in the case explicitly shielded Silicon Valley from any implications. Bollaert was responsible for what happened on his site because he was a publisher, not a neutral platform. Companies like Facebook had different legal protections.As it became increasingly impossible to ignore the role Big Tech was playing in the revenge porn problem, Harris sent company representatives a note on Jan. 9, 2015, inviting them to her San Francisco office for a Feb. 4 meeting. The emails don\u2019t indicate much about what occurred during that discussion, but four days later, Harris appeared onstage with Sandberg at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, smiling and waving to the crowd before giving a talk about cyberbullying.  Harris was aware that something was going wrong at the most powerful and profitable institutions in her state. But she chose not to confront them, instead focusing on small-time players who didn\u2019t carry political influence, while the tech giants matured into one of the gravest threats to American democracy. The emails show that Harris convened private meetings for her cyber exploitation program throughout most of the year, finally launching the initiative as a public campaign in October of 2015. Tech companies committed to changing the way they monitored abusive content on their platforms. Harris praised their efforts in a June 2015 Marie Claire profile, which her office repeatedly emailed out to representatives from the firms over the months ahead of the October launch.\u201cI asked some online companies to come in for a meeting about how we could create a safer environment online,\u201d Harris told Marie Claire. \u201cThey were wonderful. Many companies really want to lead on this issue because this is the reality of innovation: You create something new that has incredible benefits, but then you see there\u2019s another side. We want to minimize, if not eliminate, the harm that can come as a result.\u201dAccording to a February 2019 Politico profile, Harris relied on an advocacy tactic known as \u201cinterest convergence theory,\u201d which maintains that activists have better success with their projects when they can be aligned with the interests of other powerful institutions. Showing Facebook and Google that revenge porn was hurting their bottom line would help bring them along. The problem with this reasoning is that in many cases, the reason Big Tech supports socially destructive policies is precisely because they are profitable.\u201cRevenge porn, election integrity, the destruction of journalism \u2015 you can\u2019t fix any of these problems at Facebook without changing the way Facebook makes its money,\u201d notes Open Markets\u2019 Hubbard.On the day of the launch, Harris\u2019 office described it as a \u201cnine month collaboration between Attorney General Kamala Harris\u2019s office, major tech companies, law enforcement and victims\u2019 advocates.\u201d For Harris, tech companies were part of the solution, not the problem. \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,\u201d she said during a press conference.It was hard to miss the different approach Harris had taken with powerful political actors and small-time crooks. Bollaert got 18 years, while Google and Facebook got a meeting and public praise.A Soft Touch And Big ChecksOf course, that soft touch didn\u2019t accomplish much. In 2017, a nonprofit military journalism outlet reported that veteran and active-duty Marines had been using Facebook to share nude photos of ex-girlfriends and strangers without their consent \u2015 including dozens of active-duty female servicemembers. Four years after its meeting with Harris in San Francisco, Facebook remained a breeding ground for revenge porn.But by 2017, Harris was no longer in state government. She was elected to the Senate in 2016, backed by roughly $214,000 in campaign contributions from Big Tech, including the maximum individual donation allowed under California law from Sandberg herself.Two days after the election, Sandberg wrote to congratulate Harris.   Kamala,  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!! We need you now more than ever.  I just did a Facebook post about you and all the women.  Cheering you on!  Sheryl  Three years later, Harris is a top contender for Joe Biden\u2019s VP slot after a jumbled presidential run of her own, making her record with Big Tech and what it reveals about her judgment more than a historical curiosity. Harris was aware that something was going wrong at the most powerful and profitable institutions in her state. But she chose not to confront them, instead focusing on small-time players who didn\u2019t carry political influence, while the tech giants matured into one of the gravest threats to American democracy, a vector for Russian propaganda, white nationalist organizing and even terrorism. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has developed a close relationship with Trump and is bending the platform to fit far-right proclivities. Sandberg has made a point of attending photo ops with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.As a senator, Harris has been mostly quiet on policy-making issues with implications for Facebook and Google. She sat out the debate on a 2018 sex trafficking bill \u2015 once her signature issue \u2015 only entering her name as a co-sponsor after it was clear the bill would pass by a wide margin, fearing a backlash from Big Tech. Last year, as other contenders for the 2020 presidential nomination called to break up Facebook and Google, Harris again suggested a lighter approach.\u201cI believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way that we can ensure and the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised,\u201d Harris told The New York Times in January 2019. When pressed on whether that included break-ups, Harris dodged. \u201cMy first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.\u201d \u201cAll of the problems with Facebook all come down to two things,\u201d notes Hubbard. \u201cIts business model and the fact that it\u2019s a monopoly power. You can\u2019t fix that with better privacy standards.\u201d|This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42620101412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CH-V231-F07F-80XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

Google's Content ID for YouTube cost a reported (EURO)100 million to build and run, and it only does a fraction of the blocking required under Article 13. That means that they'll have to buy filter services from someone else.</p><p>'The most likely filter vendors are the US Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook, who will have to build and run filters anyway, and could recoup their costs by renting access to these filters to smaller competitors.'</p><p>Cory Doctorow, a leading campaigner for copyright reform, explained: 'So Article 13 guarantees America's giant companies a permanent share of all small EU companies' revenues and access to an incredibly valuable data-stream generated by all European discourse, conversation, and expression.</p><p>'These companies have a long track record of capitalising on users' personal data to their advantage, and between that advantage and the revenues they siphon off of their small European competitors, they are likely to gain permanent dominance over Europe's Internet.' </p><p>Nineteen countries endorsed the revamp which hasn't been updated in almost two decades - before the birth of YouTube or Facebook.</p><p>EU countries adopted the reforms that were agreed last month by the European Parliament, they said in a statement.</p><p>'The new rules ensure adequate protection for authors and artists, while opening up new possibilities for accessing and sharing copyright-protected content online throughout the European Union,' they said. </p><p>An EU source said Italy, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Poland voted against the controversial legislation. </p><p>What are the key issues to the revamped copyright reform? </p><p>WHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE SAY?</p><p>The most vigorously debated part of the legislation is a section that makes companies responsible for making sure that copyrighted material isn't uploaded to their platforms without permission from the original creator. </p><p>It puts the legal onus on platforms to prevent copyright infringement but critics say it will end up having a chilling effect on freedom of expression on the internet and could result in censorship.</p><p>Another section of the bill that caused concern requires search engines and social media sites to pay for linking to or offering up snippets of news articles. </p><p>HOW WILL IT AFFECT INTERNET PLATFORMS?</p><p>Some sites would be forced to license music or videos. If not, sites would have to make sure they don't have unauthorized copyrighted material. </p><p>Critics worry that could lead to costly automatic filtering. And paying for links could create further costs.</p><p>That could give tech giants an edge over smaller companies. Google said last year it spent more than $100 million on Content ID, its copyright management system for approved users on YouTube, where more than 400 hours of content is uploaded every minute. The figure includes both staffing and computing resources. </p><p>HOW WILL IT SHAPE INTERNET CONTENT?</p><p>Critics say it could act as censorship and change internet culture.</p><p>They say the automatic filters are blunt instruments, deleting some material that should be allowed online. </p><p>YouTube has warned of unintended consequences, saying that in cases where copyright is uncertain, it would have to block videos to avoid liability.</p><p>Some consumers worry that the new rules would bring an end to parodies and viral internet 'memes' that have powered online culture and are often based on or inspired by existing songs or movies or other content. The EU denies this.</p><p>'Despite recent improvements, the EU Directive falls short of creating a balanced and modern framework for copyright,' Maud Sacquet, senior policy manager at the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a lobby group. </p><p>'We fear it will harm online innovation and restrict online freedoms in Europe.' </p><p>WILL IT HELP CONTENT CREATORS?</p><p>It depends on whom you ask. The music industry and other groups that collect royalties say the directive will help give writers, artists and creators more protection of their rights and incomes, by requiring tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google to pay them more for their work.</p><p>Some authors and artists fear they won't earn significantly more money but their creativity will be stifled. </p><p>Google estimates it has paid out more than $3 billion to rights holders through its Content ID system, which was created in 2007. </p><p>HOW HAVE PEOPLE REACTED?</p><p>Some high profile artists have spoken out in favor. Former Beatles member Paul McCartney wrote an open letter to EU lawmakers encouraging them to adopt the new rules.</p><p>But many appear worried it will change the internet as we know it. More than 5.2 million people signed an online petition against the directive. </p><p>Internet luminaries such as Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales have spoken out against it. </p><p>So has the former frontman for the band Fugees, Wyclef Jean, who has said he is better off financially because fans can freely share his music on internet platforms.</p><p>Last month, tens of thousands of people marched in cities across Germany to protest against the directive. </p><p>Wikipedia's German-language page was temporarily blacked out in protest and visitors were greeted with a statement from online encyclopedia authors urging them to ask their EU lawmakers to stop the bill. </p><p>Poland's leader has said his country will not implement the directive, arguing it threatens freedom of speech. </p><p>WHAT'S NEXT?</p><p>The EU's member countries have two years to comply with the directive by drafting their own national laws. </p><p>Six countries - Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - voted against it, so implementation is likely to be uneven, setting the stage for legal challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52890213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWT-9671-JCJY-G1M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1207\"/><timeReceived>2:18 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Google's Content ID for YouTube cost a reported (EURO)100 million to build and run, and it only does a fraction of the blocking required under Article 13. That means that they'll have to buy filter services from someone else.</p><p>'The most likely filter vendors are the US Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook, who will have to build and run filters anyway, and could recoup their costs by renting access to these filters to smaller competitors.'</p><p>Cory Doctorow, a leading campaigner for copyright reform, explained: 'So Article 13 guarantees America's giant companies a permanent share of all small EU companies' revenues and access to an incredibly valuable data-stream generated by all European discourse, conversation, and expression.</p><p>'These companies have a long track record of capitalising on users' personal data to their advantage, and between that advantage and the revenues they siphon off of their small European competitors, they are likely to gain permanent dominance over Europe's Internet.' </p><p>Nineteen countries endorsed the revamp which hasn't been updated in almost two decades - before the birth of YouTube or Facebook.</p><p>EU countries adopted the reforms that were agreed last month by the European Parliament, they said in a statement.</p><p>'The new rules ensure adequate protection for authors and artists, while opening up new possibilities for accessing and sharing copyright-protected content online throughout the European Union,' they said. </p><p>An EU source said Italy, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Poland voted against the controversial legislation. </p><p>What are the key issues to the revamped copyright reform? </p><p>WHAT DOES THE DIRECTIVE SAY?</p><p>The most vigorously debated part of the legislation is a section that makes companies responsible for making sure that copyrighted material isn't uploaded to their platforms without permission from the original creator. </p><p>It puts the legal onus on platforms to prevent copyright infringement but critics say it will end up having a chilling effect on freedom of expression on the internet and could result in censorship.</p><p>Another section of the bill that caused concern requires search engines and social media sites to pay for linking to or offering up snippets of news articles. </p><p>HOW WILL IT AFFECT INTERNET PLATFORMS?</p><p>Some sites would be forced to license music or videos. If not, sites would have to make sure they don't have unauthorized copyrighted material. </p><p>Critics worry that could lead to costly automatic filtering. And paying for links could create further costs.</p><p>That could give tech giants an edge over smaller companies. Google said last year it spent more than $100 million on Content ID, its copyright management system for approved users on YouTube, where more than 400 hours of content is uploaded every minute. The figure includes both staffing and computing resources. </p><p>HOW WILL IT SHAPE INTERNET CONTENT?</p><p>Critics say it could act as censorship and change internet culture.</p><p>They say the automatic filters are blunt instruments, deleting some material that should be allowed online. </p><p>YouTube has warned of unintended consequences, saying that in cases where copyright is uncertain, it would have to block videos to avoid liability.</p><p>Some consumers worry that the new rules would bring an end to parodies and viral internet 'memes' that have powered online culture and are often based on or inspired by existing songs or movies or other content. The EU denies this.</p><p>'Despite recent improvements, the EU Directive falls short of creating a balanced and modern framework for copyright,' Maud Sacquet, senior policy manager at the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a lobby group. </p><p>'We fear it will harm online innovation and restrict online freedoms in Europe.' </p><p>WILL IT HELP CONTENT CREATORS?</p><p>It depends on whom you ask. The music industry and other groups that collect royalties say the directive will help give writers, artists and creators more protection of their rights and incomes, by requiring tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google to pay them more for their work.</p><p>Some authors and artists fear they won't earn significantly more money but their creativity will be stifled. </p><p>Google estimates it has paid out more than $3 billion to rights holders through its Content ID system, which was created in 2007. </p><p>HOW HAVE PEOPLE REACTED?</p><p>Some high profile artists have spoken out in favor. Former Beatles member Paul McCartney wrote an open letter to EU lawmakers encouraging them to adopt the new rules.</p><p>But many appear worried it will change the internet as we know it. More than 5.2 million people signed an online petition against the directive. </p><p>Internet luminaries such as Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales have spoken out against it. </p><p>So has the former frontman for the band Fugees, Wyclef Jean, who has said he is better off financially because fans can freely share his music on internet platforms.</p><p>Last month, tens of thousands of people marched in cities across Germany to protest against the directive. </p><p>Wikipedia's German-language page was temporarily blacked out in protest and visitors were greeted with a statement from online encyclopedia authors urging them to ask their EU lawmakers to stop the bill. </p><p>Poland's leader has said his country will not implement the directive, arguing it threatens freedom of speech. </p><p>WHAT'S NEXT?</p><p>The EU's member countries have two years to comply with the directive by drafting their own national laws. </p><p>Six countries - Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - voted against it, so implementation is likely to be uneven, setting the stage for legal challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52890213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWW-V5J1-F021-61YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1207\"/><timeReceived>2:18 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

I'm excited to bring you this new weekly video featuring our Sovereign Investor Daily experts. Each Saturday, you'll be able to watch our experts debate the latest market trends and financial news \u2014 while revealing the best ways for you to profit. In today's first Market Insights, Jeff Yastine, Ted Bauman and Ian King discuss: The trade war: Why the impacts of the U.S.-China trade war are being overestimated \u2014 and what this means for the market. Quote: 'I don't think it's going to have that much impact, unless there's an entire drain of money out of the stock market a bear market.' Interest rates: Whether or not the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2019, and how to prepare your portfolio. Quote: 'As long as the Fed is accommodative, there is no alternative to stocks.' Antitrust news: What potential antitrust legislation means for Big Tech. Quote: 'I do think there is upside to having a monopoly in certain areas of society.' </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC4-5O6mYjA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC4-5O6mYjA</url>[1]Don't Fear the Trade WarThe U.S.-China trade war dominated headlines in May. As investors panicked, the S...00 Index dropped 6.6% for the month, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell over 10% into correction territory. But in today's Market Insights video, Jeff, Ted and Ian explain that trade with China makes up less than 1% of the U.S. economy. That means many stocks have unfairly gotten swept up in trade war fears despite being great companies with solid fundamentals. And that presents some great opportunities. Some of these companies are in Jeff's Total Wealth Insider [2]and Ted's Bauman Letter [3]services. Once the market bounces back \u2014 like we've already begun to see this past week \u2014 the strongest companies will quickly make up lost ground and soar to new highs. Our experts also talk about: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made an important announcement on Tuesday. Ian explains how the markets are reacting to the news. Antitrust regulations threaten Amazon, Google and the other tech titans. Find out what this means for the U.S. economy and the tech industry in the years ahead. Are there any particular topics you'd like to see our experts address in future Market Insights? If so, you can send your requests to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:SovereignInvestor@banyanhill.com[4]\">SovereignInvestor@banyanhill.com[4]</email>; I hope you enjoyed this new addition to Sovereign Investor Daily. Be sure to tune in next Saturday for our next episode. And remember to read below for a wrap-up of this week's Sovereign Investor Daily articles. We discussed some great topics, such as e-commerce and investing techniques, this week.

It is a bet that the app can introduce a new generation of users to the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s ever-expanding social media universe.</p><p>In doing so, Facebook immediately reignited a furious debate about how young is too young for children to use mobile apps and how parents should deal with the steady creep of technology into family life, especially as some fight to reduce the amount of time their sons and daughters spend in front of screens. On one side are parents like Matt Quirion of Washington, who said Facebook\u2019s snaking its way into his children\u2019s lives at an early age would most likely do more harm than good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an avid social media user, but I don\u2019t feel my kids need more social interaction,\u201d said Mr. Quirion, 39, whose three children are between ages 3 and 9. \u201cThey need their personal time to process all the social interaction and learn to grow into mature people.\u201d</p><p>Just as vocal are parents like Parker Thompson of Alameda, Calif., who said children\u2019s adoption of technology is an inevitability and who appreciated Facebook\u2019s approach with the new app.</p><p>\u201cToday, much of the time our options come down to giving kids devices and trusting things will work out, watching them closely at all times, or banning technology,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, 38, a father of three children between 6 months to 8 years old. \u201cTech is going to be something kids adopt. The question is how this will happen.\u201d</p><p>Facebook\u2019s official entry into the children\u2019s market is a watershed moment both for families and for the social network. Preteens and teenagers already flock to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms\">YouTube</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511\">Instagram</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.snap.com/en-US/terms/\">Snapchat</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.musical.ly/en-US/term\">Musical.ly</url>, general interest sites whose policies state that they are not for use by children under 13. Preteens are also avid senders of text messages.</p><p>But only a handful of messaging and social apps \u2014 like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kudos.com/terms-conditions/\">Kudos, a photo-sharing app</url> \u2014 are designed for younger children to use with parental permission and supervision. That\u2019s because of a federal law, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa, which requires services aimed at children to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child under 13 \u2014 like photos, videos, voice recordings, location, contact information and names.</p><p>Until this year, even big tech companies had been loath to set up children\u2019s sites with a parental consent system lest they violate the law. In 2011, for example, an operator of virtual worlds that had been acquired by the Walt Disney Company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/05/operators-online-virtual-worlds-pay-3-million-settle-ftc-charges\">agreed to pay $3 million</url> to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it illegally collected and disclosed personal information from children under 13 without parents\u2019 consent.</p><p>Facebook said the point of Messenger Kids was to provide a more controlled environment for the types of activity that were already occurring across smartphones and tablets among family members. The company said it had spent months talking to parenting groups, child behavioral experts and safety organizations to aid in developing the app, as well as thousands of hours interviewing families on the ways that members communicate with one another. The app is <url normalizedValue=\"https://m.facebook.com/help/118909212153483\">compliant with Coppa</url>, it added.</p><p>\u201cRight now for kids, the time they spend on devices is very passive,\u201d said David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a device that helps you connect with others close to them.\u201d</p><p>Messenger Kids is built so that children do not sign up for new Facebook accounts themselves; Facebook\u2019s terms of service require that users be 13 or older. The app requires an adult with a Facebook account to set up the app for his or her child. After adults enter their Facebook account information into the app, they are asked to create the child\u2019s profile and which friends or relatives he or she will be allowed to connect with on Messenger. Every additional friend request requires approval by the parent.</p><p>The app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos. As with Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, children can add filters or playful drawings to the photos they send.</p><p>Loren Cheng, product director for Messenger Kids, said Facebook would not use for marketing purposes the details it collected from children. He also said the company would not automatically convert children\u2019s accounts to adult accounts when they turned 13.</p><p>The app, which will be in a preview release on Apple\u2019s iOS devices before rolling out to a wider audience in the coming months, is Facebook\u2019s latest effort to increase the number of people who rely on its service to connect with one another regularly. More than two billion people use Facebook every month, while its other apps, like Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, also have billions of users.</p><p>If Messenger Kids proves popular, Facebook may reap many benefits. The company could see increased messaging activity and more engaged, regularly returning users, not to mention insights and data on how families interact on Messenger.</p><p>Some children\u2019s and privacy groups commended Facebook for saying that Messenger Kids would give parents control over children\u2019s messaging and not show ads to children. But they also described Messenger Kids as a marketing effort to increase consumer loyalty.</p><p>\u201cThis is an attempt to create a feature that will help Facebook win over young people and keep their parents tied to the site,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democraticmedia.org/projects/focus/youth-digital-marketing\">the Center for Digital Democracy</url>, a privacy and children\u2019s advocacy group in Washington. \u201cWith       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html\">YouTube monetizing the youngest children</url>, it\u2019s too lucrative a market for Facebook to overlook \u2014 plus the company is losing youth market share to Snapchat.\u201d</p><p>Others cautioned that the app raised concerns about children\u2019s privacy.</p><p>According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://m.facebook.com/help/118909212153483\">Messenger Kids\u2019 privacy policy</url>, the app collects registration details from parents such as children\u2019s full names. It also collects the texts, audio and videos children send, as well as information about whom the child interacts with on the service, what features they use and how long the children use them.</p><p>The privacy policy also says that \u201cMessenger Kids is part of Facebook\u201d and that the company may share information collected in the app with other Facebook services. While parents can delete their children\u2019s Messenger Kids accounts, the policy says, the messages and content that a child sent to and received from others \u201cmay remain visible to those users.\u201d</p><p>James Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a children\u2019s media ratings and advocacy group, said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/technology/facebook-european-union-fine-whatsapp.html\">European regulators</url> had previously fined Facebook for reneging on privacy commitments. Given that history, he suggested that Facebook make a public and permanent commitment to keeping Messenger Kids free of advertising and to not using the app to prime children for grown-up accounts later.</p><p>\u201cWhy should parents simply trust that Facebook is acting in the best interest of children?\u201d Mr. Steyer asked.</p><p>Facebook can ill afford more controversies. The company has been in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/facebook-google-twitter-russian-interference-hearings.html\">cross hairs of C</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/facebook-google-twitter-russian-interference-hearings.html\">ongress</url> over the role it played in the 2016 presidential election, with the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/technology/facebook-russia-ads-.html\">spread of fake news and divisive content</url> on all of its platforms. The company has said more than 150 million people across Facebook and Instagram could have seen content linked to Russian agencies.</p><p>Still, the company said that issue was largely separate from Messenger. Facebook said its overall mission remained centered on bringing the world closer together.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let the current state of things prevent us from doing our jobs, which is to solve real problems in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Marcus, the head of Messenger at Facebook, said.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not weigh in on the start of Messenger Kids. Over the weekend, Mr. Zuckerberg, whose second child was born over the summer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10104263612872421&amp;set=a.529237706231.2034669.4&amp;type=3\">posted on Facebook</url> that he was going on paternity leave.</p><p>Follow Mike Isaac and Natasha Singer on Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac\">@MikeIsaac</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/natashanyt\">@natashanyt</url>.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac\"/></p><p>Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Natasha Singer from New York.</p><p>PHOTO: Facebook\u2019s Messenger Kids app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Derrick Broze via ConsciousResistance.com,[3] As the push towards 5G-powered 'Smart' surveillance cities begins across the United States the Federal Communications Commission has approved a new rule limiting the power of local authorities.  On Monday October 1st, Sacramento, Houston, Indianapolis and Los Angeles became the first cities to gain access to Verizon's 5G Wireless service. The City of Sacramento has become a focus of Verizon's nationwide expansion of 5G, or 5th Generation Cellular technology. 'We were able to make Sacramento one of our first 5G cities because Mayor Darrell Steinberg and city leaders embraced innovation and developed a strategic vision for how 5G could be a platform for the larger Sacramento technology ecosystem,'said[4]Jonathan LeCompte, Pacific Market president for Verizon. </p><p>The rollout of 5G is expected to herald the beginning of Smart Cities, where driverless cars, pollution sensors, cell phones, traffic lights, and thousands of other devices interact in what is known as'The Internet of Things'[5]. The move towards the smart grid was hastened last week when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a rule that will limit the role of local authorities regarding the build of 5G networks, specifically the amount city officials can charge telecommunication companies ('Big Tech'). The Hillreported[6]on the new rule: 'All four commissioners offered support for the rule, with Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel dissenting over only part of the proposal. When the new rules take effect, local officials will have 60 to 90 days to review installation requests.  Republicans on the commission say that limiting what they see as exorbitant fees in major cities will free up capital for companies like Verizon and AT...o invest in building out their networks in underserved rural areas. The commission estimated that the rule will save wireless providers $2 billion.'  However, there are those who are resisting the race towards the 'smart' future. Themayors of Los Angeles and Philadelphia opposed the rule[7]and accused the FCC of overriding local authority to regulate the new technology. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcettisent a letter[8]to the FCC stating that the rules would override previous agreements established by local authorities and Verizon and AT...In addition, before the vote a group of House Democratswrote[9]to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai asking him to cancel the vote. 'This is extraordinary federal overreach,' Rosenworcel said of the rule. 'I do not believe the law permits Washington to run roughshod over state and local authority like this and I worry the litigation that follows will only slow our 5G future.'The Hill also notes that critics argue that the rush to a 5G future is leading to an increased 'digital divide' between those who have faster internet abilities and those who do not.   Sascha Meinrath,the Palmer Chair in Telecommunications for Pennsylvania State University, believes the rule will contribute to decreased competition. 'What's preventing deployment is not permitting fees from local governments, its anti-competitive behavior from the incumbents,'hetold InsideSources in an interview[10]. 'If you study telecom history, this is a cycle that happens again and again and again.' Is 5G safe? Other concerns of the 5G expansion include potential health risks due to the need for an increase in cellular equipment. 5G technology is reported to be 100 times faster than current speeds but the signal is short so cities must install thousands of new 'small cells' on current infrastructure, as well as new equipment. Critics worry about the health impact of these cells.GovTechreports[11]: 'Additionally, the proliferation of small cells has prompted worries over potential health risks, particularly given how close some pole-mounted antennas are to homes. The FCC last updated its radiation exposure guidelines more than two decades ago, based mostly on existing cellphone towers. Citizens in several communities have protested installations, and the agency is in the process of updating its standards.'  The Vergealso reported[12]that the 'FCC excludes these small cell citesfrom being reviewed[13]for environmental impacts and impacts on the historical character of an area. It also limits review on tribal lands.' Health concerns regarding the dangers of cell phones and 5G have been prompted by a May 2011 assessment in which the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified cell phones as Category 2B for 'possibly carcinogenic to humans'. In addition, in August 2016, the LA Times asked,'Is 5G technology dangerous? Early data shows a slight increase of tumors in male rats exposed to cellphone radiation'[14]. That report shows that National Toxicology Program researchers released preliminary data in May 2016 which showed small increases in tumors in male rats exposed to cellphone radiation. The rats were exposed to nine hours of radiation daily, in 10-minutes-on, 10-minutes-off intervals, over their whole bodies for two years. The researchers found increased incidences of rare brain and heart tumors starting at about the federally allowable level of cellphone radiation for brain exposure, with greater incidences at about two and four times those levels.  Privacy, a Thing of the Past The coming Smart Grid also threatens to wipe away the last vestiges of privacy - all in the name of convenience, novelty, and (allegedly) safety. However, the dangers are largely being ignored in favor of touting the perceived benefits.The ACLU described[15]the surveillance dangers of 5G technology: 'Many of these technologies involvecameras[16]that can be tasked with jobs that range from keeping track of traffic to monitoring when the corner trash can gets full. The problems start when they're also used for tracking people and their movements. In a city blanketed with cameras \u2014 including inLED light bulbs[17]found in streetlights \u2014 it would be very easy for the government to track which political meetings, religious institutions, doctors offices, and other sensitive locations people go toand to focus its attention even more on traditionally over-policed communities. This is why these 'Smart Cities' are also referred to as 'Surveillance Cities[18].'  The FCC and city officials must conduct further studies on the potential health effects related to the roll out of 5G. Also, the people of these cities must have a chance to comment on the health and privacy implications. Unfortunately, it seems most people are either totally in the dark about this situation or welcoming 5G because of the prospect of 'living in the future now.'

To get a better understanding of some of the film's main points I highly recommend watching the trailer[2] (I appear about a minute and 5 seconds into it). Since 2009, I have been blogging about many of the troubling free speech and privacy issues inherent in the Social Media Age. During this time, I have also battled Facebook and Google (and their allies) in state legislatures and in Congress when it comes to enacting stronger privacy laws. Google and Facebook regularly lie to state and federal lawmakers and regulators. </p><p>That is not fake news or alternative facts but a fact. For example, Google has been fined 500 million dollars for illegal pharma ads[3] and tens of millions for lying about its privacy practices[4]. Over the years, I have watched Google intentionally hide various search results where I shine the light on their practices. For example, this opinion piece I wrote in the Delaware State News[5] about how Facebook and Google are intentionally trying to harm our kids by weakening stronger student privacy bills is very difficult to find online because Google is intentionally trying to bury it so others can't find it. Facebook has targeted me since 2010 when I wrote this blog post[6] outing their Disney Tickets together application as inherently dangerous. Soon after I wrote it, multiple people from Facebook's government affairs and pr team reached out to me to try to 'educate' me about Facebook. I refused to drink their cool aid. For years, I have continued to shine the light on Facebook's unethical and illegal behavior[7] especially when it comes to how they treat our kids. Facebook has consistently lied to the world about its privacy and data use practices. For example, the FTC has concluded that it intentionally misleads the public[8] about its data privacy and usage practices. Social Media companies are not only misleading the public about how our personal information is being utilized against us, they are also actively trying to social engineer society via search results people see when using their platforms. For example, the term 'most relevant' search results is code for the voices Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Sergey Brin (Google), Larry Paige (Google), and Jack Dorsey (Twitter) like. It doesn't mean what we want to see, it means what Silicon Valley wants us to see. These companies have proven time and again they will elevate voices in search results they agree with and they will silence voices they don't like. Twitter's CEO has even admitted to his company's left leaning bias[9]and Google's co-founder Sergey Brin and other top executives[10] were recently proven to be politically biased in a leaked internal video that was taped right after the 2016 Presidential election. Data discrimination based upon massive unfettered access to our personal information and algorithmic discrimination is a major threat to our democracy and the fabric of our life. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sued Facebook[11] for violating the Fair Housing Act because Facebook allows its customers to discriminate based upon race, sex, religion, and disability. In other words, Facebook enables its clients to weaponize its users' personal information against them. The Creepy Line does a great job of informing the American public about these troubling social engineering issues.Its not left vs. right, but the right for us to personally determine our future vs. the right for a small number of people based in Silicon Valley to decide who is heard and who is silenced and who succeeds and who fails. If we allow Silicon Valley to make these decisions we will have a Dystopian and Orwellian society. I am honored to have been asked to appear in The Creepy Line. Dr. Robert Epstein, Peter Schweitzer, and Dr. Jordan Peterson are among some of the many other distinguished experts[12] who were interviewed for the film. After watching it, my hope is that more people, especially lawmakers and regulators will realize that technology companies need to be regulated in the same manner as other industries. The only thing special about Big Tech is that they have received a Big Pass when it comes to fair and reasonable regulations.

He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book \u201cClinton Cash\u201d that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.</p><p>\u201cThe Creepy Line\u201d alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company\u2019s policy was \u201cto get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.\u201d</p><p>The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media \u2014 a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.</p><p>If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.</p><p>The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.</p><p>\u201cThis could end up being the free speech issue of our time,\u201d said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. \u201cThe Silicon Valley elites are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t care what you want to see \u2014 we know what you should see. We know better.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect foil,\u201d said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble,\u201d a book about how consumers find information online. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what\u2019s happening on Facebook, because it\u2019s closed.\u201d</p><p>Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201d</p><p>Among the panelists were James O\u2019Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.</p><p>Mr. Damore \u2014 a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies\u201d \u2014 described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.</p><p>\u201cThere are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.\u201d</p><p>Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter\u2019s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.</p><p>The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer\u2019s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new \u2014 and potentially larger \u2014 audience.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/an-exclusive-arrangement-on-a-clinton-book-and-many-questions/\">Mr. Schweizer</url>, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W.

In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.</p><p>That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.</p><p>YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/technology/youtube-right-wing-channels.html\">and it issued \u201cstrikes,\u201d or warnings</url>, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)</p><p>Facebook has also caught flak for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/business/media/facebook-news-feed-media.html\">adjusting</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/business/media/facebook-news-feed-media.html\">the algorithm</url> for its News Feed to emphasize posts from \u201cfriends, family and groups\u201d over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.</p><p>The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.</p><p>The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, \u201cFacebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming \u201ca full-on catastrophic update\u201d to Facebook\u2019s revised algorithms.</p><p>Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president\u2019s Facebook page with the headline \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.\u201d The drop, the article insinuated, occurred \u201cfollowing a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for \u2018allowing\u2019 the president to win the 2016 general election.\u201d</p><p>Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year\u2019s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.</p><p>Facebook, which sponsored a \u201chelp desk\u201d for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company <url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-vr-bullet-train-shooter-game-cpac-1202709743/\">was forced to apologize</url> for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.</p><p>Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.</p><p>Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google\u2019s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.</p><p>\u201cThe least they can do,\u201d Mr. Marlow said, \u201cis buy us a drink.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: A new film by Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, focuses on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.

Democrats and Republicans at the federal and state levels are coming together to scrutinize the power of the Silicon Valley giants and, potentially, to rein them in.</p><p>Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, announced on Friday that attorneys general in eight states \u2014 four Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 and the District of Columbia had begun an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">antitrust</url> investigation of Facebook.</p><p>Next up for state regulators is Google. A similarly bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is set to announce on Monday a separate but comparable investigation. The search giant is expected to be the focus of the inquiry, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement. Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, a Republican, is taking a leading role in the Google investigation, the people said.</p><p>The state inquiries coincide with bipartisan scrutiny of the tech giants in Washington, by House and Senate committees, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials are examining the practices of Amazon and Apple as well as those of Facebook and Google.</p><p>The companies have caught the attention of Republicans and Democrats for somewhat different reasons. President Trump and political conservatives complain that the social media giants discriminate against them. Liberals say online platforms are barely policed conduits for right-wing conspiracy theories and racism.</p><p>As a result, the various investigations reach beyond the companies\u2019 size, wealth and market power \u2014 the usual concerns of antitrust regulators. The companies\u2019 handling of consumer data, their ad-targeting practices and their role as gatekeepers of communication are all under a microscope.</p><p>\u201cThe dominance of these giant technology companies warrants a closer look,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the House antitrust subcommittee that is investigating the big tech corporations. \u201cI\u2019m glad that members of both parties understand that.\u201d</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who began an investigation of Google in 2017, when he was his state\u2019s attorney general, also cheered on the state officials.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heartened to see a new group of attorneys general with the courage to stand up to these powerful companies and fight for citizens,\u201d he said on Friday.</p><p>The federal and state inquiries of today\u2019s big tech companies are just getting started. Major investigations of industry titans like AT&amp;amp;T, IBM and Microsoft in the past were marathon endeavors, spanning years, and sometimes decades.</p><p>But Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law, said that rising public concern about the biggest tech companies was fueling the new spate of inquiries.</p><p>\u201cIt remains to be seen if we\u2019re seeing the beginning of the hard work of serious enforcement or this is mainly political theater,\u201d said Mr. First, a former official in the New York attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cBut this matters, because nothing is going to happen without political support.\u201d</p><p>Joining New York and the District of Columbia in the investigation of Facebook are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee.</p><p>Ms. James of New York said all companies \u2014 including Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media platform \u2014 must follow the law and respect consumers.</p><p>\u201cWe will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices or increased the price of advertising,\u201d Ms. James said.</p><p>In a statement, Will Castleberry, Facebook\u2019s vice president of state and local policy, said the company \u201cwill work constructively with state attorneys general, and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\u201d</p><p>A Google spokesman had a similar response. \u201cWe look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\u201d he said.</p><p>That state officials would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">investigate Facebook and other big tech companies</url> over antitrust and other issues had been expected, although the timing was unclear. The states\u2019 move follows similar steps by the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to examine how the companies have accumulated market power and whether they have acted to reduce competition. On Friday, Google disclosed to financial regulators that the Justice Department had requested documents related to past antitrust investigations into the company.</p><p>Congress is exploring the same questions. In July, executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple \u2014 the four companies that are the focus of the Justice Department\u2019s review \u2014 appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington. Another hearing is planned for next week.</p><p>State regulators, typically acting in tandem with federal officials, can play an important role in major antitrust investigations. That was the case in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>Unlike that case, the current antitrust issues extend well beyond a single company. The Justice Department, for example, is focused on companies that operate in, and have come to dominate, somewhat different markets, including internet search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks.</p><p>For Facebook, the states\u2019 antitrust investigation puts the social media giant in regulators\u2019 cross hairs yet again.</p><p>In July, the Federal Trade Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">voted to fine the company about $5 billion</url> for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, the agency\u2019s largest fine ever against a tech company. Also in July, Facebook officials faced two days of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">grilling in Congress over a new cryptocurrency initiative</url> called Libra.</p><p>The state antitrust investigation into Facebook could move in many different directions.</p><p>It might, for instance, align with the trade commission\u2019s inquiry, which is focused on whether the company used what Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder, and the prominent antitrust academics Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu have called a \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">program of serial defensive acquisitions</url>\u201d to maintain its dominance in the social-networking industry.</p><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, the photo-sharing network, for $1 billion.

Democrats and Republicans at the federal and state levels are coming together to scrutinize the power of the Silicon Valley giants and, potentially, to rein them in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, announced on Friday that attorneys general in eight states - four Democrats and four Republicans - and the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Next up for state regulators is Google. A similarly bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is set to announce on Monday a separate but comparable investigation. The search giant is expected to be the focus of the inquiry, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement. Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, a Republican, is taking a leading role in the Google investigation, the people said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state inquiries coincide with bipartisan scrutiny of the tech giants in Washington, by House and Senate committees, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials are examining the practices of Amazon and Apple as well as those of Facebook and Google.</p><p>The companies have caught the attention of Republicans and Democrats for somewhat different reasons. President Trump and political conservatives complain that the social media giants discriminate against them. Liberals say online platforms are barely policed conduits for right-wing conspiracy theories and racism.</p><p>As a result, the various investigations reach beyond the companies' size, wealth and market power - the usual concerns of antitrust regulators. The companies' handling of consumer data, their ad-targeting practices and their role as gatekeepers of communication are all under a microscope.</p><p>\"The dominance of these giant technology companies warrants a closer look,\" said Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the House antitrust subcommittee that is investigating the big tech corporations. \"I'm glad that members of both parties understand that.\"</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who began an investigation of Google in 2017, when he was his state's attorney general, also cheered on the state officials.</p><p>\"I'm heartened to see a new group of attorneys general with the courage to stand up to these powerful companies and fight for citizens,\" he said on Friday.</p><p>The federal and state inquiries of today's big tech companies are just getting started. Major investigations of industry titans like AT&amp;amp;T, IBM and Microsoft in the past were marathon endeavors, spanning years, and sometimes decades.</p><p>But Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law, said that rising public concern about the biggest tech companies was fueling the new spate of inquiries.</p><p>\"It remains to be seen if we're seeing the beginning of the hard work of serious enforcement or this is mainly political theater,\" said Mr. First, a former official in the New York attorney general's office. \"But this matters, because nothing is going to happen without political support.\"</p><p>Joining New York and the District of Columbia in the investigation of Facebook are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee.</p><p>Ms. James of New York said all companies - including Facebook, the world's largest social media platform - must follow the law and respect consumers.</p><p>\"We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising,\" Ms. James said.</p><p>In a statement, Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy, said the company \"will work constructively with state attorneys general, and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\"</p><p>A Google spokesman had a similar response. \"We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\" he said.</p><p>That state officials would  investigate Facebook and other big tech companies over antitrust and other issues had been expected, although the timing was unclear. The states' move follows similar steps by the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to examine how the companies have accumulated market power and whether they have acted to reduce competition. On Friday, Google disclosed to financial regulators that the Justice Department had requested documents related to past antitrust investigations into the company.</p><p>Congress is exploring the same questions. In July, executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple - the four companies that are the focus of the Justice Department's review - appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington. Another hearing is planned for next week.</p><p>State regulators, typically acting in tandem with federal officials, can play an important role in major antitrust investigations. That was the case in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>Unlike that case, the current antitrust issues extend well beyond a single company. The Justice Department, for example, is focused on companies that operate in, and have come to dominate, somewhat different markets, including internet search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks.</p><p>For Facebook, the states' antitrust investigation puts the social media giant in regulators' cross hairs yet again.</p><p>In July, the Federal Trade Commission voted to fine the company about $5 billion for mishandling users' personal information, the agency's largest fine ever against a tech company. Also in July, Facebook officials faced two days of grilling in Congress over a new cryptocurrency initiative called Libra.</p><p>The state antitrust investigation into Facebook could move in many different directions.</p><p>It might, for instance, align with the trade commission's inquiry, which is focused on whether the company used what Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder, and the prominent antitrust academics Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu have called a \"program of serial defensive acquisitions\" to maintain its dominance in the social-networking industry.</p><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, the photo-sharing network, for $1 billion. Two years later, it spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, a global-messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>Critics like Mr. Hughes, Mr. Hemphill and Mr. Wu believe that long before either acquisition, Mark Zuckerberg, a founder of Facebook and its chief executive, kept a close eye on start-ups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>As for Google, it escaped unscathed from a 21-month trade commission investigation that ended in 2013.

Whether it's big tech firms like Apple or small, independent developers, the new rules could make it easier for some to challenge the cable industry - and lower your cable bill.</p><p> It would allow non-cable companies to make new set-top boxes, customizing search functions, menu designs and other aspects of the user interface that consumers might not currently enjoy from their provider, officials say.</p><p> Right now, most people rent their boxes directly from their cable or satellite TV providers, to the tune of $20 billion a year, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Consumers pay, on average, about $20 a month to rent their boxes from cable providers, a congressional probe found last year.</p><p> \"Ninety-nine percent of pay-TV subscribers are chained to their set-top boxes because cable and satellite operators have locked up the market,\" according to an agency fact sheet released Wednesday.</p><p> The proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would require operators to behave differently in several ways. In general, they'd have to provide much of the information that their own set-top boxes already rely on to other companies. That includes everything related to a cable firm's channel line-up - such as which networks appear on which channels, and what programming can be found there.</p><p> Cable providers will also have to relay basic data about privileges and permissions, such as whether a device can record shows for later playback. And, of course, the companies will have to make the actual shows available to third party devices, as well.</p><p> This isn't the first time the FCC has tried to crack open the set-top box. But changes in technology are demanding new approaches to the issue, senior FCC officials told reporters Wednesday.</p><p> The cable industry's supporters are opposed to this move, lashing out at what it views as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group that launched Wednesday called the Future of TV coalition.</p><p> \"Innovation and competition should drive the creative marketplace, not government mandates that have the potential to undermine and impede the best TV market in the world,\" the group said in a release.</p><p> The FCC's proposal will be voted on at its Feb. 18 meeting. If it's approved, it will open up a proceeding to allow for public feedback before the rules are finalized during a later vote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-1396975</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BD037F88F6F NWBKIA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HYH-13W1-JD6S-R0CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Tribune, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A nonprofit organization, ERISA Access for the Self-Employed Alliance, or \"EASE Alliance,\" launched Friday to get the word out about the alternatives. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is something that I feel very strongly about,\" Tracey Schmitt Lintott, EASE Alliance executive director, said in an interview. \"Being self-employed is difficult enough without having to deal with sky-high insurance premiums.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plans in question are, in some ways, similar to the \"association health plans\" the Trump administration has authorized but that have been blocked in court, which would allow small businesses and individuals to band together to buy health insurance that is less expensive and less comprehensive than Obamacare plans. </p><p>The plans backed by the EASE Alliance instead group together people seeking insurance by involving them all in a business enterprise, one based on their internet use. They allow people to join a \"limited partnership,\" LP Management Services, in which participants download software that collects 500 hours of data about their cell phone and computer browsing history. The partnership then sells the anonymized data, and the people who joined, considered \"owners\" in the company, can get a cut of those profits. The arrangement is meant to allow the partnership to offer \"group\" insurance, which can only be sold under a specific set of rules.</p><p>But the plans may not be able to operate for long. Last month, the Department of Labor determined they were illegal under ERISA, a federal law that sets rules about how employers are supposed to offer health insurance coverage. The agency concluded that the partnership plans couldn't operate because the company didn't show that the limited partners were \"meaningfully employed by the partnership or perform any services on its behalf.\" </p><p>In other words, jointly owning something doesn't make someone an employee of an organization, explained Gary Claxton, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation's Program on the Health Care Marketplace.</p><p>\"They are trying to create some reason why they can be considered a group, but they are not,\" Claxton said. \"It has none of the attributes of group insurance.\" </p><p>In response, Data Marketing Partnership, which provides the tracking software people get when they join LP Management Services, sued the Department of Labor. EASE Alliance said its primary purpose was to support the lawsuit, and it believes the plans do comply with ERISA and have benefited those who are covered. The group wouldn't disclose how it was funded, saying only that it was formed by \"parties that are concerned that millions of Americans don't have access to affordable healthcare.\" </p><p>\"These plans are ERISA-compliant, and if you are one of the millions of Americans who can't afford Obamacare premiums and don't qualify for subsidies, you are basically out of luck when it comes to protecting your family. ... There absolutely needs to be a solution, and we believe that these plans are a really good solution,\" said Schmitt Lintott, who is also a former spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee and a former pharmaceutical executive. </p><p>The plans are a way for people who make a certain amount of money while self-employed, from Uber drivers to real estate agents and small-business owners, to get around a harsh reality: Because they have to pay for health insurance on their own, coverage is far more expensive for them than it would be for someone working at a large company where employers kick in to help pay for coverage.</p><p>Through the partnership plans, people can buy basic coverage or major medical. Costs vary depending on what people choose, so they're priced anywhere between 20%-75% compared to Obamacare plans. </p><p>The partnership is aimed at people who don't get help paying for premiums under Obamacare. By law, only people who make less than roughly 400% of the federal poverty level, or $51,040 a year for an individual, qualify for help. That means anyone making above that amount has to pay full price for coverage. There are many considerations that go into what people pay for Obamacare premiums, including age and smoking status, but on average, mid-level plans in most states cost $374 a month for an individual. Some customers have complained that their premiums cost more than their mortgage, and people have left Obamacare to join the ranks of the uninsured or to enroll in plans that won't offer the same protections. </p><p>One of the reasons Obamacare plans can be expensive is that they require coverage for a range of medical services, from maternity care to mental health and prescription drugs. Plans trying to skirt Obamacare, such as those the partnership offers, leave out different benefits or can decide not to cover care associated with certain medical conditions. Critics of alternative insurance worry about this arrangement, given that people often cannot predict when they'll face a serious medical condition. </p><p>\"Most of these alternative arrangements have to go back to medically excluding people who are sick,\" said Claxton from the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"It\u2019s really easy to make insurance cheaper if you only cover people who aren't sick and if you penalize them if they get sick.\"</p><p>Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, which has been supportive of Obamacare, reviewed the arrangements and said she worried \"about what people might be giving up in data privacy, not to mention the consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act,\" which is the formal name for Obamacare. </p><p>Marc Machiz, a former Department of Labor official, said he would be concerned about whether this plan or others who decide to take on a similar model would be financially sustainable. If plans become insolvent, then people's medical bills would go unpaid. </p><p>\u201cIt couldn't be a worse idea,\" he said. \"In all my years of experience, if I sat down to design a nightmare, it would be this structure.\u201d </p><p>Schmitt Lintott pushed back on concerns about privacy issues, saying the plans were in \"sharp contrast to big tech, which takes that data from Americans every day without their consent and sells it for large profits.\" The alliance stressed that the data is anonymous and that workers have control over what information gets shared, including the ability to delete and turn off the collection when they want to. The group also said it only supports plans that protect against discrimination, are financially stable, and provide access to affordable healthcare. </p><p>As the lawsuit moves ahead, Obamacare's future is being weighed in court, and Congress continues to face gridlock on the law. A bipartisan bill that would have injected more funding into Obamacare collapsed in 2018 because of a disagreement on abortion. Another bill from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would inject billions of dollars into the law so more people would qualify for subsidies, making premiums cheaper to beneficiaries but increasing federal spending.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, February 12th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Bernie Sanders takes New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg takes second. And Amy Klobuchar surges to third place. Former Vice President Joe Biden taking a disappointing fifth place yesterday, turning his attention now to South Carolina, where he hopes to gain ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, two more Democrats dropping out of the race. Andrew Yang and Michael Bennett end their run for the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lloyd Blankfein, meanwhile, warning a Bernie Sanders presidency will ruin our economy. More on socialism versus capitalism coming up.</p><p>Bed, Bath and Beyond in plummeting this morning in the pre-market. Same store sales declining in December and in January. The company facing inventory challenges, issues attracting customers. The stock is down 24 percent right now.</p><p>U.S. officials say Huawei does indeed have a backdoor allowing access to mobile phones around the world. The secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, is here in half an hour to discuss this potential threat to security.</p><p>Millennial money mistakes. We're taking a look at what they are and how to avoid them.</p><p>And then this, living Armani style. A look inside the luxury Miami residences designed by the famed fashion house.</p><p>Plus, more fashion icons. Badgley Mischka founders Mark Badgley and James Mischka are here in the studio this morning to tell us what's hot at New York Fashion Week and the rise of second-hand fashion.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>And markets this morning are looking to rally at the start of trading. Take a look at futures indicated a gain at the start of trading of 124 points on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq up 50 points and the S&amp;P right now is up 13.</p><p>This on top of another record setter yesterday. Yesterday the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 closed in uncharted territory, record highs. That's the second day in a row that we see new highs for the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P. Global markets this morning, the momentum continues. European indices are higher across the board despite the fact that the Eurozone industrial production report was out and it shrank 2.1 percent in December month over month. That is higher than expected.</p><p>In Asia overnight, green across the board there as well despite concerns about the coronavirus. Investors believe there will be some moves made to stimulate the economy during this outbreak certainly in China.</p><p>Our top story coming up, the New Hampshire primary. Senator Bernie Sanders claiming a narrow victory over Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both candidates weighed in on their victories last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: With victories behind us, popular vote in Iowa and the victory here tonight, we are going to Nevada. We're going to South Carolina.</p><p>We are taking on billionaires and we're taking on candidates funded by billionaires.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thanks to you, a campaign that some said shouldn't be here at all has shown that we are here to stay.</p><p>Election after election has shown us that putting forward a new perspective is how Democrats win the White House. And we will win the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, finished strong. She gained momentum. She rose to the third place there in New Hampshire. Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden came in fourth and fifth place. Biden actually left New Hampshire early last night for South Carolina, where he's expected to have a little more support.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, \"New York Post\" editorial board member Kelly Torrance is here, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman.</p><p>What a race.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Amazing.</p><p>KELLY TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, \"THE NEW YORK POST\": I'm enjoying watching this, I have to say. You know, it's funny because every -- on the debate stage, if you remember George Stephanopoulos asked the candidates, are any of you worried about a Democratic socialist at the top of the ticket, and only Amy Klobuchar would put her hand up.</p><p>And I have to say, I mean, really, isn't this one of the reasons Joe Biden is running? Isn't, you know -- of course Mike Bloomberg wasn't on that stage, but the DNC has changed its rules so he will be on the next debate stage. And so he's really, I think, the -- the one to watch out of this.</p><p>And, in a way, he was a -- he was kind of a winner of these, even though, of course, he didn't even try because he didn't lose anything, which I think everybody lost a lot of momentum out of Iowa. The party lost a lot of momentum.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: The -- but you brought up the debate. This is a reminder, debate performances do matter because Amy Klobuchar did really well on Friday night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And she essentially -- and a lot of people have tweeted this, including a writer from \"The Washington Post\" -- she denied Pete Buttigieg probably a victory by this surge. She's going to have money issues going into these later states, particularly South Carolina and, of course, Super Tuesday in March. And that's also an issue for Joe Biden. Joe Biden started the year with, I think, $9 million, and it's going to be very, very tight. That's why he -- he didn't want to be in New Hampshire --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In fifth place at a -- at a rally where he has to apologize for being so unfocused and undisciplined if they're like people -- what if there are only a couple people in the audience clapping for the guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and if he runs out of money --</p><p>TORRANCE: And then he'd probably insult them anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's running out of money. And if he runs out of money, he's done after South Carolina. I'm -- but what about -- what about Bernie. I mean what will the Democrat establishment do about Bernie when you've got this capitalism versus socialism subject in front of us.</p><p>Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein weighed in on this on Twitter over his warning about electing a socialist president. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs writes this, if Dems go on to nominate Sanders, the Russians will have to reconsider who to work for to best screw up the U.S. Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump and he'll ruin our economy and doesn't care about our military. If I'm Russian, I go with Sanders this time around.</p><p>This coming as a new Gallup poll shows only 45 percent of Americans would actually vote for a socialist president, 53 percent would not, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and we see now he's basically more or less tied with Buttigieg in delegates. I -- I think if you're -- if you're looking on the bright side here, you're looking at a smaller share of the vote for Bernie Sanders than he got in winning in 2016. I -- you look at that Klobuchar surge and it's encouraging, as you say. She was the one raising her hand saying, I have a problem with socialism.</p><p>And what's also encouraging is, she's not just saying I think it creates an electability problem. She's talking about why it's bad. And after that debate, campaigning in New Hampshire, she talked about the value of entrepreneurship, which obviously is not allowed under socialism.</p><p>So I think we may be seeing a resurgence in the Democratic Party of appreciation for where all of this prosperity comes from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One quick thing.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren -- my take is that she's the biggest loser. Joe Biden still has decent or -- to strong support among black voters. He's strong with unions. He's got Harry Reid on his -- at his side in Nevada. And then, of course, the black vote in South Carolina.</p><p>But Elizabeth Warren came in fourth. She was in single digits. She got no delegates. And she has shown a complete lack of ability to change up her tactics. She's kind of going ahead, I'm doing the same thing, and where is that going to leave you. She's got -- she's on -- and people talk about Joe Biden being on the ropes. She's definitely on the ropes at this point and - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder what President Obama is going to say to Joe Biden? I mean at some point Obama is going to have to come out and endorse somebody and he's all over Bloomberg's commercials. I don't know if he needed the approval of that, but, you know, Bloomberg has a commercial out where it's all President Obama saying how great Michael Bloomberg is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's not -- President Obama, you will not hear anything from him until the convention. You will -- he is -- he's playing golf --</p><p>TORRANCE: Am I the only one that thinks Mayor Pete's starting to sound like Obama, though?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's playing golf and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's in Bloomberg's commercials and I don't know how they would allow that without at least a conversation, I'm going to be running - - I mean the commercial is all Obama, of Bloomberg, so, you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he -- he's playing golf and winning Academy Awards. Their production company won an Academy Award for the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, there's that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For the feature length documentary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And in terms of -- I think Bill McGurn wrote about this, \"Saturday Night Live,\" in their sketch over the weekend, did a riff on Pete Buttigieg about hash tag white Obama, as if --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think certainly the Buttigieg campaign would like people to think of him that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But I don't -- I don't see it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We -- we've got more that we're following this morning. The other top stories, Nissan is seeking $91 million from former Chairman Carlos Ghosn now. More legal problems for Ghosn. The automaker following a civil lawsuit claiming damages for alleged financial misconduct. It also warned it expects the amount claimed in damages to increase in the future. Ghosn, you know, fled from Japan into Lebanon back in December. He is denying any wrongdoing this morning.</p><p>Federal regulators reportedly expanding their anti-trust investigation into big tech companies. The Federal Trade Commission ordering Apple, Amazon, FaceBook and Microsoft, as well as Google's parent Alphabet to provide details of their past deals, even if they're small deals. This is the top story in \"The Journal\" this morning. At issue is whether the technology giant's takeovers were anti-competitive and harmful to customers.</p><p>Quite an odyssey for Honda. The automaker recalling nearly 250,000 2018- 2020 models of its best-selling minivan. The callback prompted by a wiring problem, could spark a fire. Honda says owners will be notified by mail. Dealers will fix the wiring or replace it.</p><p>Coming up this morning, millennial money mistakes. The top ways they are wasting money and how to fix the problem.</p><p>Plus this, Armani's new game. The fashion house entering the real estate game now. Some stunning images right here coming up.</p><p>And Badgley Mischka in the house this morning. The designers are here talking all things fashion. Don't miss that.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>Plus, Huawei security threat. U.S. national security official issuing a warning. Senate Homeland and Government Affairs Committee member James Lankford will joins us next on the risks.</p><p>Then, Disneyland raises ticket prices again. What it could mean for your next vacation. Details right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The threat from Huawei. \"The Wall Street Journal\" out with a report this morning detailing backdoors the Chinese telecom giant is using to gain access to customers. It's an issue I've been pressing now for month, especially with Huawei's chief security officer, Andy Purdy.</p><p>I brought it up again in November. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why don't you just change the backdoors? Why don't you just change the infrastructure at Huawei so that you don't have backdoors going to the Chinese communist party? I mean we know that there have been a number of situations where backdoors were found, even when Huawei said they weren't. I mean I point to Vodafone Italy discovering the hidden backdoors of Huawei equipment that would have allowed the Chinese company to access user's home networks, as well as Vodafone's Italian fixed line network because of the backdoors that they discovered inadvertently, Andy.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: So, Maria, why is it that the European Union, Germany and the U.K. are OK with allowing Huawei to be part of those networks?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe because it's cheap.</p><p>PURDY: Why are they putting in the kind of measures we recommend --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe because it's cheap.</p><p>PURDY: Which are comprehensive measures that address the risk from all provide.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he pushed back on that aggressively.</p><p>Joining me right now is Oklahoma Senator, member of the Senate Finance Committee and Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee, James Lankford.</p><p>Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): It's good to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So why don't you assess this for us, sir. I mean, you know, we've got four members of the Chinese military indicted over the Equifax breach.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got China lying to us when coronavirus started. You've got Huawei, with all of these backdoors across the world where data goes right back to the communist government.</p><p>How do you see it?</p><p>LANKFORD: Yes, that -- you're describing it exactly correctly in the sense that Huawei can reach in and the communist government can reach into whatever data, whatever voice, whatever communications you have. If you have a Huawei device on -- anywhere in the network system that allows the communist government to be able to reach in and be able to grab that information, we do not allow that in the United States. Many of our allies do not allow that. Britain has already come out since that interview you did in November -- Britain has already come out and said we're not -- we're only going to allow it in certain places. We continue to be able to talk with the British government to say, OK, we have real concerns if you have Huawei anywhere in the system. The EU is dragging their feet on this, but a lot of countries around the world are one by one looking at the system, looking at the technology and saying, we do not want a communist government to have access to all of our information, rightfully so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Pompeo gave a great speech this week to the governors and he basically said, under Xi Jinping, the country is having more repression, more unfair competition, more predatory economic practices, indeed a more aggressive military posture as well, as their goals are to overtake the United States economically and militarily.</p><p>What should we do about this?</p><p>LANKFORD: We should continue to have a thriving economy. We should continue to make trade deals with people around the world. And we -- should continue to be able to press back on China and say, you don't get unlimited access for our economy because you have major issues with your human rights record.</p><p>It's right for us to be able to establish some trade relationships there, as we have with people all over the world, but we should stand up and speak out for people like the Uighurs and other folks that are facing incredible persecution in China from the communist government there and not say that China is just like every other nation. They are not. They have a very different structure and the people of China live under an oppressive regime.</p><p>FREEMAN: Hi, Senator, James Freeman at \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>I'm wondering, this -- this us government decision to share the fact that Huawei has backdoors in their equipment that they have not told their telecom customers about. I'm assuming that the -- the government non- publicly had -- our government had previously shared with other countries this fact. It -- going public now, is it an effort to tell the citizens of those countries about this threat because obviously some of them have not gotten along with the Huawei band.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right. We have a lot of private interactions with our partners all around the world to say, here are the concerns. We're not just being flipping about this. This is not just about competition saying you should use American products or western product rather than Chinese product. We have very real concerns. We have shared those concerns in a -- in a way privately to be able to go through the process, but if they don't do that, we do need to make people aware worldwide, here are the real issues that you're going to face if you have this type of equipment that is hooked up to anywhere in the network.</p><p>The difference is, in many parts of the world, we don't see it in the United States, but many parts of the world, if you travel around, you're going to see Huawei stores everywhere. And so there's a familiarity with that brand. In the United States, we're not family with that brand, seeing it day to day all over the streets. But just like you see Apple stores here, if you traveled around much of the world, you'd see Huawei stores there. And so a lot of people are saying, well, I know that photo, or they have a mobile phone that's a Huawei phone. What's wrong with that network? We're trying to be able to say, here's the problem with the network. If you make a decision to be able to have them on your system, you're making a decision for communist China to have access to all of your phone communications and your data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is there more to do? I mean consider the fact that there are so called Confucius centers all throughout the country at -- right next to our important universities.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is another thing that Secretary Pompeo brought up yesterday, and he said that there's all of this soft pressures going on at the school board level that last year a high school -- a high school in Chicago disinvited a Taiwanese representative to serve on a climate panel after Chinese pressure.</p><p>And then you've got reports of Chinese government officials pressuring Chinese students -- Chinese students studying in the United States right now to monitor fellow Chinese students and to report back to Beijing.</p><p>So, I mean -- and then you've got this idea that the thrift fund, this is the 401(k) for our military, past and present, half a trillion dollars in money, they want to put 10 percent of that money to mimic the MSCI, where many of those companies in the MSCI index are Chinese companies making military equipment, making the equipment used to monitor the Uighurs and we want our military men to invest in that? I don't get it.</p><p>LANKFORD: We -- we do not want them to be invested in this. Obviously the Chinese government's been very, very engaged and the communist party there has been very engaged, not only in all of those areas you just described, but in the U.N. and the World Bank and multiple other spots to get Chinese leaders in those locations to be able to make decisions, to be able to then influence policy around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LANKFORD: And they continue to be able to extend loans too many countries around the world saying, we're going to help you with this loan knowing that country can't pay it back. And they say, well, great, well we'll base our military here as leverage for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>LANKFORD: So there's -- there's major issues dealing with communist China. We need to remember, again, this is not like every other country, every other government in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, before you go, Senator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is going to appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal. Real quick on this, $4.8 trillion plan is aiming to lower the deficit by $4.6 trillion over ten years, dedicate money toward infrastructure, the border, as well as Medicare and welfare reforms. It's certainly a long time before we're going to see any balance in this budget, sir.</p><p>LANKFORD: It is. We're way out of balance. And I tell a lot of people, we don't have a mortgage, we have a jumbo mortgage, and it will take decades for us to be able to pay this down, but we've got to have some focus on it.</p><p>I am pleased that the Trump administration is starting to be able to articulate even more here are the ways that we're going to try to chip away at our debt and deficit, because we have to do this. And they are decision that have to be made. They're spending more on homelessness. They're spending less in other areas. They're spending more on coronavirus, they're spending less on other areas, trying to be able to figure out, how do we not only get back to balance, how do we set some priorities.</p><p>Now, they do have very optimistic economic growth numbers for every single year, have 3 percent growth, but that's -- that's a positive thing. We've obviously seen incredible growth in our economy, but we've got to be able to make some real, serious decisions on what are our national priorities and how do we actually deal with not only waste and fraud and abuse, but how do we deal with just basic duplication or say this issue is more important than this issue because we've got to make hard decisions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, they do have rosy predictions, not just 3 percent growth but 2 percent yields, Treasury yields for ten years. We'll see.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you.</p><p>LANKFORD: Good to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James Lankford joining us there in D.C.</p><p>Coming up, problems for Bed, Bath and Beyond. The company's stock is diving after an ominous earnings report. The stock is down 25 percent right now.</p><p>And then avoiding financial pitfalls. Millennials, listen up, we are taking a look at how you're wasting a lot of money. See how you can fix the problem after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Big loss this morning for shares of big box giant Bed, Bath and Beyond. The stock is plunging on weak holiday sales. The 5.4 percent decline is attributed to a lower foot traffic in the store. This is -- the stock right now is down 25 percent and they are saying that they've got inventory management problems and higher markdowns. CEO Mark Tritton, who joined the company late last year, said that the company is facing short-term pains, but it is now modernizing sales and strategies.</p><p>A bifurcated story in retail for sure, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I guess to paraphrase Will Ferrell, they have not had a lot of nice little Saturdays lately in terms of foot traffic to Bed, Bath and Beyond. But -- so you have -- obviously ongoing general challenge for traditional retail with the -- with the pressure of the Internet and maybe on top of that a -- a marketing issue here as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You heard it here first. I called this, remember --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You did. You said it was boring.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When I totally started ripping on Bed, Bath and Beyond. That it's not a -- the bed and the bath items are kind of garbagey. They don't compete well with the online direct to consumer brands like Brooke Linen or even Redland -- the Redland cotton sheets. So if you go in there, their stock is uneven. You can't -- oh, I want two pillows, they've only got one that I want to buy. And then the rest of the store looks like a junkie drugstore or pharmacy. It's like food --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a bit of a mess. It's a bit of a mess. I have gotten nice things at Bed, Bath and Beyond, just saying. I -- you know, I have bought things there and I like it, but, you're right, the store looks like a bit of a mess.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like, you walk in and it's like, I'm here to buy really nice towels. I don't need a five gallon jar of like gummy bears. Maybe they don't sell five gallons of gummy bears --</p><p>FREEMAN: That's the beyond. That's the beyond.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the beyond.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: It doesn't -- it -- the -- again, like when you walk -- you -- they need to up the game in terms of the quality of the bed and the bath component of this store.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he says he's modernizing it, so we'll keep watching that one.</p><p>Coming up, ending America's longest war. Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy on the reported deal with the Taliban.</p><p>Plus, Armani's new game. The fashion powerhouse takes on real estate now. The stunning images coming up.</p><p>All that right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February 12th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are higher once again; we're looking at a pretty good rally at the start of trading and the averages hitting all-time highs again. Dow Futures up 127 points, NASDAQ up 47 and the S&amp;P up 13.</p><p>This on top of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday closing at record highs for a second straight day. This is uncharted territory with the NASDAQ up 10 points yesterday, the S&amp;P up five, the Dow Industrials finished down half a point.</p><p>Oil prices this morning look like this, OPEC cutting its forecast for global growth in oil demand for 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak. World oil expected -- demand is expected to rise by 990,000 barrels a day this year.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly higher, European indices seeing green across the board despite the fact that we had economic data out this morning. The euro zone industrial production shrank 2.1 percent in December month over month, that was higher-than-expected.</p><p>Nonetheless, the FT-100 is up 80 points, the CAC Quarante is up 23 and the DAX Index is up 105.</p><p>In Asia overnight, green across the board despite concerns about the coronavirus. Investors believe that there will be more moves to stimulate the economies of Asia during this outbreak.</p><p>Meanwhile, safety in question at Southwest Airlines putting pressure on the FAA on how it does its job. Lauren Simonetti with those details now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I sure have those details, Maria. Southwest Airlines flew 17 million passengers on more than 150,000 flights on potentially dangerous jets, that according to a report by the U.S. Transportation Department's Inspector General. The FAA admitting it could have done a better job policing repairs at Southwest.</p><p>In the meantime, we wanted to tell you this. The airline's flight attendants, they're saying stop fooling around and they're calling on passengers to let them know of any bad behavior during a flight. It's all part of a new policy. So if you see something, say something.</p><p>Americans are racking up a record amount of debt, this is for last year. The New York Federal Reserve says a top $14 trillion, that's the biggest annual jump since just before the financial crisis.</p><p>Credit card debt also hitting a record high at $930 billion but most of the overall debt is driven by mortgage loans, people taking advantage of low rates.</p><p>Well, unfortunately, the happiest place on earth just got more expensive. Disneyland in California reportedly raising ticket prices.

The price tag for multi-day passes is also growing up. Wow. That is a lot of money to go see one of the new parks for the adventures of Disneyland.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They've been raising prices consistently by the way.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, but over 200, Maria, for a pass?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, incredible. Lauren, thank you. Lauren Simonetti there.</p><p>Defense budget boost meanwhile, President Trump releasing a $4.8 trillion budget proposal earlier this week, it increases military spending to $740 billion for fiscal year 2021. It comes as the U.S. Army unveils its $178 billion budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 at a slightly less than the $180 billion allocated for 2020.</p><p>If approved it will include a three percent pay increase for troops and a 2.9 percent increase in basic allowance for housing. It is also investing in new technologies like A.I. and quantum computing.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy. Mr. Secretary, it' great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, SECRETARY OF THE ARMY: Great to be on Maria, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let's talk about the budget and what the priorities are here. I think it's an interesting component that you are going to see an increase in things like artificial intelligence and quantum computer -- computing rather, tell us where the priorities are and why.</p><p>MCCARTHY: We -- so this budget in the 21 cycle, we're in about our third year of our transformation in the U.S. Army. You'll see a 26 percent year- over-year increase from FY20 to FY21 in our modernization accounts.</p><p>So, $800 million for hypersonic glide body missiles, over a billion dollars to bring in two new helicopter platforms into our fleet.</p><p>To the point you made about artificial intelligence, the Army has invested over $800 million over the next five years to get cloud computing across the entire enterprise.</p><p>So, we're trying to strike the balance between (INAUDIBLE) the 60 percent of national requirements worldwide as -- so we have forces deployed in 140 countries but also a robust modernization effort that's been underway for three years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary, where does this take us in terms of getting the Army back in balance? We know that the Army got crushed during sequestration.</p><p>By the way, the Navy as well. We've got equipment that is not flyable, that is not usable because of the starvation that the Army and the Navy and other agencies went through because of sequestration.</p><p>So, do you feel that you're getting back to balance in terms of having the proper equipment that is required to face the threats that this country does?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Great point. Over the last three years we took basically two brigade combat teams at the highest levels of readiness to 26. So that took a lot of funding but it took fanatical intensity with the leadership of General Mark Milley and Jim McConville in particular.</p><p>But in the modernization effort it's going to take longer. We're three years into it and it's going to take at least five to six years of the consistent investment and we press through the developmental cycle.</p><p>Now we've done some things through restructuring the Army and creating a four-star modernization organization to reduce the span time and decision- making.</p><p>But ultimately, it's that sustain consistent funding over time is going to get us out of the hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let's talk about the threats. We've got a Fox Business alert right now. American forces came under attack in Syria this morning by pro- Syrian regime forces according to a U.S. military spokesperson. The American troops then returned fire. No immediate casualties had been reported. What can you tell us about this incident?</p><p>MCCARTHY: The developments are ongoing. We got an initial sitrep that came out of the central command, these are the sort of things that we take a step back. Usually the first indications on the battlefield are going to be changed. So this will develop over the next 24 hours and we'll be able to tell the media, the American people a lot more as it develops.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, because we've got -- you know, thoughts and hopes of peace in the Middle East, the U.S. and the Taliban expected to announce a peace deal today that would withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Where do we stand in terms of troops in Afghanistan?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Secretary Esper is in Brussels meeting with his counterparts at NATO and they're going to be talking about just that, the negotiations with the Taliban and ultimately what could lead to a troop reduction in head towards a political settlement.</p><p>So, a lot could happen over the next 48 hours in Brussels.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean -- I mean, this is a terrorist organization, right? I mean, how do you deal with the Taliban in an honest way knowing that the group on the other side of the table are terrorists?</p><p>MCCARTHY: So within the Taliban ranks, you've historically you see what they have the kind of the hardliner big t Taliban and then the little t, the people on the street that find opportunity because of economics or rule of law and it helps them just with their way of life.</p><p>So, we have reduced the hardliner strength within the Taliban organization and found opportunities to drive towards the political settlement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Mr. Secretary, let me ask you about the China technology threat, the Journal is out with a report this morning detailing the back doors that Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant is using to gain access to its customers.</p><p>I've been talking about these back doors now for two years in that -- you know, you've got a Huawei infrastructure in a country like let's call it in Africa or in Europe where the data goes right back to the Chinese Communist Party and this is ongoing.</p><p>The Journal -- you know, reports this this morning but we knew this was happening. What can we do with the China threat?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Specifically to Huawei that there's clearly investment second being made in technologies for us so that we can use our -- you know, American carriers to support us with our networks.</p><p>In the larger scale of competition with China and Russia in particular, the U.S. presence worldwide helps strengthen these local governments, it creates greater confidence for American business to invest in new markets.</p><p>You'll see with the Army, we have over 180,000 people deployed in 140 countries. And with that consistency of presence helps strengthen those local governments and strengthens relationship with the U.S. government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you want our viewers to know Secretary McCarthy, about what's happening at the Army today given your budget is about to come out as well as the threats that exist today given the weakness that we've seen around sequestration. What do you want our viewers to take away today?</p><p>MCCARTHY: To have an appreciation for what it takes for 180,000 people to be consistently deployed worldwide to support national objectives, to modernize our weapon systems, so we (INAUDIBLE) the technological margin to win in combat operations and to know that the U.S. Army leadership is doing everything it can to make every dollar count, make every soldier count with reform efforts that have been unprecedented in our history.</p><p>This is a tough business and but we know that these dollars are precious. We treat dollars like ammunition in the Army.</p><p>So, we're trying to do the best we can with a very generous budget that we can be consistently getting over the last three years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service and a big shout out and a big thank you to all of the soldiers for their service past and present in the Army. Thank you, sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Ryan McCarthy there.</p><p>Coming up, Mrs. Dow Jones here in the studio. The Instagram influencer is here next on how you can avoid big-money mistakes.</p><p>Then, Armani's new design, the fashion powerhouse takes on real estate now. We're taking you inside when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, there are roughly 80 million millennials in the United States and each year they spent approximately $600 billion.</p><p>My next guest is here to discuss how Generation Y can manage money. She calls herself a financial popstar and for good reason she makes finance funds for her followers on her popular YouTube channel and Instagram account.</p><p>Joining me right now is Mrs. Dow Jones founder Haley Sacks. Haley, it's great to have you.</p><p>HALEY SACKS, FOUNDER, MRS. DOW JONES: Thank you so much for having me, Maria. I'm such a big fan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>SACKS: I'm so excited to be here.</p><p>First of all, I don't want to call them money mistakes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>SACKS: Because I feel like there's so much shame around money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SACKS: And really, you know, it's hard to know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What should we call them -- what should we call them, Haley?</p><p>SACKS: I think these are just good tips.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Missteps (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SACKS: These are -- these are the things that long hanging fruit that you can do that will make you financially savvy and set you up so that you have a great future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are they now? You're saying Mrs. Dow Jones has take emergency fund investing debt payoff plan and spending mindlessly. Let's go through it.</p><p>SACKS: Exactly. So, let's start with off the emergency fund, this is your cushion, your safety net. You want to make sure that you have an emergency fund so that just in case anything happens to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Life throws you curveballs.</p><p>SACKS: All the time, you know. Three to six months of expenses, you got to have in the bank.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>SACKS: And then of course investing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What the heck is that? Sorry, my phone -- my phone is -- sorry. Oh, I did -- I don't know what I did, it won't stop. Sorry, please take my phone away. Go ahead.</p><p>SACKS: It's OK. I mean, sometimes your future is calling, Maria. That's what just happened. That's why you've got to make sure that you are investing because it's honestly more about time in the market than time being off the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so let's talk about this for a second. It's not timing of the market, it's time in the market, matching your 401(k) as much as possible has been my rule of thumb for my entire career. My first job I got into my company's 401(k), that was CNN.</p><p>SACKS: And CNBC of course.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SACKS: Did you carry your 401(k) over to Fox Business?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I absolutely did.</p><p>SACKS: That's what we like to hear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, absolutely.</p><p>SACKS: Don't call her the money honey for nothing, yes. That's a huge mistake that people make though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They do.</p><p>SACKS: When they -- you know, they move jobs and they just leave their 401(k).</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then they take it out and get tax on it.</p><p>SACKS: Oh my gosh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big mistake.</p><p>SACKS: Big, huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>SACKS: Yes. So, obviously you got to do your 401(k).</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you say you need a debt pay off plan. What does that mean?</p><p>SACKS: I am just all about having a goal. I think that the reason that money is so scary is like managing your money, is that you don't know where to start.</p><p>And so especially with that, if you have student loans, it's such a huge amount, you're like cool, how am I ever going to pay that off?</p><p>But if you break it down into little roadblocks and little goals, then you can really start to chip away a bit and before you know it, three-five years from now, you could be debt free.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You need a plan.</p><p>SACKS: You need a plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the bottom line.</p><p>SACKS: Fail to plan, plan to fail.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about what you call spending mindlessly? Let's go through that.</p><p>SACKS: So, I'm all about spending more on the things that you are really into and spending less on the things that don't really matter to you. I think that social pressures really affect the way that we spend. But you know, maybe you don't want to go to that bachelorette party that's going to cost you $1,000.</p><p>You know, maybe you would rather save that money and spend some of it on doing something that you really want to do and put the rest of it in -- you know, put in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What you're saying is you've got to make decisions, got to have priorities?</p><p>SACKS: You've got to have priorities and you got to -- you can't be swayed. You got to keep your mind on your money and your money in your mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I love it. Haley, thank you. Great tips.</p><p>SACKS: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>SACKS: Great to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mrs. Dow Jones, Haley Sacks.</p><p>SACKS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When we come back, Armani's new game, the fashion powerhouse takes on real estate. The stunning images are here, we've got them, stay with us. Cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a new breed of multi-million-dollar luxury condos popping up along Miami's beaches. More people flee high taxes in New York and New Jersey and Connecticut and they're going there.</p><p>Cheryl Casone is in Miami this morning after residences in Armani Casa. Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, Good morning, Maria. Yes, and this was designed head to toe, top to bottom by Giorgio Armani himself. And he worked with a local developer Gil Dezer who took us on a grand tour of the grand opening of Armani Casa, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASONE: Ok, Gil, here we go. Show me residences by Armani Casa. This is incredible what you've done here.</p><p>GIL DEZER, PRESIDENT, DEZER DEVELOPMENT: Thank you very much, welcome to our new tower.</p><p>CASONE: What do you want people to experience when they walk into the building?</p><p>DEZER: Well, the idea of doing an Armani Casa building is to really show Armani's lifestyle outside of the brand, not just the clothing line that everybody knows about.</p><p>If you've been to their hotels or have you seen any of their furniture lines, you can really see that we took the essence of what is Armani and we put it into this building.</p><p>You can really see and feel what Armani is all about. This is a customer designed sofa done from (INAUDIBLE) the sofas here. The wallpaper you can see there is the Armani wallpaper print as well.</p><p>CASONE: And I just want to point out here, the Armani logo is on every pillow in the lobby.</p><p>DEZER: It's also about living in a hotel lifestyle inside your residence. You have a spa here, this is your waiting room area. You have your manicure, pedicure and everything done right here.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>DEZER: In the building without ever having to leave.</p><p>CASONE: All right.</p><p>DEZER: Here as well, bring your glam squad down.</p><p>Well, really what it is is as you see, we're in this (INAUDIBLE) the room in a condominium building. So there's no hotel aspect here, there's no trending guests. People are coming and going but it's like living in a hotel because you have all the hotel services available right downstairs.</p><p>This is a theater.</p><p>CASONE: A movie theater.</p><p>DEZER: Right, you're having your own private movie theater in your -- in your house. The idea of having the theater inside your building is like, is if you are having your own private mansion with your -- with your rooms upstairs.</p><p>We have a cigar bar because sometimes the wife -- you know, gets tired of the smell of cigars inside the house. So if she kicks you out, and you have a place to go downstairs.</p><p>We also have a great wine room for people to really enjoy the bottles of wine, we have the right temperature refrigeration system. So put them in and so people can leave their wine there and also just access it from our - - from our somebody downstairs in the restaurant.</p><p>CASONE: There's a play room as well, right? Is that for all the swimming -- I mean, it's Florida, I'm thinking the grandkids are going to need that playroom. I don't know.</p><p>DEZER: The grandkids on a rainy day because we have the beach in the back. So they should be playing under the sun. But assuming it's a rainy day, we've got some (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>My partner George Perez is avid art collector, he's also the founder of the PAMM, the Perez Art Museum in Miami. And so we left that entirely up to him because he's really the expert in that ground.</p><p>We still have a few apartments available, ranging price from 1.7 up to $17 million.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>DEZER: This is definitely one of the best buildings if not the best building in Miami, definitely self-order and could be potentially in the United States. So it's definitely worth a check out if you're coming down to take a look at it.</p><p>CASONE: I think we should say a final toast to Giorgio Armani, great job on this development.</p><p>DEZER: Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: And cheers.</p><p>DEZER: Cheers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASONE: And Maria, cheers to Giorgio Armani. And of course, a lovely, beautiful sunny day here in Sunny Isles, Florida. Now, this beach is really becoming the luxury capital just north of Miami.</p><p>Now again, everything is Armani. I just had to wear my favorite Armani dress just for you Maria this morning. And I had three glasses of champagne to toast back to you ladies in New York. I have one for you, one for Dagen and in spirit, I send this salute back to you in New York City, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So now you're teasing us with it. Now you're rubbing in our faces in effect that you're in Miami and it's about to rain in New York City. And Dagen and I are here watching you.</p><p>So, how did she get this assignment, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Cheryl. Don't make me tell you what you can do with that champagne.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We love you, Cheryl. Have fun -- have fun in Armani. We will see you when you get back to New York. Great stuff.</p><p>I think Armani actually has a hotel in Milan but it's interesting to see this how designers are coming up with new ideas whether it's restaurants in stores or hotels.</p><p>TORRANCE: You know, making a part of the whole lifestyle experience. You know, if you like someone's aesthetic in clothing, maybe you want that aesthetic all around you.</p><p>And you know, someone like Armani, he can do this I think. He's talented enough and he's got enough vision.</p><p>FREEMAN: It looks very nice, but I could never leave New Jersey. I've fallen in love with the property taxes and the unfunded pension liability. So I just -- I just couldn't think of ever leaving.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Still ahead, 2020 is heating up. 2020 Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard on last night's primary and her future in the race. She's here next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Democrats and Republicans at the federal and state levels are coming together to scrutinize the power of the Silicon Valley giants and, potentially, to rein them in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, announced on Friday that attorneys general in eight states -- four Democrats and four Republicans -- and the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Next up for state regulators is Google. A similarly bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is set to announce on Monday a separate but comparable investigation. The search giant is expected to be the focus of the inquiry, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement. Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, a Republican, is taking a leading role in the Google investigation, the people said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The state inquiries coincide with bipartisan scrutiny of the tech giants in Washington, by House and Senate committees, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials are examining the practices of Amazon and Apple as well as those of Facebook and Google.</p><p>  The companies have caught the attention of Republicans and Democrats for somewhat different reasons. President Trump and political conservatives complain that the social media giants discriminate against them. Liberals say online platforms are barely policed conduits for right-wing conspiracy theories and racism.</p><p>  As a result, the various investigations reach beyond the companies' size, wealth and market power -- the usual concerns of antitrust regulators. The companies' handling of consumer data, their ad-targeting practices and their role as gatekeepers of communication are all under a microscope.</p><p>  ''The dominance of these giant technology companies warrants a closer look,'' said Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the House antitrust subcommittee that is investigating the big tech corporations. ''I'm glad that members of both parties understand that.''</p><p>  Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who began an investigation of Google in 2017, when he was his state's attorney general, also cheered on the state officials.</p><p>  ''I'm heartened to see a new group of attorneys general with the courage to stand up to these powerful companies and fight for citizens,'' he said on Friday.</p><p>  The federal and state inquiries of today's big tech companies are just getting started. Major investigations of industry titans like AT&amp;T, IBM and Microsoft in the past were marathon endeavors, spanning years, and sometimes decades.</p><p>  But Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law, said that rising public concern about the biggest tech companies was fueling the new spate of inquiries.</p><p>  ''It remains to be seen if we're seeing the beginning of the hard work of serious enforcement or this is mainly political theater,'' said Mr. First, a former official in the New York attorney general's office. ''But this matters, because nothing is going to happen without political support.''</p><p>  Joining New York and the District of Columbia in the investigation of Facebook are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee.</p><p>  Ms. James of New York said all companies -- including Facebook, the world's largest social media platform -- must follow the law and respect consumers.</p><p>  ''We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising,'' Ms. James said.</p><p>  In a statement, Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy, said the company ''will work constructively with state attorneys general, and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.''</p><p>  A Google spokesman had a similar response. ''We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,'' he said.</p><p>  That state officials would  investigate Facebook and other big tech companies over antitrust and other issues had been expected, although the timing was unclear. The states' move follows similar steps by the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to examine how the companies have accumulated market power and whether they have acted to reduce competition. On Friday, Google disclosed to financial regulators that the Justice Department had requested documents related to past antitrust investigations into the company.</p><p>Congress is exploring the same questions. In July, executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple -- the four companies that are the focus of the Justice Department's review -- appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington. Another hearing is planned for next week.</p><p>  State regulators, typically acting in tandem with federal officials, can play an important role in major antitrust investigations. That was the case in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>  Unlike that case, the current antitrust issues extend well beyond a single company. The Justice Department, for example, is focused on companies that operate in, and have come to dominate, somewhat different markets, including internet search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks.</p><p>  For Facebook, the states' antitrust investigation puts the social media giant in regulators' cross hairs yet again.</p><p>  In July, the Federal Trade Commission voted to fine the company about $5 billion for mishandling users' personal information, the agency's largest fine ever against a tech company. Also in July, Facebook officials faced two days of grilling in Congress over a new cryptocurrency initiative called Libra.</p><p>  The state antitrust investigation into Facebook could move in many different directions.</p><p>  It might, for instance, align with the trade commission's inquiry, which is focused on whether the company used what Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder, and the prominent antitrust academics Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu have called a ''program of serial defensive acquisitions'' to maintain its dominance in the social-networking industry.</p><p>  In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, the photo-sharing network, for $1 billion. Two years later, it spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, a global-messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>  Critics like Mr. Hughes, Mr. Hemphill and Mr. Wu believe that long before either acquisition, Mark Zuckerberg, a founder of Facebook and its chief executive, kept a close eye on start-ups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>  As for Google, it escaped unscathed from a 21-month trade commission investigation that ended in 2013. The agency decided that the company did not violate antitrust laws in how it presented search results, despite often steering users to its own services, like shopping.</p><p>Google has received tougher treatment in Europe. In several antitrust investigations into its market behavior, Google has agreed to pay the European Union more than $8 billion in fines.</p><p>  In the United States, Google agreed this week to pay a $170 million fine and make changes to protect children's privacy on its YouTube video service. The settlement was reached with the trade commission and the office of Ms. James, New York's attorney general.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A new investigation has put Facebook in regulators' cross hairs yet again.

Apple is known for playing this role all the time.</p><p><br/> The company's latest move may finally legitimize digital currencies like Bitcoin and pave the way for widespread use.<br/> How so?\u00a0Earlier this month, at the Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple unveiled their newly revised guidelines[1] with an added section on digital currencies that aims to open the doors to digital currencies.<br/> The latest App store guidelines state[2] that, 'apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.'<br/> Keyword: approved.<br/> What does this mean for digital currencies like Bitcoin?<br/> It's not very clear, so clearCi's[3] software was used to scanned various blogs and news networks to dig deeper in hopes of sharing the love of intelligence.<br/> For starters, Apple has not provided a list of 'approved' virtual currencies, but there must be one in the making. Secondly, what digital currencies are in compliance with state and federal laws?<br/> In mid-November 2013, the first-ever US congressional hearings on virtual currencies took place. A number of US federal agencies, such as the Treasury Department, Justice Department and Secret Service, and US state banking agencies discussed the topic[4]. Although many seem to support the regulation of digital currencies, the final verdict still remains unknown.<br/> Similarly to the US, Europe is aware of its power but has not found ways to regulate digital currencies. The European Central Bank released a\u00a0study[5] concluding that 'authorities need to consider whether they intend to formalize or acknowledge and regulate these currencies.' In China, however, authorities have restricted the use of Bitcoin, seeing it as a potential threat to financial stability. Yet, despite how countries approach regulation, Bitcoin and other digital currencies continue to be traded heavily.<br/> The bottom line is this: Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are not 'approved' by any central bank and are traded in decentralized networks free from government control. So to answer the question, Apple's new updated regulation on virtual currency might indicate that Bitcoin and its cousins are still out of the game.<br/> So what is Apple's strategy behind the guideline changes?<br/> clearCi's competitive intelligence software found that text experts\u00a0speculated[6] that Apple switch its stand on digital currency only because it plans to introduce its own digital currency iMoney, for which it filed a\u00a0patent[7] last year.<br/> The tech giant wants to get into the digital currency game just like Amazon with their digital currency, Amazon Coins. Apple's patent is a combination of virtual currency and digital wallet technology. It will allow users to store money in the cloud and make payments through their iDevices.<br/> At first glance, it seemed easier to think that Apple was getting ready to open their doors to Bitcoin, but this didn't make sense considering that the App Store banned Bitcoin apps and demanded all apps to not facilitate Bitcoin payments. In February, the App Store removed the last remaining Bitcoin app, Blockchain.[8]\u00a0The move provoked widespread criticism across the blogosphere, and many believed it was anticompetitive.<br/> The Blockchain team wrote a sweet letter to Apple[9]. They stated that Apple removed them of their App Store because they see them as a threat.<br/> 'The Blockchain application is the same one that has been on the App Store for 2 years, with more than 120,000 downloads, no customer complaints, and a broad user base. The only thing that has changed is that Bitcoin has become competitive to Apple's own payment system. By removing the Blockchain app, the only Bitcoin wallet application on the App Store, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a heavy handed manner.'<br/> However, we can also argue that Apple removed Bitcoin apps and prohibited the usage of Bitcoin as payments in their store because of the unanswered questions behind their regulation.<br/> In the same month that Apple eliminated Blockchain from the App Store, Mt. Gox, Bitcoin's largest trading network, filed for bankruptcy[10]. The shocking loss of Bitcoins traded on Mt. Gox caused many people to question its power and legitimacy.<br/> Regardless of their reasoning, Apple might opt to play catch up with popular currency rival, as it seems they want to enter the virtual currency market after all. At the same time, they need to keep in mind that the App Store competitor, Google Play, is welcoming Coinbase and Bitcoin apps like Blockchain.<br/> Will Apple's reluctance to embrace Bitcoin hurt or benefit its App Store and ecosystem in the long-run?
