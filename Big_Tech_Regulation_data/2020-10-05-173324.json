The stealth tech stock rally in 2017 has been powered by the development of disruptive themes such as AI, blockchain, cloud computing, big data analytics, the sharing economy, machine learning and deep learning.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Little wonder, then, that global tech stocks have added a whopping US$2.45 trillion ($3.33 trillion) in market capitalisation over the past 12 months. Chinese tech firms alone have gained nearly US$320 billion in market value over the previous year. \u00a0</p><p>To be sure, tech is an overcrowded trade.\u00a0The tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 22% this year. Nvidia (in which Singapore's Creative Technology once had a 7.5% stake) is up 78% this year, giving it a market capitalisation of US$112 billion. Netflix's stock has risen 59% since January, Facebook has gained 50%, Apple 35%, Amazon 32% and Alphabet 26%. The Chinese tech players have done even better than their US counterparts: E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is up 110%, gaming and messaging giant Tencent Holdings 84% and search engine Baidu 57% over the past nine months.\u00a0</p><p>Valuations stretched</p><p>\"It is fair to say that overall valuations are a bit stretched, but we are in one of the longest business cycles in decades,\" Brent Thill, head of internet research for Jefferies &amp; Co in San Francisco and one of the top-rated tech analysts in the US, tells The Edge Singapore in a recent interview. \"As equities have done well, we have seen very strong outperformance by the tech leaders - the top five companies by value now are tech names,\" he notes. While he is concerned that some of the tech stocks may have surged too far too fast, Thill says any parallels with the dotcom bubble 17 years ago are wide of the mark. Back then, the Jefferies analyst recalls, \"stocks were massively overheated and had unproven business models\". Despite tech's big run this year, he notes, \"fundamentals remain very good\" and the market is very healthy. \"Alphabet, for example, trades fairly close to market multiples and its valuation still looks compelling,\" he says. \"Facebook is still growing 40% annually. None of the dotcom companies had the same characteristics. They could grow, but didn't have the profitability.\"\u00a0</p><p>Large internet platform companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google are disrupting multiple sectors, including retailing,\u00a0logistics, interactive gaming and video and filmed entertainment. Indeed, some, like Amazon, are so feared that 15% of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies specifically mentioned the e-commerce giant in their last quarterly earnings reports. Among the segments of the tech sector that look most promising are cloud, social media and e-commerce. The secular shift to digital, video, mobile and the way we consume services are driving the growth of internet stocks. \"Many traditional business models are cracking or collapsing as that shift takes place,\" notes Thill. \"We order things online rather than going out to malls, so Amazon benefits from the massive shift to e-commerce,\" he says, adding: \"My kids don't go to malls; they buy shoes online.\" The shift to video is almost as huge. \"My kids don't watch TV; they watch video on YouTube and Facebook.\"</p><p>Thill says video will be a huge driver of growth for internet companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon over the next five years. He expects digital video consumption to grow to 50% of time spent on video, from 20% currently,\u00a0within five years,\u00a0accelerating disruption of a US$200 billion global TV ad market, which should benefit Facebook, Google and Snap.</p><p>Thill notes that in the cloud arena, Amazon's AWS\u00a0and Goo\u00adgle Cloud are very well positioned, as is Microsoft, which has Azure. In social media, \"Facebook is running away with the \u00adcategory\", he says. \"Twitter\u00a0has kind of lost its way and is struggling, as is\u00a0Snap. Advertising is going mostly to proven players Google and Facebook,\" he adds. Snap and Twitter are in the experimental phase. \"Ultimately, I believe Snap will do better than Twitter,\" he says. \"Snap is the best way to play the explosion in millennial digital video consumption. It has growing pains, but it can make it to the other side.\"\u00a0</p><p>Thill's top three internet sector picks are Facebook,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and online travel site Expedia. Among the other large-cap names he likes is search engine giant Alphabet, whose shares\u00a0are trading at 12 times enterprise value to\u00a0Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation - in line with the S&amp;P 500.\u00a0</p><p>If he could recommend just one stock that investors should hold for three to five years, it would be Facebook, says Thill. He has a US$215 12-month price target, or 27% upside for the social media giant, the fastest-growing of the large internet players. \"Facebook is growing twice as fast as Google and faster than Amazon, so it has much more upside,\" he says .\"It has superior growth, superior margins and bigger barriers to entry\" among the large internet names, adds Thill. \"It connects consumers and advertisers globally with best-in-class data and is trading at 28 times next year's earnings,\" he notes. Facebook is projected to grow its earnings at more than 28% annually over the next three years.</p><p>Facebook's impact\u00a0</p><p>At the moment, 25% of the world is on the Facebook platform, according to Thill. \"Our view is that close to 40% of the world [or 3.5 billion monthly active users] could be on Facebook\u00a0within five years,\" he says. \"There are very few companies in the world that have Facebook's footprint and can make the kind of impact it can make.\" He forecasts over 50% growth for Facebook's average revenue per user by 2022. \"It is very difficult to replicate what Facebook is doing and advertisers are getting incredible ROI [return on investment]\", a key measurement for the ad industry. A lot of Facebook's growth is coming through its aggressive move into \u00advideo. \"Facebook is best positioned to continue to capture share in digital advertising, driving greater incremental video views,\" Thill says. Investors also have the optionality of eventual monetisation of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.\u00a0</p><p>Isn't Amazon, which is selling at over 120 times next year's forecast earnings, too expensive? Thill argues that \"Amazon actually looks undervalued on a growth-adjusted basis\" compared with online competitors and brick-and-mortar retailers. The way to look at Amazon is through the sum of its parts - its web services or AWS business, e-commerce and retailing, he says. By 2022, annual revenue from AWS will have grown to US$55 billion from US$17 billion this year. AWS is very sticky and makes up 10% of Amazon's revenues but 55% of its Ebitda, notes Thill. If AWS were eventually spun off, it could garner a valuation of at least US$300 billion, or two-thirds of Amazon's own current value, he estimates.</p><p>Though Amazon is said to be entering several new segments, including selling pharmaceuticals and starting a YouTube rival soon, Thill believes an important move to watch is the e-commerce behemoth's entry into the US$100 billion gaming market as it launches a new video game streaming service by 2020. \"Today, you can download music or movies, but in a couple of years, you will probably be able to download interactive video games on demand,\" he says. \"On my Echo Show, I can say: \"Alexa, I want to play this game or that game. Video gaming content can easily be pumped through the Amazon distribution system.\" Amazon's entry will help expand the market and gaming stocks such as Electronic Arts, which is up 47% this year, Activision Blizzard, which is up 70%, and Take-Two Interactive, which is up 105%.</p><p>Thill has a US$1,200 price target on \u00adAlphabet, or 21% upside from current levels. The stock trades at 23.6 times next year's estimated earnings.\u00a0\"I\u00a0think regulatory concerns around Goo\u00adgle are somewhat overblown and the company is underappreciated by investors,\" he says. He argues that Alphabet clearly has \"the right pieces in place to win the race to a US$1 trillion market capitalisation\" against rivals Apple and Amazon. Google's parent has consistently grown revenues at over 20% annually for the past seven years. \"It is the cheapest of the large internet stocks,\" notes Thill. Investors in Alphabet, aside from their exposure to the search giant,\u00a0he argues, \"are getting multiple call options with YouTube, Google Cloud as well as autonomous driving through Waymo\". He adds: \"A fourth catalyst could be around hardware.\" Alphabet, which sells Nest thermostats, smoke detectors and security cameras, recently bought the smartphone assets of Taiwanese firm HTC for US$1.1 billion. It also sells several versions of Google Home, the smart home speaker and rival of Amazon's Echo and Apple's soon-to-be-launched HomePod. \"Goo\u00adgle has a dominant market share through [smartphone operating system] Android that I believe it can leverage into another profitable business by integrating software and services with its own hardware,\" he says.</p><p>Online travel</p><p>Aside from the big tech players, the Jefferies analyst likes the online travel segment of the internet. Total annual travel spend globally\u00a0is US$1.3 trillion currently and online travel is roughly half of that\u00a0(US$613 billion), but at a 9% annual clip, it is growing nearly five times as fast as global travel spending. However, unlike other segments of the internet where there is a tendency for winner-takes-all and\u00a0large players get stronger while smaller ones become weaker, there is no clear leader in online travel. Priceline Group and Expedia are both very well positioned in the business, Thill argues.</p><p>He is also bullish on Match Group, owner of online dating site Tinder.\u00a0Investors, he argues, should swipe right on online dating. \"We think 50% of first dates will begin online by 2022,\" he says. He notes that 95% of Match's revenues are through subscriptions and the company is forecast to grow sales 15% this year. The stock trades\u00a0at just 10 times Ebitda and is one of the most profitable companies on the internet, with a 28%\u00a0margin. Match's stock trades at just over 20 times next year's forecast earnings.</p><p>Thill believes the internet stock rally still has legs and as the tech sector's quarterly earnings come through over the next few weeks, they will further reaffirm investors' enthusiasm for high-growth, large tech names. \"The big internet players will only keep getting bigger, as scale creates significant competitive moats,\" says Thill. Moreover, as the internet giants gain access to more data, they will be the main beneficiaries of AI, the Internet of Things, autonomous cars and smart homes, themes which will help power the next rally.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PRJ-W481-JCF0-335H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Crucially, I wonder if this is not the turning point in terms of regulation for many big tech companies, an industry that has thus far thrived with minimal oversight. Are digital disruptors about to be more regulated?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up, I disposed of all of my Facebook shares and a quarter of my holdings in DIP Corp.</p><p>I made a big investment in DIP, double the typical amount I would invest per stock and it has paid off. Its shares have performed well, rising as high as \u00a53,550 just prior to the global market selldown. Therefore, I have decided to gradually normalise my investment in the stock and also to lock in some profits.</p><p>The company reported a good set of earnings results for the latest quarter ended November 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the quarter were up an outsized 27% y-o-y compared with the 14% revenue growth on the back of improving margins.</p><p>In fact, this underlines the basis for my upbeat outlook for tech companies - the benefits of the network effect, limited supply constraints for those with digital-focused businesses and long-term marginal cost that approaches zero.</p><p>What could upset this apple cart? Regulatory challenges.</p><p>Government scrutiny in the US and EU - especially as it pertains to the collection and protection of a vast trove of personal information - has been on the rise, but never more intense as the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election unfolds.</p><p>In particular, lawmakers are examining the role of social media platforms in the dissemination of fake news and, this week, the revelation of how a British-based data analytics company misused the personal data of up to 50 million Facebook users to influence the election.</p><p>Facebook is at the forefront of this regulatory backlash - and may well be the first to feel the real impact of any legislative fallout. The stock was heavily sold down after news of the data misuse came to light. I believe this selldown is justified. The impact of the resulting regulations will have a significant impact on Facebook's revenue and profits.</p><p>For those of you who remember, it was the US government that forced the break-up of AT&amp;T (affectionately known as Ma Bell) in 1984, then the world's largest telco monopoly. It, too, was benefiting from the network effect and appeared then to be in an insurmountable position.</p><p>I bought Facebook shares because they offered the best value and the company has the best business model among the big tech companies. Revenue growth is strong and margins are holding up. Marginal costs are minimal, unlike for Amazon.com and Alphabet, which are spending heavily on new investments, including physical assets that will drive down returns on equity.</p><p>All these are still true. But given the rising regulatory and legal risks, I have decided to cut my losses. Nevertheless, I still believe that tech companies are reasonably valued relative to their prospective growth. Hence, I am reinvesting proceeds from the sale of Facebook into shares in Amazon and Alphabet, both of which are household names that require little introduction.</p><p>Amazon is the largest e-commerce player in the US, though most of its profits currently come from the cloud computing business. The company is also investing big in physical stores, warehouses and distribution logistics. I think their biggest promise is in creating a new home ecosystem. I will explain more on this in the future.</p><p>Alphabet, meanwhile, derives most of its revenue and earnings from advertising. It has numerous platforms with a huge user base, including YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome and Android, plus big side bets on AI and autonomous cars.</p><p>I also acquired about US$50,000 ($65,623) worth of shares in G8 Education, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is the country's second-largest operator of day care and education centres for children aged below five. Most of its 495 centres are located in New South Wales and Victoria, with another 21 in Singapore.</p><p>G8 has grown its Ebitda at an impressive annual pace of 37% up until 2017 on improving margins. Last year, growth stalled, owing to increased competition, and its share price fell sharply in response.</p><p>I believe G8's outlook will improve this year, underpinned by mature contributions from the 58 centres acquired in 2016 and 2017. The company also undertook refurbishment and improvement works at many of its centres last year as well as staff upskilling to meet more stringent regulatory requirements. G8 benefits from economies of scale, including from procurement, staff training and placements.</p><p>In addition, the government's new Child Care Subsidy (that will come into effect in July 2018) will raise subsidies for low-middle income families, which should in turn boost demand for childcare services.</p><p>The company generates positive free cash flow and distributes 75% of its annual profits as dividends. At current prices, that will give shareholders an estimated yield of over 6%. Its shares are trading at only nine times trailing EV/Ebitda and 15 times price-to-earnings ratio (see Charts 1 and 2).</p><p>After taking into account all the above transactions, cash in the Global Portfolio was reduced to about 16% of total portfolio value.</p><p>The Global Portfolio is now up 7.3% since inception and continues to outperform the benchmark index, which is up 0.6% over the same period.</p><p>Meanwhile, I continued to reduce my exposure for the Malaysian Portfolio. My cash holdings have now increased to RM91,477 ($30,722), or about 28% of total portfolio value.</p><p>As I have said previously, my recent disposals were driven by macro considerations and not stock-specific ones. The aim is to be prudent and raise some cash that will give us more room to manoeuvre once the global markets stabilise.</p><p>Table 1 shows select emerging market index and currency movements since the global selloff. Notably, countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, China and Mexico have suffered more than their fair share of pain in the equity selloff, while most emerging market currencies too have depreciated against the US dollar over this period.</p><p>Increased market volatility usually results in investors turning more risk-averse and pulling money out of perceived riskier emerging markets. In addition, many emerging economies are still heavily dependent on exports and are therefore weighed down by rising concerns of a brewing trade war.</p><p>Tong Kooi Ong is chairman of The Edge \u00adMedia Group, which owns The Edge Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYX-WNW1-DYX1-T00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Jan Schakowsky of Illinois during a hearing that featured testimony from a Facebook executive  FB, +1.01%[1] and policy experts. 'Congress has, unfortunately, taken a laissez-faire approach to regulation of unfair and deceptive practices online over the last decade, and platforms have let them flourish. The result is Big Tech failed to respond to the grave threats posed by deepfakes, as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to announce a new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate.' 'Deepfake' videos are false but realistic clips created with artificial intelligence and other high-tech tools. Facebook said late Monday that it was banning such videos. See: Facebook bars 'deepfake' videos to fight online manipulation[2]  'I'm concerned that Facebook's latest effort to address misinformation on the platforms leaves a lot out,' Shakowsky said, as she spoke during a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer protection. The hearing[3] was titled 'Americans at Risk: Manipulation and Deception in the Digital Age.' The congresswoman, who chairs the subcommittee, emphasized that the social-media giant's new policy only covers video that has been manipulated with AI or deep learning. She grilled Facebook executive Monika Bickert on the point that a manipulated clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral last year 'wouldn't have been taken down under the new policy.' 'It would not fall under that policy, but it would still be subject to our other policies that address misinformation,' said Bickert, who is the company's vice president of global policy management. See: Facebook's Bickert defends company's approach to doctored Pelosi video[4] Facebook's Monika Bickert is shown at a Capitol Hill hearing last year. She was back on the Hill on Wednesday.A raft of bills aimed at technology companies  FDN, +0.90%[5] were introduced in Congress in 2019, addressing privacy, censorship, security, algorithms, facial recognition, children's issues and other matters. But Capital Alpha Partners analysts have said the 'existence of so many disparate critiques complicates making progress on any one issue.' The Trump administration's Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched antitrust investigations into Big Tech.

Debbie Dingell of Michigan released a letter[8] that she has sent to the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in which she asks him to detail what Facebook is doing to stop misinformation about the U.S.-Iran conflict.

Amazon  AMZN, -0.24%[2] has reported spending $16.1 million in 2019 vs. $14.4 million a year ago, and Apple said it put forth $7.4 million, topping its 2018 outlay of $6.7 million and its 2017 total of $7.2 million.

Netflix disclosed shelling out $850,000 last year, up from $800,000 in 2018 but below its 2015 total of $1.3 million. Google spent $11.8 million last year, down sharply from its 2018 total of $21.7 million as the search heavyweight reorganized its lobbying effort. The spending \u2014 which already was on a record pace for some companies after last year's third quarter[6] \u2014 has come as Big Tech increasingly finds itself in lawmakers and regulators' cross hairs. A raft of bills aimed at technology companies were introduced in Congress in 2019, addressing privacy, censorship, security, algorithms, children's issues, facial recognition and other matters. But Capital Alpha Partners analysts have said the 'existence of so many disparate critiques complicates making progress on any one issue.'  In addition, the Trump administration's Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched antitrust investigations into Big Tech. An Amazon spokeswoman on Wednesday said the e-commerce titan is 'always looking for ways to innovate' for customers, and its Washington, D.C., team is 'focused on ensuring we are advocating on issues that are important to our customers, our employees and policy makers.' A Facebook spokesman declined to comment, while Apple, Netflix and Google didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Facebook's FB, 0.50%[2] filing for the past quarter[3] shows it lobbied on a wide range of issues, including blockchain policy, election integrity, data security, internet competition, high-tech worker visas, privacy legislation, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and bullying prevention. The Silicon Valley company in recent months has faced scrutiny in particular over Libra, its blockchain-based cryptocurrency, and Zuckerberg is expected to get asked about Libra on Wednesday, as the House committee's hearing is slated to focus on Facebook's impact on financial services and the housing sector. See: Zuckerberg to testify Libra's launch to be delayed until U.S. regulators OK currency[4]  And read: Zuckerberg unveils Facebook's new security measures to combat 2020 election interference[5]  'We see the Libra project compounding political pressure on the company, amplifying privacy and antitrust concerns and enabling more opposition,' said Robert Kaminski, a Capital Alpha Partners analyst, in a note. 'We expect questions on Visa V, -0.02%[6] , Mastercard MA, 0.20%[7] and PayPal's PYPL, -1.40%[8] decision to withdraw from the project, lending credibility to lawmakers skeptical of the project's viability and ulterior motivations.' Read more: Facebook's Libra battered by defections, pushback[9]  Opinion: Facebook's Libra unravels, and for good reason[10]  Amazon.com Inc.  AMZN, -1.04%[11] wasn't far behind Facebook with $4 million in lobbying spending in this year's third quarter, according to its disclosure from late Monday[12]. Both companies are staying on track to set new annual records in their outlays to influence Washington, as shown in the chart below. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG, 0.42%[13] GOOGL, 0.51%[14] Google business \u2014 which has been reducing its outlays this year and reorganizing its lobbying effort[15] amid growing scrutiny \u2014 disclosed spending $2.8 million[16] from July 1 through Sept. 30. Apple Inc. AAPL, 1.02%[17] said it shelled out $1.8 million[18], and Netflix Inc.  NFLX, 1.18%[19] said it spent a relatively modest $200,000[20]. The lobbying comes as Big Tech deals with antitrust probes, and as some politicians say the Silicon Valley titans should get broken up[21]. In the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data[22] harvesting scandal and other foul-ups, the companies are also facing greater scrutiny over how they handle their users' data as well as how they manage misinformation and political bias. Lawmakers have talked up the potential for a bipartisan law that would lead to better safeguards for personal data, though analysts say it's unlikely because of a partisan split[23] over the potential for federal preemption of states' laws. Capital Alpha analysts 'have been less worried about antitrust risk in the near-to-medium term,' Kaminski said. 'In our view, the early federal 'investigation' headlines and investor reaction overstate the imminence and impact. We don't believe the government knows what they're looking for, what the problem is, nor what the solution would be.' Related: 4 reasons why antitrust actions probably will fail to break up Big Tech[24]  Opinion: The Big Tech antitrust investigation may be a political game, but that doesn't mean it will end quickly[25]  Facebook's third-quarter lobbying spending of $4.8 million comes after the company shelled out $4.1 million in the second quarter[26], and the outlay easily tops the company's spending of $2.82 million in 2018's third quarter[27]. Facebook's stock has gained 39% this year, Amazon has advanced 18%, and Apple is up 52%. Netflix has pulled back less than 1%, while Google is higher by 20%. The S...00 SPX, -0.13%[28] has added 20%.

The bill also would allow users to designate third-party services to manage their privacy and account settings. 'As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry,' said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia in a press release[1]. He is sponsoring the legislation with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. 'By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies,' Warner added. 'And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies.' Related: Want to delete Facebook? Read what happened to these people first[2]  The senators' measure has drawn support from some experts, such as Nobel-winning economist Paul Romer[3]. 'We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return,' Romer said in the lawmakers' press release. Mandating portability will give people 'a realistic option of switching to another provider,' he added. The bill's lengthy full name is the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act. Facebook Inc.'s  FB, -3.91%[4] third-quarter disclosure[5] on its lobbying efforts shows that it aimed to influence lawmakers and regulators on 'data portability and interoperability,' among many other issues. In a white paper released month[6], Facebook laid out the challenges of letting users take their data to other platforms. The company already needs to comply with new laws in California and the European Union that require that it make social-media profiles easily transferable.

Behind it all, of course, is a powerful force: Google, which aggressively deploys its vast wealth to make sure that creators get a raw deal, and Googlegets a good one.</p><p>An application for costs before the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission in respect of the \"FairPlay Canada\" initiative is a perfect case in point. FairPlay is an attempt by more than 25 Canadian media companies, including Telus, Rogers, Shaw and Bell, to get the CRTC to set up a process to block websites that exist for the purpose of pirating television shows and other video content. But the CRTC declined to help on jurisdictional grounds, determining that it lacked power under the Telecommunications Act, but that FairPlay could pursue other legal avenues.</p><p>Among the groups contributing to the fight for piracy and against Fair-Play were Vancouver-based OpenMedia and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa. Open Media and CIPPIC now seek to collect from FairPlay its costs for fighting FairPlay's request to the CRTC - a grand total of $16,144.50. It's not much, but consider the principle: Open Media says it should get the money for defending the public interest. By protecting pirates? By spreading misinformation about FairPlay? That's rich.</p><p>CIPPIC meanwhile, portrays itself as a public interest law clinic. Both it and OM receive money from Google. Of course, organizations don't necessarily toe the line of any particular sponsor. But it's curious how often their positions tend to overlap.</p><p>Open Media is the same organization that was behind a dodgy email campaign that recently targeted Canada's NAFTA negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland: Open Media created an online form letter that allowed a single person to spam the minister with a limitless number of emails. The ministry was hit with an avalanche of 22,000 emails from that web form, most of them likely bogus. Naturally they all claimed to be grassroots Canadians worried about losing \"digital rights\" - meaning rules that protect Big Tech corporations.</p><p>Open Media also played a huge role in delaying the recently passed European copyright directive, by using automated email forms and robocalls to deluge EU delegates with misinformation and create a false sense of grassroots opposition. All this to stop an EU directive that may finally help put artist's rights back into the balance.</p><p>American musician David Lowery, who has been fighting for artists'rights, has called out Open Media for underhanded tactics. Lowery, founder of alternative rock bands Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, wrote: \"this sort of spamming activity by the likes of Open Media seems designed to overwhelm the channels through which ordinary constituents communicate with government officials. It drowns out the voices of ordinary citizens, and replaces them with robotic corporate and special interest crafted messages.\"</p><p>Similar tactics used by Open Media's commercial affiliate, NewMode.net, played a role in the defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership IP provisions as well as the stalling of the EU copyright directive. (Shockingly, the Canadian government, through its office of the Privacy Commissioner, has actually provided funding to Open Media.)</p><p>If Google's interests seem to benefit a lot from its financial support for Open Media, it doesn't stop there. The scent of Google's paid influence is finally being picked up in all kinds of important places. In a recent court case in the United States, a judge required interveners claiming to represent the public interest to disclose whether they had been funded by Google. They had. And the GoogleTransparency Project, run by the non-profit Campaign for Accountability, and The Wall Street Journal have publicized the extravagant number of intellectual property law academics funded by Googlein Europe and the Americas. According to the Journal's reporting, for instance, Googlehas provided financing for hundreds of research papers defending it from regulatory incursion or other costs.</p><p>So this is the alarming situation we face now.</p><p>Google's power and money is being deployed to promote views and sometimes even misinformation that benefit Googlethrough a wide network of academics, lawyers and advocacy groups. Yet Googleis an organization that does nothing so much as broker information. Is it wise or proper to allow any company to purchase its own terms for the integrity with which it treats others'information? Google's interests with regard to its \"digital rights\" efforts are most neatly viewed through the activities of its YouTube arm. YouTube is the largest online distributor of music and other content, legitimate and pirated, but notoriously pays a pittance to the artists from whose work it benefits. Meanwhile, YouTube remains open for stream-ripping software that can pirate music directly from the site.</p><p>Googleand other social media companies have grown fat and powerful under shelter provided by unjustly favourable laws. It now uses its power to try to enlarge that shelter rather than meeting the needs of the artists and creators on whose efforts its platform depends. (The latest favour from policy-makers to Big Tech was a provision in the new NAFTA deal that granted internet companies immunity from legal action on user-posted content; how did that get in there?) At least now the tide is beginning to turn. Open Media's efforts were defeated in Europe and legislators there said that they were particularly influenced by disgust at the tactics of the technology industry.</p><p>The University of Ottawa's Michael Geist has attacked me for my criticisms of the Open Media. He claims, without any basis, that I am a lobbyist for somebody or other. In fact, I am independent and I truly am only interested in representing the public interest.</p><p>Meanwhile, other groups out there are taking Google's money while also claiming to represent the public interest. More and more decisionmakers and legislators are starting to realize that it just isn't possible to do both.</p><p>Richard C.

Some of the world\u2019s biggest oil traders and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/hedge-fund-strategies\"> hedge fund</url> managers now appear to believe it.</p><p>In the past four\u00a0months, the price of European carbon allowances \u2014 tradable securities that dictate how much it costs power stations and industry in Europe to emit a tonne of carbon dioxide \u2014 have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab7abf9f-d05a-4c0c-85d8-96a4c0727603\"> soared to a near record high</url> above \u20ac30. In turn they have raised the cost of polluting for businesses such as electricity utilities and will soon do so for manufacturers of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/457ca4db-e050-466f-ab51-b205b42f2a47\"> products like cement and steel</url>.</p><p>To veterans of the niche carbon trading industry, which was established 15 years ago, the price rise made little sense. Coronavirus lockdowns and the resulting deep global recession have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c59fd16-6020-4798-b8f1-5df686bbd97a\"> cut emissions across Europe</url> as factories have slowed and power demand has fallen. Prices should, they argue, be going down not up.</p><p>But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bb3bde5-3cdd-4551-a5be-29ddf0b2cf98\"> the market is evolving</url>, attracting a new breed of trader who cares less for short-term factors such as whether the market is oversupplied this year. Instead, they see an opportunity to cash in on a market whose direction will ultimately be dictated by politics and support for a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d after the pandemic.</p><p>\u201cBy\u00a02022 the EU carbon price could easily reach \u20ac40,\u201d says Florian Rothenberg at commodities consultancy ICIS. \u201cBut if financial investors and speculators believe this the\u00a0price could easily reach much higher.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Renewed interest in the EU carbon market could have significant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b499932c-9d91-11e9-b8ce-8b459ed04726\"> ramifications for European industry</url>. At about \u20ac25 a tonne, the carbon price is already high enough to have started to push coal off the electricity grid, with utilities switching to less-polluting natural gas or carbon-free renewables.</p><p>The next stage, traders suspect, is for the carbon price to rise high enough\u00a0\u2014 between \u20ac40 and \u20ac50 a tonne \u2014 to start forcing other sectors\u00a0to invest in cleaner technology and fuels \u2014 good for the environment, but a seismic change for industry, the impact of which is not yet fully understood.</p><p>Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand is regarded in the industry as one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/551c8ffb-dfd3-45c0-a7bf-e04ada94a6e9\"> most successful oil traders</url> of his generation. After returning investors a profit of more than 150 per cent in the first five months of the year by betting successfully against the oil price, he is now diverting a small portion of his $600m fund\u00a0in to carbon.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable over a five-year horizon that the price has to go up \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much a guarantee,\u201d Mr Andurand says. \u201cAs long as the EU maintains this commitment to fighting climate change and utilising the carbon market, we\u2019re confident prices will rise.\u201d</p><p>Investors flocking</p><p>He is not alone. Vitol, the world\u2019s largest independent energy trader, is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its\u00a0five-strong\u00a0carbon team. And in a sign of how important it believes the market will become, it has appointed the former head of European gas \u2014 one of its main money-spinners outside its core oil operations \u2014 to run the business.</p><p>Some of the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds like Brevan Howard and Citadel are also said by rival traders to be playing more of a role, while banks such as Morgan Stanley, Macquarie and Citi have been steadily building their teams, looking to profit both from increased client activity and in-house trading. </p><p>Insurers and pension funds are also reported\u00a0to be taking a bigger interest\u00a0as a potential hedge against climate-related parts of their portfolios.</p><p>For Erik Petersson, senior managing director in\u00a0Macquarie group\u2019s commodities and global markets team in London, the renewed interest in carbon from investors is a natural reaction to the signals from politicians. </p><p>In the face of a deep recession, the EU has not wavered in its commitment to tackle climate change despite the associated costs, if anything redoubling its efforts to cut emissions across the continent. Its revised aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en\"> 50-55 per cent by 2030</url> from 1990 levels, up from the current target of 40 per cent.</p><p>\u201cThe market has attracted some new attention over the last 12-24 months due to policymaking announcements for 2030-2050 where the EU is setting carbon goals,\u201d Mr Petersson says. \u201cThey are some time away but they are painting a picture of a stronger carbon price essentially required to meet these targets.\u201d</p><p>Expectations of where the price may eventually settle\u00a0vary widely. But in more than a dozen interviews with hedge funds, banks and investors active in the sector, not one said that they believed prices would fall significantly. The only differences were in how far they might rise, over what timeframe and how big the political risk might be should the mood in Brussels change.</p><p>For much of European industry, which has spent decades worrying about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/oil\"> oil and other fuel prices</url> as one of their main production costs, this requires a dramatic shift in mindset. With oil prices looking likely to remain relatively manageable in the next few years, with plenty of supply available below $60 a barrel, the carbon price may well end up having a much greater impact on their fortunes, especially if the EU cuts the number of credits or \u201cfree\u201d European emission allowances (EUAs) available to industry.</p><p>\u201cThe carbon mechanism is already pushing out thermal generation and the next carbon abatement is likely to come from the industrial sector,\u201d Mr Petersson says. \u201cFor them to reduce their carbon emissions and encourage investment you need to see a much higher\u00a0carbon price.\u201d</p><p>EU leverage</p><p>Traders estimate the price may need to double to about \u20ac50 a tonne in the coming years to have the full impact the EU intends. They compare\u00a0the situation in the EU emissions trading system, or ETS, to the oil market at the start of this century, when a handful of investors spotted that a decade of under investment in new production and China\u2019s rapid rise meant prices were going to have to go up.</p><p>Despite some volatile swings along the way, these trades ultimately made a fortune as crude prices rose from $30 a barrel in 2003 to $147 on the eve of the financial crisis.</p><p>But the comparison is not exact. The difference in the carbon market is that the EU essentially holds all the levers of supply, writing the rules and deciding how many EU carbon allowances, or credits, to release \u2014 or absorb \u2014 to influence the price over time. It has been compared to a supercharged Opec, where rather than controlling roughly a third of supply, as the cartel does in the global oil market, the EU ultimately controls it all.</p><p>That is not to say it isn\u2019t a real market. In the short term buyers and sellers often respond to the usual signals of supply and demand. If the economy slows and emissions go down, more participants are likely to sell, as seen this spring when coronavirus curbed demand and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d73bf856-6730-418b-8faa-1ec64cc58a1b\"> prices dropped almost 40 per cent</url> from \u20ac26 to \u20ac16 a tonne.</p><p>If the price falls too much \u2014 or potentially rises too high \u2014 the EU has the ability to tighten or loosen supplies through the \u201cmarket stability reserve\u201d, or MSR, which was launched in 2019 to in effect reset the market after it had languished under the weight of excess supply built up during the financial crisis.</p><p>Nima Neelakandan, head of environmental products trading at Morgan\u00a0Stanley in London, says that what is happening with prices is an attempt by the market to \u201cfind a new equilibrium\u201d driven by a fundamental shift in expectations for the EU\u2019s climate ambitions. Those ambitions are now very often echoed by companies, from Big Oil to Big Tech, which are attempting to respond to investor calls to do more on climate change.</p><p>\u201cHow much emissions do we want to reduce by 2030 and then 2050 has become the debate and these are very long-term goals, so the market is trying to rebalance itself,\u201d Mr Neelakandan says. \u201cThe policy\u00a0direction and ambition has become a lot clearer. And it's not just the ambition\u00a0of the EU but corporates globally.\u201d</p><p>The crunch moment\u00a0is expected\u00a0next year. The ETS covers about 45 per cent of emissions in the bloc, primarily from utilities and big industrial\u00a0companies.\u00a0But it is likely to add more\u00a0sectors such as shipping under its remit while cutting the distribution of free credits,\u00a0increasing demand for allowances\u00a0and in theory driving up the price.</p><p>\u201cThe EU wants to include more sectors and it wouldn\u2019t do that if it didn\u2019t believe the EU ETS had been a success so far,\u201d Mr Neelakandan says. \u201cThat's all playing into the recent price action.\u201d</p><p>There is, however, some disquiet in sections of the EU that carbon could become a one-way bet for speculators. And that the real-world impacts from a price that rises too fast could range\u00a0from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df61210-3ecb-490e-8959-4822e1b1b56a\"> shutting coal plants in Poland</url> to placing additional levies on European industry at a time when pandemic-hit economies are already weak.</p><p>The thought of hedge funds or banks getting rich off carbon while other industries struggle sits uneasily with some politicians, even if they back the longer-term goal of making <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d150d3d-9b10-4e94-990a-7d2dad1666f6\"> the cost of polluting more expensive</url>.</p><p>\u201cSome people might be betting on increased climate ambition in the EU, but you want the EUA price to reflect market decisions rather than speculator ones,\u201d Bas Eickhout, the Dutch Greens MEP, told Carbon Pulse, an industry publication, in July. </p><p>Nimble traders</p><p>When Peter Krembel joined <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/a65c0c79-036c-4d46-bbe5-0d25debaed48\"> RWE</url> \u2014 one of Europe\u2019s biggest utilities and polluters \u2014 in 1999, its trading arm was treated as an afterthought by a company comfortably earning steady revenues from its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3217312-2854-4617-89a3-744ba768c2a6\"> fleet of coal-fired power stations</url> and gas and nuclear plants.</p><p>\u201cI was placed in this third-tier operation,\u201d says Mr Krembel,\u00a0now chief commercial officer for RWE\u2019s supply and trading division. \u201cStuck down in the basement of the headquarters, we were an appendix at best.\u201d</p><p>Two decades on his unit employs\u00a01,600\u00a0people and feeds into every facet of the company\u2019s strategy, essentially serving as an alchemist for the broader group. It has turned an unprofitable coal business into the basis of a carbon trading machine that can help smooth RWE\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecdf1231-93d6-4819-a32a-a49a7a25fcea\"> transition to a cleaner company</url>. </p><p>RWE has in recent times\u00a0bought up enough carbon credits to fully hedge its exposure to the carbon price for the next three years. It is an example of how carbon has forced companies to become more nimble, requiring fleet-footed trading to source cleaner supplies for customers, while also boosting profits with additional speculative positions. The trading arm, which also covers electricity, gas and other fuels, made a third of the company\u2019s \u20ac2.1bn in adjusted earnings in 2019.</p><p>Mr Krembel argues that curbs on carbon trading would lead to a distortion in the \u201cprice signals\u201d companies need, to make the right investment decisions.</p><p>\u201cThose markets need to be well organised and well regulated, but then the composition of market participants is not a concern of ours,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe need the depth and liquidity additional participants in these markets bring. A market should not be an in-crowd of utilities \u2014 that is poisonous to the wider industry.\u201d</p><p>Others argue the claim that dozens of funds are driving up the price is overblown. Energy Aspects, a consultancy, said in July\u00a0that the limited data\u00a0available on positions suggested most of the buying seen in recent months was coming from utilities and other industrial end users, rather than funds.</p><p>\u201cIf the carbon price is going to have a significant impact on emissions, you need a high price \u2014 probably \u20ac50 a tonne plus,\u201d says one hedge fund manager active in carbon markets. \u201cFor now it\u2019s mainly being driven by compliance buyers whose perspective has become, \u2018well if you could easily see \u20ac50 carbon we better buy it now as it's not going to get significantly cheaper\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Others question the role of the EU and whether it needs to step back from the market to allow trading to fully mature. \u201cThe supply side is completely fixed by the EU \u2014 what they decide to change happens,\u201d says Tom Lord, a trader at Redshaw Advisors. \u201cWhen it\u2019s so politically driven, it\u2019s not necessarily a good thing for the market.\u201d</p><p>Market growth</p><p>While some funds may be taking a long-term view of the price, other energy traders are going further. Michael Curran,\u00a0head of emissions trading at Vitol, says the goal is to grow in a market they see developing along the same lines as the physical oil market, with arbitrage, storage and logistics trades.</p><p>While they too expect the EU carbon price to rise, they believe non-exchange traded products such as carbon offsets \u2014 like planting forestry \u2014 may be the biggest growth area.</p><p>\u201cThe opportunity in European carbon credits might be a three times or five times price increase over the coming years,\u201d says Mr Curran. \u201cBut if [the price of] EUAs\u00a0rise it is going to bring up other carbon products like offsets, and the opportunity there might be price growth of 10 to 20 times over the same timeframe.\u201d</p><p>Mr Rothenberg, at ICIS, says traders are waking up to the implications of the EU\u2019s long-term aims. \u201cIt looks like a good investment,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially if you've got the backing of the EU.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a5ff89ec323c4fb885a19d0225ae3cdb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60ND-X7D1-DXP9-94B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2187\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 23, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Data retention involved explaining dullish things such as call records and technical standards, countering the deceptive official arguments that metadata was not really sensitive data at all.All these elements make it difficult to grasp the significance of state and corporate data surveillance, benignly presented as a way of providing better services or preventing crime.And that's exactly what states and corporations rely on, sometimes with an exploitative agenda but equally out of genuine ignorance. Something seems like a great idea and is pursued without having anyone with the requisite skills or knowledge consider the data privacy ramifications or the legality.</p><h>Mission creep The Public Services Card has all the hallmarks of just such a project. Initially conceived as a limited card within a single department, in recent years the </h><p>project bloated into a cross-department identification card. This is a well-recognised phenomenon of attempted normalisation, called \"mission creep\".</p><p>Yesterday Doherty told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland that while the departments had the highest respect for the regulator (cough), it would appeal its findings against the card. The departments would continue to refuse to publish the commission's report, or the department's legal advice that the regulator was acting outside its legal remit. Bizarrely, she even argued that withdrawing the card would be unlawful.Numerous data experts have challenged all these points. Barrister and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland TJ McIntyre posted on Twitter: \"This is an unprecedented situation in which a Government department (and serial data protection offender) simply refuses to respect the decisions of the regulator.\"Previous data protection commissioner Billy Hawkes had highlighted serious problems and breaches in the Department of Social Welfare, and in 2010 his office explicitly warned against casually putting together three ultra-sensitive personal identifiers in such a vulnerable location.\"We would be concerned that the inclusion of a photograph, a signature and a number such as the PPSN on the cards could serve for the card to be considered to be a de facto national ID card,\" a spokesman said. All three are on the current Public Services Card.</p><h>Introduction of an identity card is a major shift in public policy that needs D</h><p>\u00e1il and civil society debate - before, not after, the fact.The regulator's job is to enforce EU-level data protection laws that protect citizens. The State's refusal to recognise a ruling, while also failing to release the report or its legal defence to the Irish people, is state arrogance at its most disturbing.None of this engenders public trust, or sets a good tone for Ireland's role as the main European regulator of big tech.The taxpayer picks up the bill on both sides, too, because taxes ultimately will fund the departments' challenges, and the regulator's defence of same.</p><p>The debacle is boiling down to the exact same and sorry overreach concerns involved in the failed data retention policy: state secrecy, misdirection, denial, delay.</p><p>And where did that end up? Before the European Court of Justice, which, in a rare action, threw out the entire EU Data Retention Directive in 2014.</p><p>It seems the Public Services Card is now on that same journey to an inevitable slapdown in the courts - at all our expense.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4008297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X03-0KX1-DYS1-03XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This is part of a set of new initiatives taken by the government to promote innovation in the financial services sector.The Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it aims for relevant revisions to be made to existing regulations to enable new services to be offered next year at the earliest.Tech firms such as Naver offer easy payment services, through which users can make payments by charging money to their accounts or using credit cards.Under the model the government has approved, users of Naver Pay will not only be able to make payments using cash stored in their accounts, but be able to make up to 300,000 won in additional payments even if they do not hold the money in their account. </p><p>The money will be paid back later. This is essentially the credit business of card issuers. The limit has been set at 300,000 won, which may not seem high, but card firms state that the cap will likely be raised over time.\"What holds greater significance than the limit is the fact that the government has enabled tech firms to start a credit business,\" an official of a card firm said.\"Based on the government's stance of fostering fintech services, it is likely that the limit will be raised.\"More players in the credit business means card firms may lose dominance in the market.Lighter regulations for tech players are also considered a problem, as this may lead to financial soundness issues that could affect financial consumers.Card issuers are governed by the credit financial business act, while tech companies must follow the electronic financial transaction act, which is more lax in its regulation of financial services.\"Banks and card firms manage risks according to knowledge built from decades of experience and according to regulations,\" the official said.\"But for fintech entities, different regulations are applied. This exposes financial customers to potential risks.'Card firms also state applying different regulations is unfair.\"It is only fair that entities assuming the same business receive equal treatment,\" the official said.Authorities have pledged to address the issue of unequal treatment and also establish a system to ensure consumer protection, such as by making tech firms set up a bad debt provision.\"We will manage business' financial soundness and also come up with a system to protect financial consumers,\" the FSC said.The government's unveiling of plans come at a time when big tech firms are taking strides into the financial services sector. Their competitive edge is their platforms which attract massive amounts of traffic. Naver and Kakao also hold large pools of data as e-commerce platforms. The companies are quickly expanding and diversifying the financial services they offer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FV-P6S1-DYTP-W0NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Electronic Banking Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODQ4RjlEQkM4MTJDNDY3MTg3N0ZDNUMwQkY4OEI5OTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Thank you.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, CARDTRONICS PLC: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our, I think it's actually the company's first Investor Day. We're really glad that you're here and we're actually quite excited to share with you the story that what all we have been working on for the last 1.5 years. What I'm going to do is kind of kick off and walk through the agenda and then kind of introduce the team that you're going to be hearing from.</p><p>Joining me today with the company is our entire executive team. Frankly, our whole team is relatively new over the last 2 years in the company. I'm going to kick off and go through a strategic overview of what we've been focused on, what we see ahead of us and what that will mean to all of us as owners of the company.</p><p>Then I'm going to turn it over to Brian Bailey. Brian joined us about 2 years ago and is now Head of Managing Director all of our commercial operations in North America. Brian joined us after a 22-year career at NCR where he most recently was Head of their -- globally Head of all their FI Products and Solutions.</p><p>Also joining Brian is Brad Nolan. Brad heads up our Allpoint Solutions for the business. Brad also joined us about 2 years ago, and came from a 20-year career with JP Morgan Chase where he most recently headed up Branch Automation Technology and Strategy.</p><p>Following a quick break, Marc Terry, who is our Managing Director of International which are all of our markets outside of North America. He heads up the commercial activities in those various countries. He will hit on that, go into some detail about where we see the business going in each of these markets. Mark joined us from FIS where he was the Managing Director for at EMEA at FIS. Previously, he was the Managing Director of VocaLink in the United Kingdom after a carrier with ACI Worldwide.</p><p>Then I'm going to turn it over to Gary. Many of you all know Gary Ferrera, our CFO joined the company after I moved Nolan to CEO. Gary joined us from DigitalGlobe where he was CFO there up until the company sale and then prior to that he had been CFO of 3 other companies.</p><p>As I mentioned, the rest of the management team is here. I really encourage you to meet with the team during the intermission or afterwards. Also, pleased to announce one other member who is not here today, but will be joining the company in about a month will be our new Chief Marketing Officer. Paul Wilmore who is most recently CMO of Barclays in U.S.A. and Head of Barclays' Barclaycard and credit card businesses for the last -- has about a 25-year experience within the card business and brings a lot of great expertise for partnership in B2B2C businesses, which we'll be talking a little bit more why that's an important hire going forward.</p><p>So let's jump in. Basically, what we have here is a plan on the page. There's a lot that's been going on over the last 1.5 years. We've been very focused on driving durable organic growth in the business. We're evolving the company from a legacy ATM deployer to a self-reinforcing network-based business going forward. We've been investing heavily in new products, enhanced products in the business, all informed based on multiple conversations with financial institutions around the world. We believe that these new and enhanced products, combined with our end-to-end platform that we have today as some of the leading retailers scale and experience, will enable us to tap into an evolving secular trend in consumer financial services. We believe that trend and that market is roughly a $15 billion market that we will be able to tap into. These solutions that we've been working on make us very viable with financial institutions of all sizes, whether a community bank or the largest bank in the land, a FinTech or BigTech, all drive significant value and also very importantly, as do our core leading retailers around the world. So all parties participate and win with these solutions. Now the way we're going to approach this $15 billion market through a combination of that self-reinforcing network as well as enhanced managed services capabilities for financial institutions. That, combined with growth that we see in certain European markets, we believe will lead to long-term durable revenue and earnings growth for the company. Ultimately, what will evolve are is -- our locations will become physical-to-digital kiosk serving a broadening set of financial services transactions at a leading retailer near you. Now what we're going to do is get into how we're going to do all those different matters.</p><p>But for those of you who are new to the story, little bit of background. Cardtronicshas 25 years of experience, started up in Houston, Texas. Today, we operate in 10 countries around the world and each of the markets that we operate have a little bit difference in characteristics and market dynamics affecting each one of those. We believe our medium-term growth will largely come from North America, centered in the United States and also markets such as Spain, Germany and South Africa, we expect to see a significant amount of growth. Markets like United Kingdom and Australia have been going through a lot of change. Based on different variables in each country, specific amount of change leading to re-optimization of operations here but we're beginning to see the size of that stabilizing and believe that these markets too will return back to growth.</p><p>In all of these markets, we are either the #1 or #2 leading independent deployer of ATMs in each of those countries and that's an important fact. Some other factoids I think are very interesting, which we'll talk more about today, we're in 8 of the top 10 retailers in the United States. We are convenient, tens of thousands of locations, top convenience in the U.S. There are over 60 million card members who participate in Allpoint and frankly, most of them don't even know it. We see that as an opportunity.</p><p>Next, 2.5 billion transactions a year, we transact over our platforms on over 200,000 ATMs. We have scale and we have significant experience. And finally, we have relationships with over 2,000 financial institutions around the world. That is a significant opportunity with an installed set of customers. All in all, what does this mean? It means that we participate in a 2-sided network between financial institutions and retailers on either side with global scale and significant experience and convenience.</p><p>Now a year ago, I outlined a set of priorities for the company and what we're going to be focused on and what the new management team would be driving towards. First and foremost, drive durable organic revenue growth. The company has a long history of driving organic growth, but also a lot of M&amp;A. What we decided is we need to focus and execute on integrating our operations and upgrading our capabilities, developing new systems, products and enhancements to open ourselves up to a new market and needed to get focused. Second, operational excellence and portfolio optimization. How we're bringing these platforms together, integrating together so that we can drive scale and operating leverage in the business and also result in better customer experience who better controls, the mantra is scalable, repeatable, driving standardization across the business. Third, creating raving fans with our customers. I just talked about a phenomenal installed base. We -- there is a lot of opportunity, the more we can do in having those customers becoming bigger and bigger fans of our organization, the more we can expand just within that installed base, but also referrals to new customers. Fourth, generating employee pride. We have a purpose-driven mission and our employees know it. Working with communities around the world and supporting cash transactions. We want Cardtronicsto be a place where folks are proud of to move up into their careers at the company and finally, delivering on our financial commitments, delivering significant free cash flow.</p><p>So what was the report card. How did we do? First, this past year we turned the company North America back to organic growth. 2017, organic growth was a negative 2% and 2018, we moved that in North America to a positive 4%, really centered by the growth in the United States. Second, we had double-digit surcharge-free growth in our surcharge-free network in the U.S. this past year. And we had double-digit growth in our growth countries of Spain, Germany and South Africa.</p><p>Operationally, we returned back to ATM, our availability came up to record levels. We want to thank Stuart MacKinnon over here, who is our CIO and Chief Operations Officer. We integrated our technology and operations, new software, rolling out capabilities, enhancements, integrating the platforms for record availability. What did that result in? More ATMs up running, happier customers and better results to the bottom line. We optimized the fleet. We look at every ATM around the world in terms of its own profitability and contribution and we're putting it to the highest and best use that led to the pull out of Poland, redeploying those resources to Germany, to Spain where we get back into growth and making more money and cash flow in those markets. But that doesn't stop there. We are all over the world, whether it's been Australia, United Kingdom, the U.S., every market we go through to optimize our network and portfolio. We rolled out our ERP. And finally, it's something we're very proud of, our Allpoint solution based on independent survey from Walker rated Allpoint as Truly Loyal based on feedback from our customers with Allpoint.</p><p>And finally, financially, we exceeded the expectations that we outlined at the first of the year, throughout the year and how we ended up the year. We had significant free cash flow. Our free cash flow is up nearly 60% on a year and ended up over $100 million, all of which we used to pay down debt for the company and now on a glide path to getting back into our targeted leverage levels, which I'll talk about in a minute.</p><p>Now a lot of you all had questions over the time thinking about revenues and just having a better understanding, looking at our various revenue types. So what I thought would do is quickly walk through 3 different views within our revenue. First, you see on here is geographic. Over 60% of our revenue is centered in North America. Obviously, the lion share of that is in the United States. Next look is by our ATM type, around -- in terms of our ownership of the ATMs. So we have over 230,000 ATMs that we operate. Over 88% of the revenues that we generate come from those ATMs that we own. This shows the average number of ATMs, the 77,000. We ended the year with roughly about 75,000 being deployed. 88% of our revenues for the year came through those that we own. And the third area, a way of view of looking through the business comes into by the type of customer experience that's happening at the machine. So on the left-hand side, you will see about 41% of our revenues are generated by customers who are on a surcharge-free basis, meaning they're going to get their money and not being charged for that and it's free to the consumer. Secondly, 50% of our revenues come on a surcharge basis, meaning they go to the machine and they pay a convenience fee to access their money. And the third way, 9% of that is through managed services. Now what I'd like to do is drill into these 3 areas a little bit more and give you a little bit more visibility each into those 3 categories. So again, 41% surcharge-free and this is on a global basis, 41% surcharge-free we call that in the U.S. In the United Kingdom, we call that free use. And globally, we're about 50% on a surcharge and 9% managed services.</p><p>Now let's drill in. And probably, the best way to look at what are the different sources and types of revenues that are coming into, let's look at a particular ATM. Obviously, we're here in the U.S., so we're going to focus on the view from the U.S. business, which is our largest segment, country. And let's just take a look at the closest ATM nearby. So type in looking at the NASDAQ market, what is our closest ATM to where we're sitting here today through the eyes of Allpoint. So we want to find out what's the closest using our Allpoint locator, what are the closest ATMs and we see within a several block radius there are about 10 locations that are all within walking distance. We've got just surrounded and covered of a convenient ATM. In fact, we got all of America covered, 83% of the population is within 5 miles of one of our ATMs. If we look at right here, the closest one, which happens to be right across the street at the Walgreens, what do we find? What we find is this ATM. It's branded, it's branded with Citibank. If we go to that CVS, which was a block and a half away, we see a different branded ATM where we own the ATM and is branded with Santander on that. So let's say I am a Citibank customer coming in and want to access my cash through that branding relationship, I personally can go in access my cash for free and withdraw that. Our revenue stream on that through branding institutions is a fixed monthly payment based per ATM on a monthly basis to allow those customers to access the ATM at no charge. In addition to it, the financial institution also pays us a per transaction fee every time one of their customers. So it's a combination of both the fixed monthly payment per ATM plus a per transaction fee.</p><p>The person behind that at the Walgreens, maybe an Allpoint customer. That Allpoint customer, say perhaps, I bank with either Capital One or USAA, both Allpoint customers, that individual comes up is also able to probably use their locator app, which is embedded in the financial institution to access and find that machine, go in there, use that for free. Our revenue sources on that are multiple, different types. The financial institution can either pay us a fixed monthly rate based on having network access to our ATMs for all of their card members or they can pay us on a per transaction basis. So the FI can pay either a fixed basis based on having broad network access on their total number of cardholders or on a per transaction. In addition, we receive interchange on that. And so the interchange goes to the ATM owner or deployer and obviously we deploy the majority and significant preponderance of the network -- Allpoint network ATMs so the majority of that interchange comes to us.</p><p>Now behind that person could be a surcharge. So who is going to come in, wants to access, walk in here of the Times Square, wants to access cash at the ATM and he will pay a convenience fee for that. In addition to, in the United States, we would also receive interchange from their financial institution. Separately, perhaps there is an international customer behind that individual, who is coming in from another country, visiting, wants to get some U.S. dollars at the machine. They too pay that same convenience fee plus we would receive international surcharge. And in addition to we'd have the opportunity for a DCC transaction should they want the peace of mind in understanding what the amount being withdrawn is in local currency we could do have -- they could choose to have a DCC transaction.</p><p>So as you can see at that one ATM right across the street we have multiple different sources of revenue to come into that, whether it's on a surcharge-free basis, branding, Allpoint, surcharge basis, multiple different types coming at a single ATM. We would call that a network ATM. It is our goal to continue to try to drive working with financial institutions and FinTechs of the like to drive more and more traffic to this type of experience.</p><p>The third area, going back to that by pie, was in managed services. Over 130,000 ATMs that are under our managed services relationships. The vast preponderance of those, over 130 -- about 130,000 are retailer merchants who are ordering -- processing their transactions at their ATM and all our platforms are processing. We're the largest processor of ATM transactions in the free world, big benefit there in processing those transactions. Those are long-term arrangements and that they have variable per transaction type rate. What we see growing now is several thousand ATMs that are on full-managed services basis, basically outsourcing of an ATM fleet with a financial institution.</p><p>With those, and an example here was PenFed, where a PenFed, which is one of the nation's largest credit unions, we manage their estate of 135 ATMs around the world. We're held to SLAs, performance levels on that and we're honored to serve their customers. And under any of those types of relationships with typically a long-term arrangement, more of a fixed pricing nature with some variability. Again, what we see there in the managed services is a growing market, adding long-term more contractual revenue.</p><p>Now what's going on in the marketplace, what's new? Some of you may say, Ed, there's been changes going in banking and FI for a long time. There's nothing really new. We spent a lot of time, one of the favorite things I like to do is getting out with the sales team and meeting with customers and prospects and understanding what's working, what's not. There's a lot changing in the marketplace. What's changing is the big banks and the regional banks are on the move. They're moving into new markets, they're looking for more customer growth, they're looking for more deposits and they're going into new markets all over the country in the U.S.</p><p>Separately, what that means for the incumbents who have an installed base there. They are being threatened. They need to drive better efficiency ratio. They need to drive their cost down. They need to at presence. There is big larger banks coming in overnight, quick access to a large catchment area in a particular market. The incumbent institutions need to defend their area. In addition to that, you have FinTechs and BigTech who are coming into markets, but they're doing it in a nontraditional way. They're going direct to the consumer, bypassing the traditional rails into the market, and with the digital native, and mobile experience, and going directly to the customer, and they are doing that on a national way. So there's a lot happening and changing in the marketplace. What's the common element in all of those? Customer growth, customer engagement and a relentless focus on efficiency ratio. Everybody has to drive their cost down. And what does that force? It forces a mindset of how do I reprioritize my investments and my resources to the highest and best use in terms of what's core to me. This thesis holds true for every financial institution in the land. They have to reprioritize their resources to where the consumer is and what they're desiring is that mostly the digital and mobile experience. If you look at the most recent example with the announcement with SunTrust and BBT. One of the chief reasons they put out on that is to get to scale and get the technology, and be able to invest more resources in technology. And what they need to do is move out of what's not core. We would submit, and I think financial institutions are increasingly recognizing what's not core is managing an ATM estate and managing that cash infrastructure, one of the big services that financial institutions have provided at the branch for a long time has been that cash infrastructure. Now they're increasingly recognizing that, that's not core. But you know what? It is core to us and we do that in a larger, more scalable, in a lower cost than many institutions all over the world.</p><p>So how has this been coming together? How has this been looking and manifesting itself? If you look in the United States, in the last 10 years, branches have declined by about 10%. And frankly, over the last couple years, the pace of decline has accelerated at a record level. This same phenomena holds true in almost every country in which we operate. In the United Kingdom, over 800 branches closed the past year, a significant increase in the number of closures. In the United Kingdom, the number of ATMs are now below 70,000 ATMs. Same fact in Australia. Australia, they're closing branches every month, and now the number of ATMs -- the total number of ATMs in Australia is below 30,000. So this same phenomena is holding true throughout the business. And again, at these branches, which -- the branches will always be around, just not as many. These branches and the related ATMs provided a major source of the cash infrastructure for the country. And what we believe is we can support that.</p><p>Now why is that cash important? Because to their customers, it matters. Cash matters to the citizens in each one of the countries that we operate in. If you look at the -- on the top right of this slide about the global class usage, that's in the United States. Cash still today represents 30% of the point-of-sale payment. Obviously, debit and other forms have been growing. They're going to continue to grow. This mix is going to continue to change and evolve over time with different technologies and different capabilities, but the fact still remains cash will still be a significant source of payment. Separately, this same pie is very similar in every country in which we operate. It's still a major component and a significant component of all the forms of payment. And in fact, looking at cash, cash in United States actually if you look in the bottom of this chart, here for the last 7 years, it grows faster than GDP. This is the cash in circulation overall in the U.S. based on Federal Reserve and circulation is growing faster than GDP. By the way, that same curve in terms of cash growing faster than GDP is the case in every country in we operate around the world where it outpaces overall GDP. And why is all that? Why is this so important? Because cash is secure, it's private and it's reliable, it works. Citizens across the country, day in day out, the use and security around cash. However, what's also happening is consumer preferences are changing. It used to be that a consumer to handle that cash transaction would go to the branch closest to them. That's why they would open a bank account there what was the most convenient. That's now evolving to where the most important experience is the digital experience and the mobile experience to open up an account with the second most on that is connected to a broad convenient surcharge-free ATM network. That's now become one of the most deciding factors, the second most important factor when opening up a new account. Again, that's where we step in into this situation.</p><p>So what does that mean? It means a robust market opportunity, but you have to look at and start with our current presence in the marketplace. Today, in the United States, on the left-hand side of this chart, you can see we represent about 9% of the total ATMs in the country. We are convenient. Those 9% are at some of the leading retail locations around the United States. Obviously, tens of thousands of ATMs. We're nearly as large as the 3 largest banks in the country combined. And by the way, this phenomena is true in each of our major countries, where we're nearly as large as the 3 largest banks combined, same way in United Kingdom, same way in Australia. We have a significant market presence and at the most convenient locations.</p><p>But if you look on the right-hand side, the total number of transactions that occur in these markets, we're only 4% of the share of transactions. So we have an under representation in terms of the number of transactions versus our presence. And frankly, we're likely more convenient presence in the market. Over 86% of the transactions happen at a bank branch through a teller or through an ATM based on the way this historically been in the market, has been structured.</p><p>If we add in deposits, it amplifies it even more, where today obviously we still have the same ATM presence, and obviously not all -- don't have the functionality across the network for all the deposits. But now we're less than 2% of the transactions that are happening with over 90% of those happening at a bank branch or a bank ATM.</p><p>What this has defined, our focus over the last 1.5 years. So if we look at this pie, the total market of all these transactions, we believe that pie is a $15 billion market that's beginning to open up of serving and supporting the cash transactions in the U.S. This similar phenomenon is true in other countries which we operate. Obviously, our product solution and where the market is in the U.S., we feel it is more poised to capitalize on this. But the total pie on the right is roughly we estimate to be about $15 billion market that's beginning to open up. But to truly make inroads on this emerging secular trend, in this emerging opportunity, we need to invest and enhance our solutions, our products and how we go-to-market and we truly need to get into deposits and enabling both cash in and cash out, enabling checks in to the system, but also investing in product to allow FinTechs and BigTech to come into the market as well. Those enhancements would include an open API to allow FinTechs to tap in, which broadens us up, opens up the aperture to a whole new market of transaction types to come into our network to where now FinTechs and BigTech can come in, access our network, circumventing the traditional rails through that API. But also enabling cardless cash access and rolling that out across our portfolio. You're going to hear more about these product solutions from Brian and Brad in a little while focusing on North America.</p><p>Looking at this, you me say, okay, I can see that trend, that makes a lot of sense, but why Cardtronics, why you deserve to really make inroads in this? Great question, because no one has the end-to-end scale, capabilities, experience and end-to-end network like Cardtronics. This is a 3-point network. And to truly make inroads and on that opportunity and looking at that market of the $15 billion market, we feel like it's paramount to have all 3 elements of this network. Starting off with first on the bottom right, the -- having ownership of the physical ATM locations and the ATM at all those conveniently based retail locations where America goes to shop already. So having ownership and ownership of the experience on that ATM and the control of that experience on the ATM. Separate is having ownership of the processing platform, to be able to process those transactions and sending the messages to those in a proprietary way and having that connectivity between the ATM and the processing. And then you add that to the world's largest retail based surcharge-free network based on retailers. So when you combine those 3 elements of the ATM ownership, ownership of the network and the processing platform, that allows us to tailor the experience, control the experience, invest in upgrades, quickly deploy out new solutions, new capabilities onto this network. Over the past 1.5 years, one of the things that we did is hire Dan Antilley and his team for information security and making us bank-grade and working with the largest banks in the land from an information security. You have to have, if you really want to make inroads in that pie, is having the security capabilities and the expectations of that. We need to be able to tailor the experience at the ATM for those financial institutions where you as a customer understand the experience back to your financial institution. We want to be able to roll out different transaction types and broaden our types of transactions, you need to have ownership of all 3 of these elements to truly do that. And only Cardtronicshas this end-to-end platform and unique capability.</p><p>Now let's focus a minute on our network and our surcharge-free network. This is probably what has me the most enthusiastic as I think about the value creation of this company going forward and it's really centered into this surcharge-free network. What we have is a two-sided, two-party self-reinforcing network. On one side, you have financial institutions. Today, over 1,000 financial institutions participate in this surcharge-free network in the United States between Allpoint and also bank branding relationships. On the other side of the network, you have the retailers, 8 of the top 10 retailers in the United States, some of the most convenient locations, tens of thousands of locations across the land, so the two sides of this network is self-reinforcing. And how is this self-reinforcing as the financial institution? Since their customer, because of convenience of sending that to a retailer where the individual already knows, already knows where America is going to shop, go into that retailer, in there as a matter of convenience for that individual and the retailer benefits by having the store traffic come in and the consumer come into their store and transact a transaction with money in their hand. Obviously, the retailers get significant value from that. Then it comes back to be self-reinforcing back to the financial institution because it drives more value and more loyalty. All of this, the value from the loyalty, the convenience, the retailer benefit by the store traffic and the financial institution benefit from the loyalty and growth is very tangible and quantifiable. And you're going to hear more about that later from Brad about how we've worked with another party with Novantas to derive the value that's created into this. What's also interesting on this self-reinforcing network is it's self-reinforcing on both of the sides themselves. So it's self-reinforcing with the financial institutions where if you are a bank, say a community bank in a town, and you're offering -- you have access in Allpoint, you're offering your customers 40,000 ATMs around the country for surcharge-free, and your competitor around the corner doesn't, and they're saying wait a minute, I'd better keep up with these guys, and being that, it's self-reinforcing within the financial institutions, you want to be in, on that. Separately, on the retailers, when they're seeing millions -- tens of millions of transactions coming in to those retail locations based on this surcharge-free network, there's significant value. This past 18 months served as a great case study and an example about how all that happened and how real that is, where in the last year you saw double-digit surcharge-free growth in this network. And for the existing retailers who are in there saw a double-digit transaction growth in their locations. For those who left, didn't. So tens of millions of transactions changed for those who did not participate in this versus the ones who did. It was self-reinforcing and value-added for all parties involved. This is so important to us in North America, we've aligned our compensation to do this. The more we can work with the financial institutions and the retailers driving more and more transactions into this network, drives more operating leverage, more scale and more value added. So one of our key goals is driving more transactions into this network.</p><p>Now even drilling down further, which even brings us to another level on this. If we take that surcharge-free network and once you add it to the other products that we're now offering, this is another activity that we've been focused on over the last 1.5 years, is when we add in the managed services solution of a broadening product and capability and for the financial institutions, and we add in the surcharge capabilities, again going back to those 3 components in that first pie chart I showed, to managed services, the surcharge-free and the surcharge bases are now being operated and delivered on a common platform.</p><p>Over the last 1.5 years, we've undergone great strides to integrating our platforms, our capabilities, our scale, skill of delivering this on this integrated platform whether that's cash management, cash forecasting, customer care, our engineering, product development, processing and settlement, all being leveraged off of a common platform to deliver each of these solutions and pointing to that or tapping in here. What does that mean? That means scale and that means operating leverage, which we believe translates into margin expansion going forward.</p><p>So stepping back, what does all this mean? It means what we see and we believe is emerging is a significant opportunity based on a secular trend emerging with the financial and retail consumer services. That opportunity is a market that we believe will be opening up, represents about a $15 billion market. When you take the products that we have, the enhancements and the new ones that we've been rolling out in addition to our end-to-end scalable platform that's integrated, we believe we have a pathway to make significant inroads and lead to long-term growth for this company based on approaching that market that's opening up. And the good news is, little changes go a long way. 1% -- give you an example of that, 1% change in that share representation represents about a 20% same-store transaction growth. Let me say that again, increasing one share in that is equivalent to about 20% same-store sales growth -- or transaction growth. So as you can see, we're very focused on building out those relationships with the financial institutions with the value-add that they can derive from this, whether it's the biggest bank in the land to the smallest, all can benefit. FinTechs and BigTech all benefit by participating into this network and most importantly, so do our wonderful partnerships with the retailers that we have in each country in which we operate.</p><p>So what does all this mean to us as owners? It means what we like to outline with you is revenue growth that we expect over the medium-term, roughly 3% to 5% revenue growth over the medium term. We expect earnings and EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% over the next several years with margin expansion going back to that platform that we've been working so hard in integrating and developing, and that's the growth that we are outlining and expect. All of that on top of a very disciplined focus on capital allocation. Something that Gary and I take in our roles very importantly is being disciplined on the capital allocation decisions. First and foremost, capital be deployed into areas where we see quantifiable and tangible growth, back into the business and product enhancements and capabilities in that network, all with a sharp eye towards returns. And if there are any other investment opportunities that could also lead to solid growth with clear returns, meeting our hurdles. Beyond that, investments what we expect to we're going to continue to drive towards our targeted leverage level of getting to 2x to 2.5x overall leverage. And as we achieve that, entering that level, we expect to come back to you to announce either stock repurchase and/or dividend when the time is appropriate. We believe we will reach these targeted levels within the next 12 months, either by the end of this year or early part into next year.</p><p>In the interim, as we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors has approved an opportunistic share repurchase program where the company can opportunistically step into the market. To the extent we see dislocations in the stock price, feel like it's only prudent to be able to have the company and be able to go buy -- purchase its own shares based on the confidence of where we are as a company and what we have ahead of us in achieving our overall leverage and growth levels. So we announced that yesterday and now have that in place.</p><p>So with that, that is my overview of where we are, what we've been focused on as an organization and team and company. We're very enthusiastic about it, and I'm also honored to be able to introduce Brian Bailey, who is our Managing Director and Head of all our commercial activities in North America.</p><p>BRIAN JOSEPH BAILEY, EVP &amp; MD OF NORTH AMERICA, CARDTRONICS PLC: Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure on behalf of our North America team to share a few thoughts with you today about our wonderful North America business. What I'd like to do is start today is to share a few key takeaways that we're going to talk through over the next 25 minutes. Brad Nolan will join me on stage in a few minutes to share our solution profile and how we're going to develop growth around products. But to begin, our business in North America begins and ends with our retailer relationships and our retail-based ATM network. We believe this is a competitive advantage in the market for us and will become increasingly a scale advantage for us over time. Secondly, we believe financial institutions represent a significant opportunity for us in the marketplace over the near-term horizon. Consolidation of bank-based ATM transactions to our retailer-based network as well as helping them with their physical distribution challenges going forward, we think is a huge opportunity for us. Thirdly, our end-to-end platform of retail-based ATMs creates significant value proposition for FIs, retailers and consumer alike. And we believe this unique value proposition is poised to allow us to capitalize on the secular trends in the marketplace impacting financial institutions, and we think that can lead to durable organic growth across our region.</p><p>So I'll talk a little bit about our North America region going forward. Our North America team is growing increasingly confident that we can create and be a growth engine for our company. And it really begins with, as Ed mentioned earlier, our significant market scale across the marketplace. Over 9% of the ATMs across North America are CardtronicsATMs. And with that scale and share brings significant competitive advantage in a few key areas. Number one, we have significant share of retailer and FI relationships. These are long-standing durable relationship that we believe are important to our future success. Number two, we also believe we have scale of transactions on top of that ATM network. And scale of transactions matters in the payments business when it comes to cost and efficiencies. This is and will become an increasing competitive advantage for us in the market. And thirdly, we have scale of products that are here and embedded in the marketplace today. Look no further than our Allpoint product. This is a product that is adopted by over 1,200 financial institutions in the market today, creating scale for us across the market. Not only we have scale, we also have diversity of geographies across our market. While I won't talk specifically about the Mexico market today and focus my remarks primarily on the U.S. market, many of the themes that I will talk about strategically do apply to our Canadian market as well which we're very excited about.</p><p>So let's talk about our strong foundation of retailer relationships. Not only are these relationships durable, but they are also very long-lasting. 8 of the top 10 retailers in the marketplace today creating locational convenience which matters to consumers. In addition to that, these relationships are long-lasting. Our average relationship age of our top 10 retail clients is nearly 10 years, which is a significant advantage for us. We'll also use attributes, words like access and convenience throughout the day today. It means 2 words are very important for our network. Firstly, 83% of the population of the U.S. lives within 5 miles of a Cardtronics ATM, creating that locational convenience that consumers will increasingly demand going forward. And across the North American network, we process over 264 million transactions on an annual basis. Within the U.S. portion of that network, we see 75 million unique cards transacting on our Cardtronicsnetwork on an annual basis. Think about that number, 75 million, near 1/4 of the population of the U.S. market that are actually transacting and visiting a Cardtronics ATM on an annual basis.</p><p>So in summary, durable relationships, convenient locations and an increasingly strategic approach, which gives us a strategic advantage in the marketplace versus our competitors. But as we meet with retailers across the marketplace today, there are significant headwinds and disruptions that are facing their business. As we meet with C-Suite executives and category managers across the leading retailers in this country, there is significant pressure coming from e-commerce in terms of 2 main factors. How do I increase customer trips into my store? And how do I increase basket size and margins of goods and purchases in my store? These are significant headwinds that every retail executive is facing. How do I also diversify my business quickly enough to create scale and competitive advantage versus the cost efficiencies of e-commerce providers? This is significant headwinds and disruption that's happening to our retailers across the market.</p><p>Retail financial institutions are facing similar challenges today. How do I invest in physical infrastructure, branches and ATMs to allow the sort of deposit share growth I need into new markets while dealing with the efficiency ratio challenges that Ed talked about earlier. How do I keep pace with mobile innovation and digital platform investments, while still dealing with the sort of speed and acceleration that FinTechs are presenting in terms of competitiveness to financial institutions. These are the sort of market factors that we believe are coming together to create value for our shared network. As Ed mentioned earlier, we have a shared network, which creates interdependency and when our retailers and financial institutions can come together to solve their problems, we think there's an increasing synergy and value for both. Retailers with the need to welcome customers into their store, trips, basket size on an increasing basis and financial institutions who are looking to consolidate transactions at a lower cost per transaction, we think this fits perfectly into our model. But at the core of this model is the consumer. And as we talked about earlier, we have this wonderful luxury with our surcharge-free propositions to welcome nearly 60 million Allpoint customers into this ecosystem to drive that traffic to retailers. We have over 14,000 branded ATMs in the marketplace with the leading FIs with our surcharge-free branding proposition, again to drive that awareness and engagement into our retailer stores. But that doesn't happen by accident. We have a specific strategy where we engage with retailers and FIs to create awareness and consumer interaction and education to make them aware of that surcharge-free proposition in our stores. We have a playbook that we run across all of our customer-facing team members to drive those transactions and to engage with customers in a way that we believe is significantly unique in the marketplace and that has driven double-digit surcharge-free growth to our retailers today.</p><p>So in summary, retailers who are welcoming customers into their store at an increasing basis, a consumer profile who are looking for locational convenience to transact on a regular basis and finally, financial institutions who are looking to optimize their physical network, we think this is a perfect summary for opportunity.</p><p>So why are ATMs still relevant for financial institutions? Well, the reality is a leading digital platform is not alone enough to welcome and grow primary deposit relationships for retail banks. To the 2018 Novantas shopper survey, we have learned and recognized a couple things. Number one, a digital platform is important that has arisen in terms of importance, but the other channel that's important for consumers when selecting a primary financial institutions is fee-free access to cash. And over the last 4 years, that relevance of perceived convenience has taken over from branch market share which has declined. Consumers are demanding on an increasing basis a leading digital platform, fee-free access to cash and this will fuel and grow financial institution deposit growth as we move forward, and we think that fits perfectly into our strategy moving forward.</p><p>We also see, in our marketplace and interaction with customers every day, that there are common challenges facing FIs of all sizes. This is not about the national banks, this is about banks from mid-market to community banks to the leading national banks and there's several key things we hear through our visits with customers. Number one, how do I optimize my network, reduce my operating costs and creating efficiencies in core markets where market share growth will become difficult. We see this happening across the marketplace through branch transformation and reduction initiatives and overall consolidation. We also see growth and growth is alive and well in our market. As Ed mentioned, banks are on the move. They're looking for new geographies, they're looking for new market demographic and segments to grow their deposit base. And we think this affects banks of all size as they're looking to optimize to grow deposit at the fraction of the cost without putting up the traditional physical infrastructure.</p><p>But also there's this new opportunity of digital banks that have arrived on the scene. Banks without the physical ATM or branch network yet with the need to welcome cash into their ecosystem. We see that's from both the digital banks where they've launched over the last 5 years, many of whom we're working with as well as the digital wallet providers. How do we welcome cash into the digital ecosystem and allow a light physical touch within their digital footprint? Cardtronicshas solutions to solve all of these problems, whether it's reducing cost in key markets by creating branded or physical distribution to replace physical branches that are reduced, whether it's helping banks move more quickly into new markets at a fraction of the physical distribution cost or whether it's helping digital banks and financial technology companies to move quicker into the digital ecosystem complemented by cash, Cardtronicshas a solution for each of those.</p><p>And here's the new news in terms of available market, which we're very excited about. Cardtronics' historical available market has been primarily limited to the independent ATM deployment market. Cash withdrawals through our Cardtronicsnetwork. We also participate in a fraction of the FI transaction market as well through our surcharge-free Allpoint and bank branding proposition. That totals nearly 2 billion transactions a year. Within that 2 billion, our transactions annually in the U.S. is roughly 200 million. So think of us as a 10% share player in our historical or existing share market. However, there's a much larger opportunity out there for us. We believe the cash withdrawals will be flat to down over the next 4 to 5 years. However, the significant opportunity for us is to take advantage of the branch transformation opportunity that's happening and with those branch transformations, we believe deposit transactions over time will move from teller lines inside branches to ATM machines, which consumers will increasingly use for basic transaction. That's what's going to grow the available market of deposit transactions from 2 billion a year to nearly 4 billion a year, and we believe that is our opportunity as we go forward. The increase of our available market by nearly 4.5 times.</p><p>So how do we get there? This is not about overnight waking up and addressing a new available market. We have 3 specific initiatives underway, which you will hear about throughout the day that are underway and taking hold in the marketplace to allow us to serve that full $9 billion -- 9 billion transaction opportunity. Firstly, we're enhancing our surcharge-free products Allpoint and bank branding to address a much larger part of the market. We're going to go up markets to the major banks in the marketplace as well as downmarket to small banks, enhancing, configuring our surcharge-free products to be more consumable by all FIs. Number two, we're enhancing our managed services offer, which has historically been focused primarily on the mid-tier segment of the U.S. market. Banks between 50 and 500 ATMs. We're configuring that offer now to go downmarket to welcome 1,000 -- thousands of banks into that ecosystem as well as moving upmarket into the off-premise fleet of major financial institutions. And thirdly, and most excitingly as Brad Nolan will talk about in a few minutes, our Allpoint+ deposit network. That's what's going to unlock that 4 billion transaction market opportunity and we're very excited about that. So how does this all come together in terms of our platform? Well, the great news is we're not starting from scratch. As I mentioned throughout the presentation, the foundation of our North America business starts and ends with our retail relationship and we've been busy over the last 3 years with our operations and technology team to create incredible scale as well as resiliency within this network. We've been improving our security and compliance initiatives. We've been improving our user experience at the ATM itself to a brand-new software platform. These are sort of things that matter to the availability of our network in the usability to consumers, but they also matter significantly to financial institutions who value security, value compliance increasingly. We layer our financial relationships on top of this network and we believe, as Ed mentioned earlier, 1% share growth can be a 20% increase in same-store transactions and we can do that with our existing 1,200 bank partners today, driving more and consolidating more of their transaction onto our retailer network. And again, this isn't by accident that this happens. We have a disciplined process for transaction driving where we work with financial institutions and retailers to drive consumer awareness and transactions to our network. And that playbook had resulted in significant results in 2018, double-digit surcharge-free growth across that retail base. That doesn't happen by accident and that's a ground game we're very excited about. But what's ahead is equally exciting. We have enhanced products of our existing embedded products in the market as well as new product development efforts, which we're very excited about and Brad Nolan will share with you in a minute. So if I refer to a little bit to execution, right. Execution is key to us. A great strategy is meaningless without execution. And we've been busy at blocking and tackling in the marketplace today in 3 key areas. From a sales force perspective, we've been busy hiring and recruiting and building industry-specific teams who are capable of articulating our value proposition to financial institutions and retailers. We have embedded enterprise-wide sales management processes as well as a new customer listening tool with our Walker Customer success survey. We have had record uptime from an availability perspective, which matters not only to our consumers but to our customers as well driven by Stuart and our operations team and we've launched a world-class call center and operations center in Frisco, Texas to take care of issues when they happen. And finally, critical to our long-term growth is becoming a world-class product development and management organization. It doesn't happen by accident. Designing, building and managing the lifecycle of new solutions for growth becomes important, and we've been very fortunate to get off to a great start with that this year. Underpinning all of these execution items, as Ed mentioned earlier, is creating financial incentives and targets that all of our front-line associates are rewarded for in terms of transaction driving. That happens across everybody on this page from product to operations to sales. Everybody is a incented up to 20% of their discretionary compensation to driving more transactions to our network.</p><p>So in summary, I'd like to share with you in -- a final page of my presentation, a wonderful case study that brings this strategy to life. Outside you all have seen a Allpoint+ deposit ATM. TDECU is a local Houston area credit union, a $3 billion institution who we've been partnering with over the last decade to bring our strategy to life. We became a partner with TDECU like many of our relationships through our Allpoint Network, creating surcharge-free access back in 2007. We quickly expanded that relationship as TDECU wanted to grow within that state of Texas to the Houston and Dallas market. And we did that through a branding relationship, branding some of our key retailer sites with the TDECU brand growing with the credit union as that expended their customer base. Culminating with the managed services relationship first off-premise and then on-premise where we now manage TDECU's entire ATM operation as a partner with them. Finally, TDECU has just joined our Allpoint+ network, opting into deposit-taking capability within our Houston market which is one of our first Allpoint+ markets to launch. This a significant example of how an existing relationship can expand with layered products, creating more value not just for TDECU, but the retailers across the marketplace.</p><p>What I like to do now is welcome Brad Nolan on to the stage. Brad is a wonderful partner of mine who has helped our team to build out great products. He is going to give you an exciting view of our product and solution platform.</p><p>JOSEPH BRADLEY NOLAN, EVP OF ALLPOINT SOLUTIONS, CARDTRONICS PLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Exciting times, banks are on the move. It's an exciting to be part of financial services and it's exciting to be covering financial services. Frankly, it's an exciting time to be part of the FinTech, creative things going on in the industry. Our comprehensive solutions platform enables financial institutions to solve for their key objective and Cardtronicshas an unparalleled advantage in enabling FI to achieve these key growth, customer experience and efficiency imperatives. We spent the past 24 months investing in our core Allpoint, ATM branding and managed services platforms. We're also, at the same time, introducing new capabilities to meet the evolving needs of this marketplace. So let's break this down. First, growth. Our products enable FI to grow their deposit share in home markets as well as provide a launch pad for growth into net new markets. Secondly, our products drive an overall better customer experience, enabling product appeal and stickier relationships. We know that the more customers leverage in individual channel as well as cross channels, the more likely they are to stay with their banking partner.</p><p>And finally, it's about efficiency. We can enable FIs to become more efficient in their branches as they pull transactions off their teller lines into our shared infrastructure, all through convenience and a simplified management model. I'll be stepping through our solutions here in a bit more detail over the coming minutes. But before I go there, it is important to point out, it's not just about having the right product. It has to be easy to implement, it has to be on-demand. If I remember my days in banking where sometimes it would take an eternity to get the simplest of technology changes across the line. Between competing resources, constrained tech budgets and regulatory agendas, it was tough. As we sought out to design our solutions platform, it had to be easy to implement, requiring little to no tech investment on behalf of the partnering FI. Each of our solutions is on-demand, enabling our partners to implement without technology or significant CapEx required on their side.</p><p>In fact, with each of our solutions, we can bring our FI partners live in under 60 days. Think of it as a switchboard, if you will, lighting up new markets and creating density and distribution in home markets virtually overnight. So what does this all mean? Banks are on the move. I think Brian put it best when he said they're expanding while optimizing. Our solutions platform is aligned to the key growth experience and efficiency objectives of these banks, enabling them to move faster without the need for significant technology investment or capital, all because of our network infrastructure. It's the latest technology brought to the market by the world's largest and most experienced ATM operator.</p><p>All right, so let's double click on Allpoint. With 40,000 ATMs here in the U.S. and 55,000 globally, Allpoint is the largest, most convenient 100% retail surcharge-free network. We've got placements in 7 of the top 10 retailers with ATM programs, over 1/2 of U.S. adults walk by one of our ATMs each month and 1/4 of U.S. adults use our ATMs annually. If you isolate just 4 of our top retail programs, it represents 17 million store visits per day, that is convenience defined. All on behalf of our 1,200 FI partners and their 60 million and growing debit active cardholders. This morning, I'd like to highlight 2 key initiatives heading into 2019 that we think are going to help drive the flywheel for Allpoint. First, brand. Allpoint has largely been a B2B brand represented by network bug on the back of a debit card and a small decal on the belly of the ATM. Consumer awareness is generally lacking. As a result, some of our FI partners commonly refer their customers to Allpoint's retailers without actually mentioning Allpoint by name. In 2019, we're stepping up our efforts to create a ubiquitous Allpoint experience. Everywhere I go I see an Allpoint ATM. The fact is everywhere you go, you already see an Allpoint ATM, you just don't know it yet. Allpoint will become much more prominent as we re-brand thousands of our own ATMs throughout the course of this year. Second, we now have the ability to customize our Allpoint Network. Look, our legacy network was largely built around the specific needs of the mid-market, the community banks, the credit unions, the direct banks and the prepaid programs, enabling them to achieve size and ATM scale of the much larger banks. As we look into this year, we can now customize the network to create tailored solutions around the unique market base needs, both growth and consolidation of this country's largest financial institutions. The feeling is now gone to sky is the limit. We can partner with the largest issuers out there and work with them moving market by market by market. I'd also like to point out that there's another way to surcharge-free access and that's through our ATM branding product. We all know that off-premise or remote non-branch branded ATMs drive a higher purchase rate for new checking acquisitions. It also drives higher retention rates for the FIs. And again, it creates efficiencies pulling transactions off the more expensive teller lines into the ATMs. It only makes sense, with that many more points to transact at, customers are going to go where it's convenient for them.</p><p>At the end of the day, some of our FI customers prefer the size, scale, convenience and ubiquity of Allpoint. Others prefer the brand presence created by our ATM branding product. More and more our top FIs are choosing both, joining Allpoint and selectively branding ATM portfolios, retail portfolios on top of that. Now the big news. So Allpoint is the baseline for growth, customer experience and efficiency. Brian just covered the fact that free and convenient access to cash at ATMs is a key driver when consumers are choosing who they bank with. Ed touched earlier on the secular changes underway in the industry that's impacting how consumers bank day in and day out. And with that, it's creating a massive opportunity for Cardtronicsas literally billions of transactions pour off the teller lines into ATMs. Let me say that again, literally as billions of deposits pour off the teller lines into ATMs. So with that, we're excited to introduce Allpoint+, the 100% retail, surcharge-free deposit ATM network, deposit ATMs are coming to a retailer near you. In fact, we began rolling these out into our Allpoint sites on the way to building a 100% surcharge-free retail deposit network.</p><p>Look, it's not just about getting cash out, it's about getting cash in and supporting the growth, customer experience and efficiency objective of banks, big and small. Many times these banks look to consolidate branches in home markets, they leave behind ATMs. Full function ATMs as a point of convenience for their consumers who now must drive even further to get to the next branch. As you think about new market launch, a deposit network can jump start and FI's effort in a market as they look to build out their new next-gen lighter weight branch infrastructures. And then of course, is the digital players that have already realized that cash access, both in and out, is required to compete with the traditional FIs.</p><p>To get this started, we actually partnered with the ATM manufacturers to custom design a our cash out, cash in, check in, full function recycling ATM all in the same form factor as a traditional cash dispenser. Then you say well, why is that important? Have you ever seen a traditional lobby full function device? It's about the size of a Mini Cooper. Good luck getting that through the doors at Duane Reade. Beyond that, we've partnered with the manufacturers to have engineered the box and make it economical tip to tail. Again, it had to be affordable for us to deploy at the scale we're looking to. Deployment entails going into our top retailers and our most highly foot traffic sites, taking out the basic cash dispenser that exists there and replacing it with this new full function, dispense and deposit ATM.</p><p>In fact, in Q4 of last year, we deployed just over 100 of them, predominantly in Chicago, with a handful in Houston and Dallas. In February of this year, we kicked off our 2019 deployment program. We've already wrapped up Houston, we've completed Miami, we've kicked off New York and we'll be launching Phoenix here in the coming weeks. We'll continue on a market-by-market basis at the end of this year deploying approximately 1,000 of these devices and deployments will then continue into next year. Think of it as a market-by-market march.</p><p>At the end of the day, this is something brand new. It's a 100% retail and in the most convenient locations. There's nothing out there like this. I want to stop here and just once again emphasize, we are putting a new lever in the hands of our financial services, our partners that has never existed before. And as a result, it's changing the tone of the conversations. Look, we talk to banks big and small, day in and day out, but this is new, this is different, these are C-suite conversations that are being had.</p><p>To further emphasize, I guess, the importance of deposits, take a look at the infographic here in the middle of the page, I'll get out of your way. But Ed, based on our own experience, right, and in device measurements, at the most highly traffic deposit ATMs, deposits actually outnumber withdrawals by a measure of 3:2. That's right. Deposit transactions outnumber withdrawals on a month-by-month basis. And when you peel it back and when you look at deposits, it's all about cash. In fact, cash deposits outnumbered check deposits by a measure of 5:1. It only makes sense, you can take a picture of a check with your phone and deposit it into your bank account. You can't yet do that with a $100 bill.</p><p>All right. Now the other new news this time involving digital. So digital is disrupting major segments of the market, financial services included, with innovative and accessible products value is beginning to shift towards these new FinTech competitors. That said, many FinTechs lack traditional carded portfolios which creates a friction point when it comes to cash access. We know through our own experience and data that digital balances rise and transactions increase, the easier it is to get cash in and out of those digital products.</p><p>I'm going to say it one more time. Digital balances rise and transactions increase the easier it is to get cash in and out of those digital products. The other thing is that FinTech needs often beyond basic withdrawals, deposits, transfers and so forth. So with that, we're excited to introduce ATM Mobile Cash, our proprietary API-based ATM network. We've begun rolling software out to our ATMs that enables consumers to use their phones to transact with the ATM, no debit card required. Traditional ATM networks have limited issuers and consumers to 4 basic transaction types: withdrawals, deposits, balance increase and balance transfers. That's how the rails were built. Our API is not burdened by these legacy rules.</p><p>And as a result, we can open this up to virtually any type of transaction from P2P funding to P2P pickup, cross-border money transfers. Again, the sky is the limit here, your online purchases, phone -- mobile phone account pop-ups, you name it. While we think this is a great experience, mobile that is, it's a great experience for traditional banking customers who choose not to carry their debit cards or maybe suddenly find themselves in emergency situation due to a lost or stolen debit card. The real benefit here is tapping into the exploding FinTech's segment, where those financial solutions provide -- already realized that there's real benefit through enabling their customers to take funds held in digital accounts and converting it to cash in hand. And now with Allpoint+ taking that cash in hand and converting it back into digital funds.</p><p>So we've talked a lot about retail and our network infrastructure, but what about the ATMs inside the branches? Ed covered it earlier. Branches have declined and will continue to do so. That being said, branches are not going away. They remain the hub for complex account openings, for advice and for problem resolution. And as long as there's branches, consumers will still go to branches to transact, albeit at branch ATMs, not the teller lines. CardtronicsU.S. has been in the Managed Services business for years, providing turnkey services to cash dispensers owned by financial institutions in retail and Bank-at-Work locations. We've recently taken a page from our Canadian operations as well as Australia and enhanced our product to also include managed services for image-deposit ATMs. And in doing so, we've opened up the 4 walls of the branch. Now we can provide true end-to-end managed services for our FI partners in branch and remote. Initially, we're targeting FIs with up to 500 ATMs. In this segment, there's roughly 7,000 financial institutions and 70,000 ATMs. When you layer on top of it, the nonbranch ATMs from this country's largest banks, this takes our strike zone up to roughly up to 90,000 ATMs. This, again, being part of that $15 billion market opportunity that both Brian and Ed addressed earlier. Again, it's kind of the third leg of the stool. You've got surcharge, you've got surcharge-free and now we've managed services.</p><p>With our product, we take control of the FIs ATMs. Many times taking ownership of them and/or replacing them with our own gear and putting on our own refresh and upgrade cycles. In addition, we deploy our highly customized proprietary software stack and in doing so bring best-in-class innovation, marketing, engagement, operational management and security to the platform, benefiting these FIs both in their branches and remote.</p><p>And our product is unique. What we don't manufacture the ATMs, we do just about everything else, from deployment management to software, to transaction switching, to operations monitoring and service deployment, balancing, reconciliation, you name it. We basically do what the banks do just on a much broader scale. It is the comprehensive ATM services platform from the world's largest vertically integrated ATM operator. So we've talked a lot about the whats so far. What's going on in the financial services industry, what's coming off the teller line, that's deposits if weren't paying attention and what is Cardtronicsdoing about it. Let's talk about the why. We recently partnered with Novantas to better understand the real impact to our FI partners a free and convenient access to cash via ATMs. In the study, we took a look at Allpoint banks, pre and post joining Allpoint.</p><p>We took a look at our branding partner banks, pre and post branding our portfolios and compared it all back to a control group. The data was eye-opening, showing strong measurable impact in both cost to serve as well as growing the FIs' deposit basis. In fact, the Allpoint customers increased their deposit share in market by 1.6% over the non-Allpoint customers. And again, it's not just about new checking account acquisition, it's about retaining the customers you already have, that customer experience piece we've been touching on. On the efficiency side, Allpoint banks were able to reduce their teller line transactions by 7.3% over the non-Allpoint banks, thereby enabling an 11.5% teller FTE savings. From there we took this and we built our models and we predict on a bank-by-bank basis the impact of taking an advantage of our product set. To put it in perspective, if you take a medium-sized regional player, run them through the model, our estimates say they would benefit to the tunes of tens of millions of dollars annually, all tied to teller line efficiency and deposit growth.</p><p>These benefits were attained without heavy lifting from the FIs. In essence, adding on Allpoint or adding on bank branding was additive to the physical infrastructures these banks already have. That said, benefits will intensify when a network, first Allpoint now Allpoint+ begins to replace, underscore that would replace the FI-owned infrastructure. Look convenience comes at a significant cost when you're only serving your customers. Banks spend between $200,000 and $350,000 per year per branch just to manage teller line transactions and another $10,000 to $20,000 to $45,000 in OpEx per year per ATM. Allpoint and Allpoint+ enable exponentially more points to transact at a fraction of the cost. This can dramatically improve a bank's operating efficiency ratio and it requires, again, 0 CapEx on behalf of the issuers.</p><p>I'd like to wrap with a brief case study, talking about how our product set benefits not only FIs and retailers, but consumers alike. We recently partnered with one of our top retailers to integrate them into the Allpoint network. And only months later, we partnered with one of our top Allpoint partners to bring them on as a branding partner in that same retailer. The result, nearly a 40% increase in withdrawals year-over-year. Look, this was a win for consumers who suddenly had thousands of more surcharge-free ATMs to transact at. This was a win for the ATM branding FI who saw their deposit share increase over the course of 3 years while still closing more than 10% of their branches. This was a win for the retailer who saw point-of-sale transactions increase to the tunes of millions year-over-year driven by net new Allpoint for traffic as well as [the branding] bank's own customers. And finally, this was a win for Cardtronicsshowing significant improvement to both our top and bottom lines.</p><p>So to recap. Our retail-based ATM network is our competitive and scalable advantage over our all other ATM operators. Changes in financial services are representing a huge opportunity for us. But again, it's all about deposits. Our end-to-end platform creates unique value for not only retailers and FIs but consumers alike. Allpoint and our growing solution portfolio solves for those growth, customer experience and efficiency challenges impacting financial institutions today. And as a result, we believe we're poised to capitalize on these secular changes underway, driving strong organic, durable growth for the years to come.</p><p>Thank you very much. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break right now, after which, Mark's going to join us on stage and update us on our international business. Thanks.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: All right. Time to get going again. If you recall back from the agenda, I'm going to turn it over and open it up to Marc Terry. Marc is our managing director of all our commercial activities on an international basis and joined us 1.5 years ago. So I'm going to turn it over to Marc and wrap up here.</p><p>MARC TERRY, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; MD OF INTERNATIONAL, CARDTRONICS PLC: Well, good morning, everyone. Thanks, Ed, thanks Brad and Brian for the earlier session.</p><p>My name is Marc Terry, and I'm the managing director responsible for the international business channel of Cardtronics. In essence, this comprises everything outside of the Americas, representing approximately 40% of the global Cardtronicsrevenue.</p><p>Let me remind you where we are located. The U.K. and Australia, headquartered in North London and Melbourne respectively. And then Germany, in Trier, which has been in Luxembourg of all places. Spain, in Barcelona, and South Africa, in Cape Town. You can see the relative sizes of each of these locations on the side of this chart. But by far and away, Australia and the U.K. are our largest markets within the international channel.</p><p>We consider the international channel from 2 perspectives: the U.K. and Australia are referred to as mature based on their tenure, infrastructure and the market presence that we have there; whilst Germany, Spain and South Africa are considered high-growth. During the next 20 minutes or so, I would like to present the international channel from both of these perspectives, growth and mature, concentrating on the growth potential contained within both.</p><p>There are 4 key takeaways for you today. Number one, our mature markets continue to generate very high cash flow, and they are on a growth trajectory based on additional transaction volumes through the current infrastructure that we have. Number two, our plan is continued double-digit expansion in our growth markets through more traditional ATM placements and transaction expansion again, which should outpace our mature sector. Thirdly, we continue to penetrate the cash value chain across all markets with new products and services, not dissimilar to some of the comments you've heard in the earlier presentations today. And finally number four, we expect EBITDA growth through 2020 and beyond for the international segment as a whole.</p><p>Each market segment has certain key characteristics worthy of note and highlights why we believe our approach in each is appropriate. In both the mature markets, we have a greater presence than the top 3 banks combined, as Ed mentioned earlier. Cash continues to rise in circulation, even though alternative instruments have existed for a number of years. And I refer to things like tap and go, contactless debit, real-time payments, et cetera, the new payments platform, for example, in Australia.</p><p>Both markets also have very loud government rhetoric regarding financial inclusion, especially in rural communities, where cash and the dependence on cash is much higher. In both the U.K. and Australia, we have the scale to drive adjacent business opportunity through that infrastructure.</p><p>Our opportunity in the mature markets is not dissimilar to the United States, in that our extensive ATM coverage positions us well to capture more transactions as banks withdraw from the provision of cash and withdrawals are consolidated onto fewer and fewer machines. Our mature markets are positioned for return to growth and extension into adjacent product categories.</p><p>In contrast, our opportunity in Spain, Germany and South Africa is created by a push into growing our ATM accounts in high footfall locations. And this is helped by a relatively low machine penetration and demand for cash that characterizes these markets. Consistent characteristics are as follows: strong demand from consumers for cash and a relatively slower adoption of new payment types.</p><p>Banks are retreating via branch closures and therefore, correspondingly, ATM disposals. Popular tourist destinations, with many profitable locations, are still widely available. And South Africa, in particular, is an underserved and growing market for us. Continued double-digit growth in these markets is expected through 2020 and beyond.</p><p>So what is our strategy in each of these markets? First, the U.K. and Australia, we're focused on driving more transactions through our ATM network, as I said earlier. We operate the largest network in both markets, and we will use this scale and differentiated service capability to drive new business in both our traditional and adjacent sectors.</p><p>The strategic changes being implemented by financial institutions in the reduction of ATM numbers and bank branches provide similar opportunities to those in North America. We're targeting financial institutions with co-branding services, ancillary services, managed services and enhancements to our base product offering that help them to maintain market presence as they execute their branch closure and ATM removal strategies. We're also very focused on cost optimization and the proactive management of our estate to ensure that each and every ATM is earning a solid return.</p><p>Looking at our growth markets of Germany, Spain and South Africa, by definition, we have a lower footprint in these markets, but we are taking advantage of the under-penetration, strong economic tailwinds and significant tourist traffic to deliver rapid growth of our machine count. The growth markets are experiencing similar shifts in strategy by the financial institutions as they cut branches and withdraw from the provision of cash to consumers. This is presenting us with additional growth opportunity, and we have already won some significant new business which I will talk of later. Our growth markets are retaining the reliance on cash, and this gives us a much longer runway to optimize the potential of our growing network.</p><p>Our goal is to drive bottom line growth across our international segment as a whole in 2020, and we believe we are very well-positioned to do so. I now want to give you a more in-depth view of each of the individual markets, starting with Australia. As I mentioned earlier, we have a large presence in Australia, which was impacted, as I'm sure you are aware, in 2017, when Commonwealth Bank, the largest Australian retail bank, announced it was to remove surcharge for every cardholder using their machines. This was then quickly followed by all the other financial institutions. This has created a major cost problem for the Australian banks, who have a large cost of running their ATM infrastructure, but with now no revenue correspondingly to offset.</p><p>We have successfully repositioned the business to take advantage of the prevailing market conditions. And throughout '18, we acted to optimize our operational capability, renegotiate contracts with our corporate clients and merchant clients, review locations and ancillary services, essentially restructuring all our cost lines to reflect the new market conditions.</p><p>As the volume declined, what was originally predicted did not materialize in '18. We believe that these restructuring activities have prepared us in Australia to be competitive in this new cash market. At the same time, the banks continue to reduce their machine count, as you can see from the chart on the right-hand side, to mitigate the cost challenge that they have created for themselves. We expect this to have a material positive impact on our network as consumers are persuaded by the reduction in bank ATMs onto our machines. We believe that this could increase the market share for independent operators to as high as 50% from the current 35% level.</p><p>Our machines are very well-located, I might add, prime beachfront property, you might say. And convenience remains a very high driver for the Australian market. We're also in discussions with a number of financial institutions in Australia about a utility concept for the market, rather like Allpoint. This could see us providing a similar service in the Australian market over time, and we believe we're well positioned to stabilize our EBITDA in Australia in 2019.</p><p>To the U.K. This is our largest market in the international business and was impacted, as you know, by forced interchange reductions at the end of 2017, which were implemented mid-'18 and January of this year. Our U.K. estate is primarily free-to-use and as such, is heavily dependent on the interchange we receive from the banks as a primary source of revenue. We executed a series of actions, events with the regulator, with the banks, with the government and with the LINK board to successfully mitigate the proposed 20% reduction by 50%, by half, and we've spoken about this on several of our earnings calls.</p><p>We have taken many actions through '18 to optimize and rightsize our business in the U.K. and to ensure that we retain our profitability. We have reduced expense across the board and focused on profitability per machine, which has seen the removal of some 3,000 machines, less profitable machines, from our network. This has had the added benefit of improving the performance of the remainder of our machines as volume is consolidated onto fewer devices.</p><p>We will continue to focus on these cost actions throughout 2019 and are also executing a plan to move a portion of our network to a pay-to-use model -- surcharge model, thus gaining control over our profitability and our revenue and mitigating our previous reliance on the LINK interchange model. Additionally, we are leveraging our infrastructure to drive new transaction volume through a series of new initiatives to ensure our return to long-term profitable growth through 2020 and beyond.</p><p>One such example of this I would like to highlight briefly is the business banking hub, which was recently made public in the press. Bank branches in the U.K. and around the world have changed personality on the High Street. They have become more like coffee shops in many respects, where banks are focused on selling more products and services, primarily to their retail clients. This has created a potential problem with respect to their small business users, who still need traditional banking services, such as check, note, coin deposit and bag drop. This problem is further exacerbated by the brand's closure program, which is continuing at pace. Ed referred to it earlier, and it's certainly in the region of 60 a month now in the U.K.</p><p>So we've been working with 3 major banks in the U.K., as I said, recently made public, Lloyd's, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, 3 of the largest, in fact, and our partner, Vaultex, to create a shared utility hub-cum-set that will effectively be an off-premise branch, specifically targeted at small businesses.</p><p>No one is better positioned to provide this service than us, and again, if you go back to my earlier slide where I referenced our tenure, our infrastructure and our level of maturity and expertise, this is one of the key factors why we were selected to provide this service. Three pilot locations are operational around the country. These are going to test the principle, test the market and the technology, with a view to roll out multiple sites at the end of '19 into '20 and beyond. This represents a great opportunity for an adjacent and innovative service, providing transaction growth and a realization of our strategy to extend into market adjacencies.</p><p>So now let me turn to our growth markets, Germany, Spain and South Africa, and I'd like to start with Germany. Germany is a fragmented banking market with an ATM structure based on surcharge, which in many respects is quite similar to the United States. This is a large cash economy and a banking sector here, as with other countries, that are reducing their number of branches. We are the largest independent operator, again referencing back to Ed's earlier remarks. In a territory as such, we have a very, very strong position for future growth. Having performed extremely well in 2018 with our increased presence, capability and recruitment drive, we see continuing growth through '19 and beyond.</p><p>Germany is also providing a very good testbed for some of our newer products. For example, we've installed a small number of deposit-capable ATMs in the market, and we're also seeing significant interest from financial institutions for co-branding arrangements, not dissimilar again to the United States. We're building a strong FI program in Germany to complement our presence in retail and corporate. And most recently, we successfully implemented a co-branding deal with PostBank, one of Germany's largest banks. Not only is this a major win for Cardtronics, it is notable because it is the first time we have secured a significant bank partnership in this market, which augurs very well for the future of our business in Germany.</p><p>2018 also saw our largest single deployment partnership, a new relationship with Total, one of Germany's largest petrol retailers. They've signed a contract with us to place ATMs across their franchise, and these high footfall locations provide an excellent opportunity for us to capture new profitable transaction volume.</p><p>So to Spain, one of the world's key tourist destinations, and a very heavy British tourist presence, I might add, in particular, and they are obviously very familiar with us and with our brand based on our U.K. presence. This territory performed extremely well for us in '18, and we expect to double the ATM footprint in 2019 in highly profitable locations.</p><p>And as bank branches continue to decline, more and more opportunities are opening up for us with financial institutions. For example, again, recently publicized, we have just completed the rollout of a deal with ING Bank, which provides them with co-branded presence across our network, and we're also working with them to identify sites where we can place new machines co-branded in partnership with them. This arrangement has now been in place for a number of months, and we are already seeing a significant rise in surcharge-free ING card volume across our network.</p><p>In many respects, our most mature growth market is South Africa. This was borne of an acquisition in 2017, and this business continues to break records, break records for installation, break records for transaction volume, quarter after quarter. It's being driven by a very strong cash-based economy and our strategy of targeted ATM placements in high-volume locations. We are the second largest IAD in a very strong market for us, particularly as our relationships with major FIs continue to drive large placement volume for us on top of our presence in corporate and retail accounts.</p><p>This excellent growth is expected to continue through 2019 and beyond. And some recent successes that I might like to reference include Capitec, for example, the fastest-growing bank in South Africa. We have approximately 2,000 bank-branded but nonbranch ATMs today, and it's a very strong relationship growing very healthily. This deal sits alongside others that add to our story of long-term sustainable growth. And in particular, I'd like to call out Old Mutual, which is the largest, the oldest financial institution in South Africa, where we have a very solid relationship.</p><p>As you have seen, the international portfolio is a valuable element of Cardtronics' global business. We generate a significant amount of free cash flow from the U.K. and Australia, in particular. Double-digit growth, top and bottom line, in our growth markets is expected to continue as we invest further, producing the opportunities to extend into the cash value chain in all markets, which we see as providing leverage in our other markets as they develop and are proven to be successful. We are positioned to grow our EBITDA for the consolidated international segment in 2020 and beyond. Effectively, some of the headwinds that we mentioned earlier have been muscled through, as Ed put it in one of his recent earnings calls.</p><p>I believe we have rightsized the solid foundation within our mature market upon which to build. We will drive transaction growth and profitability through existing prime locations, as I mentioned in our growth markets, and adding new products and services, thus driving the total entity. The same time, manage the real expansion we have in our growth markets through ATM deployment. We believe we will return to growth across the international business as a whole, with continued execution through 2020 and beyond.</p><p>And with that, I would like to hand over to Gary Ferrera, our CFO. Thank you.</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA, CFO, CARDTRONICS PLC: Thank you, Marc, and welcome, everyone. As you can see, the company has delivered strong revenue and EBITDA growth over the years, with CAGRs of 11% and 14%, respectively. There is a slight misconception that this has mostly been driven by M&amp;A. In reality, it has been a combination of both organic growth and M&amp;A.</p><p>In reality -- I'm sorry. We have now fully cycled on 7-Eleven as you can see. In 2017, 7-Eleven was a significant part of our revenue at 12.5% and with 40% margins. This was a very unique situation. We have strong -- long-term relationships with most of our retail partners. Additionally, no one retailer makes up more than 6% of our revenues. Based on what the team has presented so far, we believe the best opportunities for growth going forward come from driving more transactions over our existing network, especially in North America.</p><p>Moving on to the next slide. Not only the company grown revenue and EBITDA over the years, it has consistently generated free cash flow. Our network is an efficient generator of cash and as Marc mentioned earlier, especially in our mature markets. These cash flows have allowed the company to quickly pay down debt over the years from past acquisitions. In summary, while our CapEx investment varies year-to-year due to growth initiatives and other factors, Cardtronicsconsistently delivers a significant amount of cash flow.</p><p>On the next slide, we present cash allocation over the last 5 years. Regardless of acquisition activity, the company has always made capital investments in the business. The remainder of the cash was used for acquisitions and debt paydown, primarily related to those acquisitions. As most of you know, in 2018, we shifted our priorities to focus on organic growth and debt reduction. These will continue to be top priorities in 2019. In 2018, there is no wide blue column up there because we did no acquisitions in 2018. One thing that I want to note is that in 2020 and in 2021, we'll have payments due to an earn-out related to our 2017 acquisition of Spark in South Africa.</p><p>Before we get to our longer-term outlook, let's take a moment to review our 2018 accomplishments. To begin with, we focused on a new -- on our new priority of driving organic growth and durability in our revenue streams. We grew same-store transactions over 6% in the United States, which drove -- or helped drive 4% revenue growth for the North American segment, excluding 7-Eleven. We also saw double-digit growth in our international growth markets.</p><p>Contributing to our 2018 performance was our focus on operational excellence and portfolio optimization. We can see these in record-high network availability, continued fleet optimization, especially in our mature markets, and our focus on upgrading systems, such as our new ERP deployment. Finally, getting to the bottom line, we had almost 60% growth in adjusted free cash flow for the year, and we reduced debt by $113 million. In addition, we did a refinancing, which will allow us greater flexibility in future capital allocation.</p><p>Now let's look at 2018 through the lens of our guidance progression during the year. Coming into 2018, we faced much uncertainty. We had the transition of a major relationship with -- a retailer relationship with 7-Eleven, changes in the Australian banking landscape, LINK rate cuts in the U.K. and a relatively new management team focused on a shift on priorities.</p><p>Looking at this sequentially, in Q1, we saw better-than-expected U.S. same-store sales, U.K. property tax benefit and an FX tailwind. That FX tailwind continued into Q2. We also, in Q2, had improved global transaction trends. Australia performed better than we anticipated, and we had record uptime. In Q3, we had continued record uptime and continued record availability. We believe much of the success during the year was a product of both the team's ability to execute on our key priorities and better-than-expected market conditions, and we are now in an excellent position to capitalize on these growth opportunities we discussed earlier.</p><p>Now I'd like to take a moment to reiterate our 2019 outlook. Revenue is $1.31 billion to $1.35 billion. This will be driven by growth in North America, led by surcharge-free, continued growth in Germany, Spain and South Africa from new placements. This will all be offset by continued headwinds in the U.K. and Australia.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA is going to be in the range of $285 million to $295 million. This takes into account the LINK interchange reductions in the U.K., the previous year's property tax benefit recorded in the first half, along with the first half currency tailwinds, partly offset by solid growth in the U.S. and the international growth markets.</p><p>Adjusted EPS is going to be in the range of $1.94 to $2.05 per share. This will be impacted by higher depreciation from shorter-lived assets, partly offset by lower interest expense due to our refinancing. Lastly, CapEx will approximate $135 million as we invest in new capabilities and additional placements.</p><p>This next slide should look familiar. We use these bridges as a supplement on our most recent earnings call, and it's a more detailed view of revenue and EBITDA from 2018 through 2019. The points I raised in the previous slide add to an approximate $30 million headwind for EBITDA for 2019. This is a tale of 2 halves as the majority of this is weighted to the first half of the year, these headwinds is to the first half of the year. We anticipate organic growth and positive operating leverage will assist us in growing through these headwinds throughout the year.</p><p>And with that, let's look forward to our 2- to 4-year outlook. First, let's focus on our largest segment, North America. We expect the majority of our growth to come from surcharge-free and Managed Services. As Brian and Brad mentioned, this will be delivered by new product initiatives for financial institutions, such as deposit-taking capabilities with Allpoint+, mobile and cardless features available through ATM mobile cash. We will also grow through proven surcharge-free offerings, such as traditional bank branding and Allpoint access. We will continue to leverage the platform to grow transactions with financial institutions. And finally, we expect Managed Services to continue to grow as financial institutions seek more cost-effective ways to operate.</p><p>Now turning to our international segments. As you heard from Marc, growth will be more market-dependent. International growth markets will be driven by new machine deployments. In our mature markets, the U.K. and Australia, we have leading market positions and are expected to generate healthy cash flows, which was one of the reasons why we've actually moved most of our revolver borrowings into pound sterling. In summary, we anticipate returning to low single-digit top line growth across both international reporting segments during 2020.</p><p>Now let's look at the top line growth from the perspective of different revenue streams. The greatest driver of our growth in the medium term will be surcharge-free in North America. This will drive 45% of our midterm growth. We expect Managed Services in North America to drive approximately 25% of this midterm growth as we believe our platform and comprehensive solutions are a compelling value proposition for financial institutions.</p><p>Finally, just less than 1/3 of our revenue growth is expected to come from areas such as surcharge, predominantly from new placements in international growth markets. We expect these drivers to deliver revenue growth of 3% to 5% over the midterm.</p><p>Now let's discuss some of the drivers of margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier, we have cycled through the loss of a high-margin retailer, and we'll be cycling through LINK interchange reductions throughout the year. These declines in revenues pressured margins even with significant mitigation efforts. Returning to revenue growth, we'll provide natural margin leverage, which will be even more accretive as we drive incremental transactions across the existing asset base. We'll also continue our focus on operational excellence by continuing to optimize the fleet, continuing to integrate systems and processes as well as many other initiatives. These multiple levers will allow us to grow adjusted EBITDA in excess of revenue growth.</p><p>We'll now turn our focus to capital investments. Over the last few years, we have invested approximately 50% of our capital towards growth, and we expect about a 50-50 split in 2019. The remainder of capital investment is focused on maintenance and infrastructure development. This has ranged between 3% to 5% of revenue over time.</p><p>Our reduced growth capital investment in 2018 was driven by fleet reallocation, for example, when we moved machines from Poland to Germany as well as use of warehouse inventory post 7-Eleven. Normalizing for this would have resulted in closer to a 50-50 split we have seen recently and anticipate in 2019. 2019 investments will be driven by enhanced functionality, new product and new placements.</p><p>Now let me summarize our medium-term outlook. Based on what you've heard from the team about the strength of our network and product offerings, combined with the market backdrop, we believe a revenue goal of 3% to 5% is achievable. The combination of this top line growth and the resulting natural operating leverage, along with a company-wide focus on operational excellence, should drive 7% to 9% EBITDA growth. Finally, we will continue to focus on disciplined capital allocation, resulting in annual CapEx investment of approximately 8% to 10% of revenues. As we've mentioned throughout the day, we anticipate achieving these results organically. No acquisitions are assumed in this outlook.</p><p>Let me conclude by discussing our view on capital allocation priorities. First, our best prospects fit within our market-leading ATM network. Capital invested in adding network capabilities for our growing list of financial institution partners is priority #1. Second, we continue to target net leverage in the range of 2 to 2.5x. We anticipate achieving this in late 2019 or early 2020. Finally, we believe shareholder return options will become available as we approach our target net leverage range. Most likely, these would include programmatic share repurchases and/or dividends. As Ed previously mentioned last evening, we announced an opportunistic share repurchase program of $50 million. Keyword here is opportunistic.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Ed.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Great, Gary. Very good. So we've gone through a lot of information here today. We've been looking forward to sharing the story with you, and I really want to focus on some of the key takeaways. As Gary just summarized a minute ago, we feel confident in the ability to deliver what we see is the near-term, medium-term outlook for the company, a growth of 3% to 5% in revenue and 7% to 9% in EBITDA growth over the medium term. Now this is driven by what we see is the secular trend that's beginning to occur in, frankly, all of the markets in which we operate. I spent a fair amount of time focusing on the United States, of where, informed based on those conversations with leading financial institutions, FinTechs and big tech, all have seen this opportunity with the shift in trend to capitalize on what we believe in the U.S. to be a $15 billion market that will begin to open up.</p><p>Through a combination of those products, the enhancements that we've made, the new products as well as our end-to-end platform that's quite unique, we believe bringing those together, we can deliver value for all of our important partners, most notably the retailers, the financial institutions and those FinTech businesses. All will culminate into earnings growth and value creation for us as owners going forward.</p><p>So with that, what we'd like to do is open up to some questions of the group. And what we're going to encourage everybody to do is, to those who have a question, is to introduce themselves, and the names because this is all webcast. Obviously, give me your seat here. So to give us your name first as we go through. Going over here. Yes?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI, PARTNER AND CO-GROUP HEAD OF FINANCIAL SERVICES &amp; TECHNOLOGY, WILLIAM BLAIR &amp; COMPANY L.L.C., RESEARCH DIVISION: Bob Napoli from William Blair. The North America growth mid- to high single digit, and you break that out, I think, 45% from surcharge-free, 25% from Managed Services. In the surcharge-free area, I was hoping you could maybe dig into that a little bit more and to how much of this is coming from bank branding versus Allpoint versus new services, like deposits. And then maybe if you could size the relative importance of Allpoint versus bank branding.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Great question. They're all important. So we approach this through the lens of Managed Services -- excuse me, all through that, the whole surcharge-free network and both the combination of Allpoint as well as the bank branding approach. So when we have a conversation with the financial institution based on any size, each institution is a little bit different. Some are interested and want to start off with Allpoint. Others maybe want to work for that presence, as Brian was talking about earlier. What we wanted to do is establish the relationships, deliver value for them and see that expand over time. Obviously, the way we've designed all this is to encourage as much as possible because it helps the overall network in that surcharge-free. So we will work with both ways. And in the 45% is the combination of all of those. It's Allpoint, it's branding, it's growth. Obviously, we're early days. We're just announcing the deposit-taking with the expectations for deposit as more and more of those deposits come off of the branch. We don't have a specific breakdown that we're outlining for that in terms of the composition within that 45%.</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI: Okay. And just a follow-up question, if I could. On the mobile side, first of all, how many of your ATMs today are mobile-equipped? And then you had a phone up there, with it had Venmo and Square and a number of other FinTechs, PayPal on there. Do you have relationships with those companies today, or are those companies that you expect or hope to have relationships with?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes, while -- today, we have about 11,000. Brad, who really talked about this, maybe talk a little bit more about the relationships and what you had on there.</p><p>JOSEPH BRADLEY NOLAN: Yes, so as Ed indicated, we've rolled out the new software to roughly 1,000 -- or 11,000 ATMs. In the next 60 days or so, we should reach roughly 18,000, with a program target of hitting roughly 30,000. While we don't have contractual relationships yet with any of the logos and we had the fine print up on the screen, you can rest assure that we do have relationships with them, we're talking with them about their interest in ATM mobile cash. So really spent the better part of the past year, it was in the FinTech sector, and again, this is the big household names you know and these are the small guys you've never heard of before. But with the introduction of the API, which is actually rolling out here in the next 30 days, we're expecting some -- a high degree of interest.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: I think one of the learnings that Brad mentioned on during his presentations -- presentation is what a lot of those organizations are learning the importance of cash, of having that connectivity to cash, sort that they want their application to become top of app or top of wallet of having that cash connectivity. And obviously, as we walk through here, no one else has our convenience, accessibility and control around that network to be able to allow that API to come in, direct connect into our network and tailor that experience for their customer at this location and allow that cash in, cash out.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask you about...</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Ramsey, do you want to introduce yourself?</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL: I'm sorry. Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Appreciate it for reminding me. So how should we think about your same-store withdrawal rate? This past year, there was a lot of great inputs there that maybe won't be recurring like the Allpoint recapture. How do we look -- how should we think about that same-store rate kind of trending over time?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes. So on the same-store transaction, we talked a lot about, obviously, the recapture, with the change from 7-Eleven. And as we illustrate and you saw on that surcharge-free network, we saw double-digit surcharge-free transaction growth on that network excluding 7-Eleven because a lot of those transactions were recaptured. And we were very clear throughout the year talking about that was a big driver also of the growth. And more recently, more of that has been moderating, where last quarter our total withdrawal was between 5% and 6%. We would expect that to continue to moderate. And obviously, you're going to have some quarters where it looks really strong and some where it doesn't. Candidly, like in surcharge-free, well, look at the United Kingdom, a big factor on that is completely out of our control called the weather of what we see what happens in the U.K. So it's not going to be straight, linear. But what you can, rest assured, across this organization, people are very aligned to how we are continuing to have deeper relationships with those financial institutions, with the retailers to encourage more and more traffic and visits and functionality and use in driving more and more transactions, and we're all aligned to that.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL: And one follow-up for me. An increasing area of interest for investors is on the contactless card rollout in the U.S. A lot of the banks are talking about it. I know that the U.S. is a complicated landscape in terms of merchant adoption, et cetera, but how are you framing that up now in terms of the potential unpack of contactless on the business?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Sure. Well, we benefit by, obviously, our global reach. We operate in Australia. Australia, where that's been rolled out, and very mature there, and understand how it has worked there. We see it in the United Kingdom. United Kingdom has been fairly mature. So we benefit by seeing the various characteristics in each of these markets. As we all know, the United States is very different, obviously. It is rolling out, it will, and it will be used in functionality, but the structure of the U.S. is quite different than where we've seen that in other places around the world. You have many more financial institutions, you have many more retailers across the organization and different competing interests for that. We believe it will be a driver and contactless will be used. But candidly, the underlying reason for that is also a beneficiary to us because of our network. It's a supporting thesis to that large market that we believe is opening up as the financial institutions continue to pull back on that cash infrastructure, which they supply over 90% of those transactions now, as they pull back on that, being that one of the drivers leads into opportunity for us. So to the best extent possible, we try to factor that in into our outlook that we have, and that's been informed by what we've seen in other countries around the world. Kartik?</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA, EXECUTIVE MD, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, PRINCIPAL &amp; EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, NORTHCOAST RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Ed, as you -- maybe, Gary, this is a question for you. As you approach your 3% to 5% revenue growth rate, what kind of assumptions are you making for the U.K. and Australia? Will it be similar kind of negative 1%, or do you anticipate that those -- that market -- or those 2 markets changing at all to try to get to your 3% to 5% revenue growth?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: Yes. As Marc mentioned during his section, I mean, obviously, we've got those international growth markets in the EMEA segment and across the International. So we expect, as we said, probably 2020 and beyond to be growing in low-single digits coming out of that and that's what's included in the plan, and those offsetting each other, obviously.</p><p>KARTIK MEHTA: And then just on your Allpoint+ deployment, how many ATMs do think you'll deploy over the next 24 months for this Allpoint+ network?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: Yes. I think over a 24-month period is a little harder to say. I'd say, maybe by the end of the year, you might have something like 1,000 out there. But over time, we've got to see what the take-up is and how much penetrated we need to be into the market to have the right scale. That's sort of still learning point for us.</p><p>STEVEN MARK WILSON, MD, FOUNDER, CIO, ANALYST, AND MANAGER, LAPIDES ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC: Steve Wilson, Lapides Asset Management. A couple of questions. The first one is, you showed, obviously, such a dichotomy internationally between some of your markets being mature and declining, others growing. Do you look at that and say, \"We need to plant a couple of more seeds in growing markets\"? I mean looking at a South Africa or even a Germany, you've got a nice base, but quite small in comparison. Is this a motivator to say, \"Let's find a few more markets like that and get going, or that's too far, that's not to be concerned with now and push that out a bit\"?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes. I don't know if everybody heard the question, it gets back to looking at new markets for expansion. I believe, I would never say never, but we are relentlessly focused on, as we've talked about our priorities in terms of where we see the opportunities in our existing markets. We have a huge installed base right here in North America where we're going to be doing a lot more. We're growing very nicely in reallocated resources. We -- one of our primary goal is deploying capital to its highest and best use, and we see significant opportunity in those markets in which we operate today. And yes, as you point out, South Africa, Spain and Germany, which is why we redeployed some of those resources from Poland into those markets and feel like we have a long runway for growth. But the largest value creators, as I said in the last earnings call, we believe, over the medium term, will be this significant opportunity here in North America. And we don't want anything to distract us from that. Over time, we'll analyze things and look at the market in due process.</p><p>STEVEN MARK WILSON: And then the second question, the picture and I forgot the title that you used. But the U.K. small business bank consortium, whatever it is, I am completely unclear what you're doing in that mode. I mean, who is taking on the lease expense? How is this working that multiple banks are working together and where you're involved versus them?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Right. Let me come back to that one. Did you have something on the last -- okay. So on that, you're talking about the hub, which is called the Business Banking Hub. As Marc pointed out, it's a pilot. So we're 3 of the largest financial institutions in the United Kingdom came together and are running this pilot, looking at their small to medium business enterprises, as they pull back on branches and their branch footprint has left a gap for business banking in a lot of these communities. So they've refocused that and now they're looking for a partner to help support that consolidation, which has been happening around the country. We partnered, as Marc mentioned, with a firm called Vaultex to provide a solution for their small, medium sized enterprises to handle the cash, coin deposits needs in and out on principally, not totally, but principally in an automated way. It's a pilot, we'll see how it evolves. What we've shared with you today is not reflected in the outlook on that. It's an early stage pilot, and we'll see how it evolves and how -- what those institutions want to do with it. I will say though, as I mentioned earlier, one of the favorite things I enjoy doing is going around and meeting with financial institutions around the world, there is a lot of interest around the world, and principally also here in North America, on seeing how well this works. Because the similarities of that goes back to that same thesis we talked about earlier where that -- where institutions are wanting to pull back and possibly that could be a solution, but we'll let time tell.</p><p>OSCAR D. TURNER, ASSOCIATE, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Oscar Turner from SunTrust. First question is on Allpoint+. Just wondering, to what extent has deposit taking been a gating item to bank outsourcing? And then can you give any color on how the unit economics of the new machines differ?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Okay. So on Allpoint+, I've noted -- the first part of your question about in terms of the outsourcing relative to deposits?</p><p>OSCAR D. TURNER: Sure. Just now that you have this deposit taking capability, has that accelerated your conversations with banks, and do you see that as -- is that, should we say a step function change in bank interest, given that now you have this?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes, so let me start on that and have Brian step in as well. Obviously what we've designed and developed there, and as Brad mentioned, tip-to-toe on design of that machine and functionality with Allpoint+, so that it would fit in one of our top retailer relationships and where we see a lot of transaction opportunity. And being able to have both cash in, cash out, ultimately it's a recycler and has recycling capabilities as well. And over time, we would expect to see that working with financial institutions to be able to help pull traffic off of the teller. Our design and intent and our rolling out this product was very informed with conversations with multiple financial institutions, but also talking to that interest then on the FinTech side. Brian, you want to elaborate any more there?</p><p>BRIAN JOSEPH BAILEY: Yes. Let me talk about the 2 offers, right. So one offer is managed services, where we takeover a bank's infrastructure, including deposit taking ATMs; the other is offering a deposit utility, which multiple banks can visit. The foundational elements of both of those offers are very similar, right. So the ability to clear check through a system in a back-end process is important to FIs. How we handle disputes and settlement and regulatory items, very similar. So the foundation of the platform, supported by Stuart and his team, is very similar across both offers, so it has helped us to accelerate our managed services discussions with small and medium FIs. So the same capabilities that apply to the Allpoint+ offer also apply to bank managed services, and that's why it's allowing us to just get more aggressive in the marketplace at that end-to-end solution.</p><p>OSCAR D. TURNER: Okay. And then second question, just a follow-up on your commentary on geo mix. I was wondering, would you consider divesting any of the rest of world businesses, just given some of the external headwinds you're facing there? And then also, it seems like a pretty attractive opportunity here in the U.S.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Oscar, I apologize. Certainly, it's really hard to hear. You're saying investing in which....</p><p>OSCAR D. TURNER: Would you consider divesting any of the rest of the world businesses, given some of the external headwinds you're facing there?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Oh, yes. So we're -- I mean, for example, where you see a fair amount of some of the deployment on the growth really are in those growth countries. And putting new ATM deployments out in Spain, Germany, South Africa, is a fair amount of investment. And obviously, those markets where we are today is a lot smaller, but growing rapidly. Around the United Kingdom and Australia, it is a high and ardent focus on cash generation, optimization of the portfolio, but also meeting with and discussing with other financial institutions and retailers to see if there is more opportunity. But right now, till the markets stabilize, we're going to be highly focused on generating the cash flow. Do you want to, Gary, anything else to add in there?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: No. I'd just reiterate the same thing. I mean those are highly cash-generative countries, so we're very focused. And I think one of the reasons for showing the hub is to get -- give an idea of some of things we're thinking about in these countries.</p><p>JUSTIN LAURENCE BERGNER, VP, G. RESEARCH, LLC: Justin Bergner with G. Research. Given in 2018, you had U.S. same-store sales transaction growth of 6%, North American revenue growth of 4%, it seems like there is a delta, call it 100 to 200 basis points of price mix headwind between transactions as they filter down to revenue. Is that sort of correct assumption going forward? And if so, does that mean that the mid-single-digit-plus North American revenue growth is actually going to have to be a little bit higher on a transaction basis to achieve your midterm guidance?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: Yes. I mean I wouldn't use that exact math because you were talking about United States and North America. But the general thesis, obviously, when you look at a surcharge-free transaction, we're trying to drive volume there. So yes, your number of transactions would have to be a little bit higher.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Looking at specifically last year, it's a little bit apples and oranges because the revenue -- the total revenue in that segment versus the 6% with same-store transactions, right. So you're missing that same-store is not the whole portfolio, so that was -- it's -- those 2 aren't completely connected.</p><p>JUSTIN LAURENCE BERGNER: And then a second question sort of on your midterm views. Are you assuming any growth in your number of ATMs? Or is this all number of transaction share of wallet growth?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: It's primarily share of wallet. I mean when you look at the global growth countries, in those countries, you'll see increasing count, but in the other countries, you see that we're trying to optimize. So there may be some drops in those countries. So it's a bit of a mix, but it's not driven off of a large number of ATM increases.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: And in particular, as Gary pointed back on the international side, here in North America, in the U.S., we expect to continue to grow with our wonderful retail relationships. As they grow and move into new markets, they are optimizing their markets as well. And to the extent we see growth there, we will look forward to growing with them.</p><p>JUSTIN LAURENCE BERGNER: Okay. Maybe I'll just jump in one more and then get back in the queue. I guess the managed services growth in North America, that's only about 8% of your total revenue, but that's going to drive 25% of the revenue growth in your waterfall chart. It wasn't something that you spent as much time on today. Just maybe help us understand how that small portion of revenue drives such a large portion of your revenue growth? And what are the drivers there?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: So the managed services segment today is about 9% of total revenues. As I mentioned earlier, the lion's share of that historically has been managing processing for merchants, retailers and smaller financial institutions for years, primarily a transaction-based revenue source and volume, long-term agreement, the transaction basis. And typically revenues, think about that in terms of so many cents per transaction with that growth. We also have been working with financial institutions where we manage their on-premise and off-premise portfolios to the tune of several thousand ATMs globally. We've been doing that in North America and in the U.S. for years, but also through the last acquisition also picked up a fair amount in both Canada and Australia. That's informed our ability to see this, again, secular trend and shift that we see in financial services. With them continuing to pull back, that's a growing opportunity to offer that full function, full outsource support and the way we're delivering that is on that integrated platform of delivery. That same team, same capabilities, same processing that we're doing for the network, surcharge-free network, same thing we're doing for surcharge leveraging that same skill, leveraging expertise. That growth, those were large relationships that we see continuing to open up, which results in being roughly about 25% of that growth potential.</p><p>MARTIN JI, DIRECTOR, SENIOR PORTFOLIO ANALYST &amp; GENERALIST, CLEARBRIDGE INVESTMENTS, LLC: Martin Ji from ClearBridge. In the recent past, you have the EVA -- EMV upgrades that impact your uptime. So for this new round of upgrade for the -- either mobile cash or the Allpoint+, what -- how much confidence do you have in terms of executing on that without impacting your up-time for those initiatives?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes. I know it's just tough hearing. Unfortunately, there's an air thing. But I believe what you're talking about is the availability in terms of uptime on the new functionality. That's...</p><p>MARTIN JI: Yes. In comparison to the EVA (sic) [EMV] experience you had in the past, which did impact your uptime quite a bit.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Okay, the EMV standpoint. So let's separate the 2, which, obviously, there is a rollout from EMV that the company rolled out a couple of years ago -- or several years ago based on some developments that happened a long time ago. Unfortunately, just the idea of putting EMV on an ATM is not significant. Obviously, it was significant for Cardtronics because it was such a large footprint in the United States. The issue there was it was combined with some other activities and ultimately, the consequence impacted the EMV. This is why what we've done is, this team has been very focused on execution, operations, integrating our platform, consolidating our technology and operations, development capabilities, and design this product, as Brad said, from tip to tail, in terms of how we operate it and rolling out and running, testing it and then getting it out into the market. It's out here operating right now, and we're doing a measured rollout of this over time. Versus combined with a bunch of other things that were done at that point in time on top of a 50,000-plus ATM rollout of EMV, which was done several years ago. Very different approach, disciplined approach and about how we do -- go about it.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH NABHAN, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Chuck Nabhan, Wells Fargo. I wanted to get your comments on the opportunity in such value-add products as digital gift cards, which you touched on a little bit earlier, but I wanted to get a better idea of where you are in that process and how you perceive that opportunity over the long-term?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes. As everybody heard around, like digital gift cards, I think it's a great idea. This is one of the things that we're so enthusiastic about rolling out these capabilities that we are introducing today. Whether it's that functionality of both cash in, cash out, opening up an API, which is an aperture that allows for multiple transaction types that can come into our network. And then that network being at all those very valuable, high convenient locations across the country, that's merely one type of transaction. Brad mentioned either you could look at that, you could look at bill pay, you could look at transfer, you could look at a whole host of different activities, think about the FinTechs coming in, as I mentioned in my opening statements. What we view the company longer term or -- is a digital or a physical kiosk, opening up a broadening set of transactions at a retailer near you. So that's merely one, that's something for the future. That's not what we're talking about today, but I think that could be down the road.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH NABHAN: Just had a quick follow-up. Wanted to get your comments on the regulatory security environment and whether you see that as a competitive benefit to Cardtronics?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes, the regulatory environment, obviously, all over the world, every country, every country has its unique issues and considerations. That's actually one of the benefits for Cardtronics because we're global in nature. We see different developments that are happening in different parts of the world, and we can move quickly on that and understanding that, that's why -- one of our compliance, security and protocols is consolidated and central. And then we have team members in each of the countries where we do, so we share information very rapidly. I completely agree here around, it is paramount and fundamental for us to be able to capitalize on that emerging opportunity, which is why one of the reasons we invested so heavily in our information security, the protocols around that. We get audited by multiple financial institutions all over the world, frankly, almost daily because of the interest in terms of what they're doing. So we're very used to it, accustomed to it, and now we're in a position where we can share different protocols with them as well. So it's, I believe, a very strong point, and it's hard for anybody to replicate because of our global breadth.</p><p>REGINALD LAWRENCE SMITH, COMPUTER SERVICES AND IT CONSULTING ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Reggie Smith with JPMorgan. So you guys have done a good job of really kind of emphasizing the value of your kind of 2-sided network. There was a slide that showed, I guess some of the savings that you are able to generate for your bank partners. And I am curious, have you guys started to think about -- or rethink the way you kind of price these services? And is there an opportunity to kind of price more for value on some of the things, whether it's Allpoint or I guess it's very early in the managed service days, but like how you guys are thinking about pricing for those services?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Brian, do you want to take it here for North America?</p><p>BRIAN JOSEPH BAILEY: Yes. Good question, Reggie. This has been a significant transformation initiative for us, as we educate, enable our sales force to think differently about how we bring value to our customers. We come from a world of independent deployment, but we're increasingly moving to a world where we are trying to quantify not just top line growth benefit, but also retention benefit and operational savings benefit, as you heard Brad talk about earlier. And I would say, we've always been a value-based pricer, right. Our Allpoint proposition is a value-based solution, and we expect that to continue with not just branding but managed services and really our entire proposition. The good news is, we're now expanding our reach from traditionally an ATM channel manager at our FI base to head of retail distribution. Because while our solutions are ATM-related, they impact dramatically physical distribution for an FI. When we can get to that ahead of retail distribution and talk about how we can help specific market growth and the revenue and operational cost drivers around it, that's where our sweet spot is and that's where value comes into play.</p><p>REGINALD LAWRENCE SMITH: Got it. And if I could sneak 2 quick ones in. Thinking about the deposit opportunity, is that something that's going to be, at least a revenue model, is that dictated by the network? So is that something that you guys can price kind of like Allpoint, where you set your own price for that? And then the second question is, you alluded to investing more in the Allpoint brand in the next few years. I know you're 4% of [overall] transactions in the U.S. Do you have a sense of your, I guess, kind of wallet share amongst Allpoint cards, and what that kind of latent opportunity may be? I know I gave you a lot there.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Yes, that's a great one. So on the first, around deposit, we're rolling this out, this is Allpoint+ deposit, so it's based on the Allpoint network. And the structure on that is a combination of both fixed fees for network access for deposits plus transactions. So that's how it's structured there. Looking at overall around -- on the second part of your question, it gets me into overall what the market on for Allpoint in terms of the number out there. Absolutely, which is why we go into those 1000-plus financial institutions, which we're on the left side of that 2-sided network. Our ability to engender greater relationships with those financial institutions and partnership with them, some of the things that Brian talked about, more knowledge and awareness to their card members about the benefit, the more of these institutions start recognizing the benefit. And as we're showing them the quantifiable and tangible value and as they pull back on theirs, they will -- we believe continuing to encourage the use of the network. And one -- metric standpoint, we would like to begin sort of working with them and measuring the penetration across that portfolio and awareness. And this also gets back to why, as I mentioned earlier, bringing the Chief -- the CMO into it and thinking about the B2B2C. Today, our teams are working through this and having a dedicated focus how we're working there enhancing that awareness and further penetration just among that installed base. We love to bring in, and we will continue to bring in new relationships, but just expanding more on that install. And Bob, you had a...</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI: Just on the North America growth, the bank branding and surcharge-free, is -- or bank-branding Allpoint, is that a double-digit growth business? I know you had double-digit transactions, but are you -- to get to mid- to high-single-digit North America growth, maybe break that down, same-store sales, bank branding, surcharge-free revenue growth would be helpful.</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: Yes, I mean, we haven't given out that detail. And when you think about it, I mean it's -- we go out to the solution provider, Brian and his team, when they're meeting with people. So to get specific as to whether it'd be Allpoint deposits, Allpoint+ or something else, we're not providing that information right now.</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI: But you would expect the bank branding in Allpoint to be the fastest growth piece of it? And is there pricing compression, or is it just mix related?</p><p>GARY W. FERRERA: No. I don't think it's pricing compression. But yes, we expect those to be high-growth areas.</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the U.K. I mean, that's still a big market for you. Do you expect growth to resume in the U.K. in 2020? And how has the shift gone? I mean the strategy there, you've taken a number of ATMs from free-to-use to pay-to-use, how is that going and do you expect more shift in the U.K.?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Sure, yes. So just stepping back, I mean the U.K. obviously has been going through a lot of change based on the pricing changes to the broad-based free-to-use environment, which was established in change because of LINK's actions. And as Marc mentioned, the second of those actions took place just this past quarter in January, so the market is still digesting that. We've been proactive on that. We pulled capacity based on those changes, where you may have had a marginal performer, now is not performing, so we pulled it out of the market. Others that we fear were going to be better on a pay-to-use basis and have been going through that conversion. We believe through this year, the market should stabilize, through this year and see what the implications are, and then we'll move forward from there. I think the kind of the concern for the country, frankly, has been the disruption to this terrific free-to-use environment for the citizens of the United Kingdom. And that's having an impact in particular in the rural communities, not as much on High Street because you have multiple, but even to some degree there because the banks are continuing to pull their ATMs, but in particular in those rural communities. And that's where we're also working on different solutions to help support those communities, working with government, working with LINK, working with financial institutions and trying to do other things to help support those areas. We'll come back to you all and talk about more and see what all develops and advances. But I would just say sitting here today, we have a pretty sizable headwind, obviously, this year. But just like we muscled through the actions with 7-Eleven we'll soar through. Marc and the team in the U.K. have been a terrific job, reworking some of the network, our position and we'll see how the back half of this year performs out and then from these pilots and also the rule and report back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And if we could go back to the managed services part of the business, a couple questions just to understand that better. What would you consider your sweet spot? Like what number of ATMs does a bank or a credit union have that you would say this is a really sweet spot for Cardtronics and this is where we could win? I mean who do you consider your competitors? And maybe just one more on that, how do banks look at the return on investment when they look at trying to outsource. So maybe start with the bottom and...</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Brian, you want to jump in on it?</p><p>BRIAN JOSEPH BAILEY: Yes. In terms of the sweet spot, I think our current customer base has trended primarily between 50 and 150 ATMs, that's sort of the target market we've been successful with. In any sale of managed services, it's a strategic enterprise decision for an FI to outsource their channel. So whether it's a top 10 bank or a top 200 bank, the time and effort and diligence it takes to make that sort of selection takes time. Our sales process, our business value calculators and our operational readiness is better than ever. So we are shrinking our sales cycles down, but in many cases, these are long stage sort of relationship development. Going forward, we do expect to be able to service customers with up to 500 ATMs, right. So we think we can go upmarket a bit, but also we're more excited as well to go down market. How do we make this offer consumable to banks with less than 20 ATMs? We have to do it in a very different way, very clean, very crisp and very programmatic, but we think that also is a value proposition for us. So that's where we've been spending our time, and I think the teams have been very successful today, and we have an increasing pipeline of activity across our managed services opportunities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And just the competitors, who would you consider your competitors?</p><p>BRIAN JOSEPH BAILEY: Competitors. Yes, so we are -- as we talked about today, our end-to-end platform is very unique in the industry. We see competitors who do a portion of what we do. They may supply technology, they may supply break/fix maintenance, but very few can offer that end-to-end capability in a business that wakes up every day thinking about ATMs. There's a number of companies that offer the end-to-end, but it's a very minor, small part of their business, where they're not innovating and investing in the technology like we are. So we've been very lucky. When we can get a customer to that decision to truly outsource the managed services, we've been very successful with our win rates.</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: I just want to emphasize the point Brian was making. When we first really started rolling this out in the U.S. and focusing on it 1.5 year ago, it was around that sweet spot, that has broadened out and, as just mentioned, up to 500 or even lower. What we're talking about in the longer term, that number will continue to get larger as we bring more and more onto our platform and a disciplined rollout and interest level from financial institutions. So we look at that total market opportunity as -- and Brad mentioned in his comments, we see even going up to the largest financial institutions for their off-premise locations. And this has just been a disciplined rollout, and we're having conversations with all sized institutions now. Let's take one last question. Any others? I think I may have been -- Bob -- we're going...</p><p>ROBERT PAUL NAPOLI: Bob Napoli from William Blair. One last one. Just you put out there a TAM of $15 billion, and I assume that's a North -- I think that was a North America or U.S. TAM. I was just wondering how you built up to that TAM? And what do you think that TAM is going to do over the next few years?</p><p>EDWARD H. WEST: Sure. So that TAM is a total of $15 billion, we showed on that slide, looking at the whole market, what we believe that that will look like by the year 2022. So 5 years out, as this grows for that whole 5. The way we get there is by taking a very detailed look of how -- what we think the market from an approach based on solutions that are out there, whether that would be through a surcharge-free network, whether that would be through managed services, whether it's withdrawals or deposits looking at multiple different solutions, getting very detailed into that, and the total number of transactions. And as Brad talked about, what we see actually overall is a decline in some of those ATM transactions or withdrawals but the growth because of coming off of the teller. So we've taken all those different approaches added up, and then that's how we get to the $15 billion.</p><p>Thank you all. Thank you very much for a terrific discussion, and we look forward to keeping you posted. And thank you, again, for your support of Cardtronics.

In fact, at peak performance, the\u00a0Valley is like a self-healing organism that assiduously learns from its mistakes. During the most recent cycle, following the great dot-com collapse of 2000, the Valley almost corrected\u00a0itself out of a repeat disaster. </p><p>This time around, the consumer Web boom almost had it all. Almost.\u00a0But Silicon Valley greed and ego just couldn't help itself. And that may have drawn attention from a very unwelcome quarter: The government. Consider two of the things that made the dot-com crash so disastrous, and contrast them with the market today: First, the market for online services has grown astronomically. In the late 1990s, the hyperbole about the Web changing everything was totally true, but ahead of its time. The result: Valuations bore no relation to the underlying businesses that bore them. This time around the valuations are no less shocking, but in many cases (Uber, above all), there are real businesses supporting them\u00a0-\u00a0huge businesses that serve sometimes more than one billion people around the world. Second \u2014 and more key \u2014 is a decreased\u00a0reliance on public markets. Back in the late 1990s, success and IPOs were synonymous, and frequently companies needed the proceeds from an IPO to keep the lights on and fund their aggressive expansion plans. But that was part and parcel to the dot-com undoing. Public market investors bid these stocks up aggressively amid the pre-crash hype, and then, because they were outsiders with no vested interest in the success of the companies they owned, sold them off just as willingly once the bottom began to fall out. One reason the crash was so devastating is that it wasn't just insiders who had money at risk, it was everyday folks. Companies who were stuck being public but managed to survive the reckoning had other problems. They had to rebuild businesses in a harsh glare of demanding investors wanting quarter-to-quarter results. Look at what Yahoo \u2014 a company that once lead the Internet in eyeballs \u2014 has endured since the crash. To this day, it's never gotten out of the quarterly muck long enough to put together a plan to regain its relevance to the critically important young online audience of today. Today, successful companies are staying private longer, and only facing down the inevitable public market scrutiny once they're large and mature enough to survive the bright lights. But it wasn't an overnight change, it was one that happened in stages, led by the example of the hottest companies of each generation. Public enemy 'Hacking' is more than just coding in the startup world. Hacking is a way of life. You hack your mental energy \u2014 apparently \u2014 by putting grass-fed butter in your coffee. You hack getting fat while programming all day by getting a treadmill desk. You hack dating with a mobile app or retirement planning with a robotic investment advisor. Naturally, in the wake of the crash, everyone wanted to hack the IPO. The industry wanted to find a new way to reward VCs and investors for taking all that risk, without punishing their companies by casting them out on their own too early. Acquisitions weren't the answer because (until lately) the price tags weren't big enough. More startups exit today by acquisition than IPO, but some 95% of the returns[1] for the industry still come from the massive, massive home runs generated by about 5% of the deals, and these are almost always IPOs (WhatsApp notwithstanding). As the venture industry has swollen in size, those home runs need to be massive to keep everyone paid and provide the lifeblood essential to starting the next generation of companies. Acquisitions typically don't do that. Also, many entrepreneurs want to build something that will last. Very few acquired companies do well with new overlords. The hack came in via a combination of secondary markets \u2014 which allow select early investors,\u00a0founders. and employees to cash out well before an IPO \u2014 and a insane multi-billion dollar swell in late stage private investment activity. This capital is coming from the kind of investors who \u2014 in another era \u2014 would be buying shares at the IPO. Facebook was really the company that first hacked this process \u2014 a move I've previously described[2] as the Web 2.0 era's equivalent of 'The Netscape Moment.' <br/>Like a lot of people in the Valley, I thought this was mostly a positive development. After all, it means founders are able to sell shares earlier, aligning their interest with more diversified investors so that everyone wants to 'go long' together. Big sustainable companies investing in making our lives better, creating wealth, and jobs are all good things, right? A long term focus is always better than a short term focus. An obsession with short term is, after all, why industries like newspapers and the recording industry and Detroit Auto are flailing now. They all saw the future but couldn't really act on it. <br/>I also \u2014 naively \u2014 thought companies in the hands of professional (private) investors would yield better results in terms of products and growth than companies in the hands of the activist hedge funds, short-term oriented traders, and skittish ma and pa mainstreets that make up the majority of public market investors. <br/>This is where I -\u00a0along with many, many others -\u00a0was wrong. Completely wrong. I never thought I'd write these words: Sometimes the public markets is the best thing that can happen to a hot company. <br/>How it all went too far The move to hack the IPO has happened in three acts, which can be traced to three seminal companies: Google, Facebook, and Uber. Each was the company of its era in the Valley, so despite being outliers, as the most visible home runs, they set the tone. Coming out of an era where companies were going public in 18 months or less, Google pushed the IPO off until it was a strong enough company to control its own destiny. It took a lot of the power out of the hands bankers by insisting on a dutch auction and it was one of the first big tech companies to have dual stock structures meant to insulate management from outside threats. Then Facebook pushed the envelope further, but not only implementing a dual stock structure, but by also allowing a lot of people to exit before the IPO \u2014 hoping the IPO would be less of a singular defining liquidity event. (That didn't totally work.) Today, Uber running a different playbook than even Facebook. First, it has controlled access to liquidity much more than Facebook ever did. But, by contrast, the company's access to capital has been an exaggeration of Facebook's already prodigious fundraising path. Uber has wholly embraced the notion of raising gargantuan amounts of money at jaw-dropping late stage valuations as an avenue to put off an IPO, seemingly indefinitely if it wants. That should suit a CEO like Uber's Travis Kalanick who bristles at anyone telling him how to do his job and hates government regulation. Importantly, Uber is the first unicorn of the mobile-first era. It led the wave of expanding the consumer Web into the real world, and with it drummed up totally new and lucrative business models. It's a company that has gotten big fast, and despite operating in a highly regulated part of the world, it's done so with little oversight. Enough is enough Watching the various scandals of Uber unfold this week[3] I was struck by two things. The first is that there is seemingly no line the company's executives can cross that will make the board or investors act. The second is related: It's the first time I've ever felt like a private venture-backed company's product and customers\u00a0would be better off if that were publicly traded. Imagine the last week if Uber were publicly traded. Imagine Wall Street's reaction to reports that it's 'god viewing[4]' journalists data and proposing $1 million campaigns to target their families with 'oppo research' splashed on every network, the front page of the biggest three newspapers, and even the butt of late night talk shows[5]. Public investors have sold off at far less. The public markets may be driven by emotion and fear, but it's a market that is also highly efficient at holding companies accountable for bad behavior and\u00a0forcing\u00a0change when needed. The public and the press have spoken, with the clear message from the majority being that as a society we don't think this behavior is OK. But Uber's investors have exerted no pressure on the Valley darling. Instead, they're sitting around, waiting out the news cycle or, in the case of Ashton Kutcher, actually joining in the smears[6]. Finally, two days into the farce where we were expected to believe Emil Michael's comments at a private party didn't reflect his actual beliefs, and worse expected to believe that Uber as a company didn't support those views even though it refused to fire him, there was only one force that could act: The government. Washington\u00a0comes to Silicon Valley Enter Senator Al Franken's letter to Travis Kalanick[7]. This is the second \u2014 and far more dramatic \u2014 time we've seen something like this in the venture world the last few weeks. When The Guardian reported[8] concerns over Whisper's use of consumer data, the executive seemingly responsible, Neetzan Zimmerman, was initially not removed from his job either. Again, the investors seemed to be nowhere to be found. And so we got a letter[9] from a senator: Senator Jay Rockefeller\u00a0in this case. Thanks to changes in how companies are funded and the free flow of capital across the venture ecosystem, founders in Silicon Valley exert more control than ever before. Also, truly huge consumer hits are so rare that once in, investors are terrified at pissing the founders off and locking themselves out of more ownership, or torpedoing their golden goose by speaking out against its bad behavior. Again: More founder control should be a good thing. But left totally unchecked and you wind up with\u2026 Uber. As Joe Nocera from the New York Times wrote[10] this weekend, 'At Uber, the inmates are running the asylum. That needs to change, while there's still time.' The message from Senators Franken and Rockefeller is equally clear: If Silicon Valley VCs refuse to keep the behavior of their portfolio companies\u00a0in check, the government will. For companies, this is very bad news because the government doesn't remotely understand technology or business. You thought the SEC was a pain in the ass? Now the regulations aren't only interested\u00a0in financials, but at\u00a0companies' uses of customer data - something that directly affects product road maps and the ability to monetize all those precious eyeballs. I find myself in a position I never thought I'd be in watching this week's events unfold: I'm actually glad to see the government taking a closer look at Silicon Valley. Reckless disregard for customers \u2014 even when customers are now uninstalling Uber in droves \u2014 has left senators little choice. Someone has to act in public interest when these technology companies are controlling highly sensitive information - in this case, information pertaining to our movements around a city that directly impacts the safety of everyone getting in these cars. Travis Shrugged That Uber might end up being the company that brought Washington regulars to Silicon Valley is richly ironic, given\u00a0Uber is known as the poster child[11] of the libertarian disruption movement. You won't hear me say this often this week, but I don't entirely blame Travis Kalanick for what's going to happen next. I blame Uber's\u00a0investors and its\u00a0board. They are supposed to be the arms length reality check on an impassioned, semi-crazy founder. They are supposed to be the ones with all the pattern recognition to warn for unintended consequences. And they are the ones who should be long-term greedy not short-term terrified of missing out on the next round. Uber's investors failed the company this week. They failed their LPs whose money they invest. And they failed this industry, which is fighting to outgrow its reputation as a place where immaturity and machismo more rule than exception. For once, Silicon Valley should be thankful to see the government intervene. It may be the only thing that keeps this whole train from barreling off the tracks.

That's it, you show us how it should be done. A strong gavel bringing trading to a close. It is Tuesday, the 9th of August.

Manchester United breaks a world record to resign Pogba. I'm Richard Quest, tonight from Washington D.C., where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>new economic plan has received its highest profile backing so far. In his first tweet about the U.S. presidential election in more than a year, the billionaire activist/<person><nameText>investor Carl Icahn </nameText></person>is hailing Mr. Trump's speech as great. He then went on to praise Trump's temperament for persevering as protesters interrupted throughout Monday' event. And <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>asked his twitter followers, the following question, \"How many of our presidents, even our great presidents, would have handled the antics that went on in that auditorium as well as he did?\"</p><p>Now Trump's relationship with <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>is one of mutual respect and admiration between the two billionaires. <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>has consistently praised Mr. Trump's promises to renegotiate trade deals. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>sees <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>as an insider ready to help overhaul the economy. Even at one point suggesting that he could serve as his treasury secretary. At a campaign rally in June, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said he wanted Icahn to take a lead role in renegotiating America's trade deals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm all for free trade. It's fine. But I want <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>negotiating for me. I want the greatest business people negotiating my deals, not hacks, OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: <person><nameText>Carl Icahn </nameText></person>joins me now on the line. Mr. Icahn, thank you, sir, we're glad and grateful you have joined us this evening. Let's begin. You described the speech as great. And obviously you put <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>as potentially one of the great presidents if he's elected. What is it about Mr. Trump that you find so appealing?</p><p><person><nameText>CARL ICAHN, </nameText></person><person><nameText>ICAHN ENTERPRISES </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>SUPPORTER (via telephone): Yes, well, I would just like to clarify. I said the way he handled the problems, the disruptions, I thought he did it in a very cool way. But as far as I'm concerned, the economic system today is very flawed. And I think we have a great problem in our economy. I've been saying that for, you know, a year or two. You can't have a government at war with business. You can't have a government at war with business. And this is what we have today in our country.</p><p>I think Donald spoke to that in his speech at some great length. I think one of our major problems in this country is the fact that you have a regulatory agency sort of running amok. Now, there are good people in them. There's got to be regulation. There's got to be a system. But I'm going to be speaking about that in the future myself. You don't have capital spending. I mean, spending for machinery, spending for factories. We don't have that today. And we are at an all-time low as far as productivity goes. We don't really manufacture products anymore.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>ICAHN: As far as I'm concerned, I think this economy can go -- basically could go over the precipice.</p><p>QUEST: Now, let me jump in there, if I may, sir. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has also criticized business in his own right. He criticized Ford for sending jobs, what he said was to Mexico. He talked about Apple building their phones overseas.</p><p>[16:05:00] He's blasted hedge funds and Wall Street in many ways, the establishment, if you like. And so how do you balance that, if you like, with the criticism that you say of the Obama administration against business? <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has also been highly critical.</p><p>ICAHN: I don't think he's -- let's start with -- there's a difference in what you're talking about. In his trade policies, I haven't studied them greatly. I'm no expert on trade. That I leave to Donald and his economic advisers. As far as the fact that we don't have jobs, he claims, he says, and I think there's a lot of truth in it, because of very bad trade policies and trade agreements. But the area that I'm focusing on more, which I think is really abominable, is the fact that we really are, as a country, as a business, as people that own businesses -- America is really made of business, we're a capitalistic society.</p><p>I think that today business is afraid of government. They're afraid of what government is going to do. I don't think there's much argument about that. I could show you examples of when the EPA actually puts businesses out of business. And that's true of the NLRB, that's true of the FDC to some extent. Now, they're not bad people. But the mandate they have is basically in many ways to putting regulations that keep businesses from spending capital. Hey look, if you're the CEO of a company today, and you know and I speak against a lot of CEOs, I've been very critical of many of them, as you know.</p><p>QUEST: Absolutely.</p><p>ICAHN: But in this case, I have to agree with them. Even a mediocre CEO today. He looks at it and says, hey look, on the one hand, I have money, I can put in new machinery. And now I look when I put in new machinery and I've got an EPA that doesn't like me and is going to regulate the hell out of me and I'm not going to make money out of that investment. I can borrow money at zero interest rates, thanks to the Fed. Or I could buy the stock back. So all this money is being funneled so you think that the stimulation from the Fed would build capital in this country and give jobs to many of our middle class workers that really don't have good jobs. I don't think we can argue that.</p><p>QUEST: If I can jump in there, just to -- on this point that you raise, are you worried, though, as you put forward this pro-business argument for <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>that many in the Republican Party are actually running away from him at the moment, almost disowning him as he puts forward these proposals.</p><p>ICAHN: No, I don't really agree with that. I think he's had a very bad week, I'm not going to debate that. In other words, they don't like some things, some of the attacks he does. I think that's how he sort of won the primary. I personally would say that, hey, people who make mistakes, I think he went overboard last week. And I think a lot of Republicans don't like that. And it maybe hurts their chance to get in the Senate. But I think that can be rectified. But they're not saying -- they agree that we have -- look almost all Republicans agree, government has got way too big in this country.</p><p>And not only too big, but it's actually frightened corporate America. I think it's very simplistic. If you're frightened, if a country is frightened, they're not going to invest capital, which is what's going on. Capital spending is lower, has just gone down, which is unheard of when you're not in a recession, and our productivity is at its slowest point, growth and productivity in the third quarter we just had.</p><p>QUEST: Let me ask you, finally, sir, and we are grateful for this, would you, are you, have you thought about in any shape or form, if president Trump is elected, that you would play a role in the administration? I know early on there was talk of treasury secretary. What role would you like to have?</p><p>ICAHN: Unequivocally I will not, except maybe in the kitchen cabinet somewhere, you know, like Jackson had. In other words, there is no way. You know, I have ten businesses, 15 businesses that I run. I like doing what I do. I've been successful at it. But I do think if Trump doesn't win, and you get more of the same that you've had for the last eight years, we have a major problem in our economy. We do already, because we don't have jobs for the middle class, good jobs. And if you don't have productivity, you know, we're not Rome. If you look at Rome, they had hegemony for 800 years, but it was vastly different.</p><p>[16:10:0] The plebeians didn't have to work, because they had a great army and the army would go conquer other countries and bring in goods for nothing.</p><p>In this country we don't do that. So therefore, our hegemony will fall by its wayside if we don't produce goods. You can't keep just texting to each other. You say well great, we're a service economy. Isn't that wonderful, and for a while that works. Everybody is walking around the street texting. If you go on and on, you get to its conclusion you get more and more texting. That doesn't make an economy. And that is going to cost us dearly in the future.</p><p>QUEST: <person><nameText>Carl Icahn, </nameText></person>thank you, sir, for joining us on the line, I appreciate it, thank you. Your forthright views, always good to hear from you. We've obviously been digesting what Mr. Icahn said, particularly on the question that he says, quite unequivocally, that he has no ambitions to be in the cabinet. The kitchen cabinet is what he describes himself as perhaps being interested in, as he runs those. But a clear unequivocal support for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>on the business question of getting regulation off the back of businesses.</p><p>On the campaign trail itself, a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>joke about <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>views on gun control is attracting controversy. Sara Murray is in Fayetteville in North Carolina, where there's going to be a rally later this evening. Sara Murray, what was said and what was meant and are people taking it out of proportion?</p><p>SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: Well, that is exactly what people are parsing right now. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>made a comment about second amendment supporters and about <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>Supreme Court Justices. People are reading it very different ways. But it certainly raised eyebrows among those in the room and those on twitter. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the second amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick -- if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know. But I'll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MURRAY: Now, the Clinton campaign quickly seized on this. They took it as a sign that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was looking to incite violence. Clinton's campaign manager put out a statement saying what Trump is saying is dangerous. Now the Trump campaign also quickly moved to clarify this comment and they're spinning it in a different way, saying that what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>meant is second amendment supporters are going to rally behind him and vote for him in November. In their statement they said, it's called the power of unification, second amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year they will be voting in record numbers and it won't be for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>It will be for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>But Richard, this was the week when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was trying to stick to the script. We have a number of Republicans saying they won't back him or are cautious about backing him. And it's offhand comments like these that have caused political fire storms for him in the past.</p><p>QUEST: At the end of the day do we put today's comments down to just one of those things, a here today gone tomorrow campaign foible?</p><p>MURRAY: it's always very difficult to tell with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Richard, because as you know, he says a lot of things in the course of the day, on television, at his campaign events, and on twitter. I do think that the one thing that is notable is how fast the Trump campaign responded in trying to clarify what he meant, saying we were just talking about people voting for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>over <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>This is a big change from the campaign we were dealing with a couple of months ago or even a couple of weeks ago that might have let a comment linger out there for weeks or days without any kind of explanation.</p><p>QUEST: Sara Murray in Fayetteville, North Carolina. If you get the Fayetteville right in terms of pronunciations, you'll be all right.</p><p>The U.S. markets closed slightly higher on Tuesday. The NASDAQ is at a record high. Paul La Monica is at the New York Stock Exchange. All the markets remain extremely ebullient, although, the NASDAQ particularly. So what's driving the NASDAQ more than others?</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you have big tech stocks that continue to rally. Optimism about their earnings, companies like Google and Amazon that both hit all-time highs today, Richard. Even though there is a lot of skepticism about the health of the consumer, Google and Amazon are two companies that continue to do extremely well.</p><p>QUEST: The Dow starts -- I won't say it was rip roaring. It was up the best part of 50. The gains evaporated and we eked out a small gain. So the concern there was what?</p><p>LA MONICA: I don't know if there was a real tangible news event that whipped the market around today. Because when you look at it, at the end of the day, we were in a very tight range.</p><p>[16:15:00] This is the summer. Volume is a bit lower. But what's interesting is that there are some concerns about the health of the American consumer. Retail stocks really took it on the chin today, Gap in particular, really bad results once again. And you have to wonder now, are American consumers pulling back? Or are they just not spending at these traditional mall-based retailers because they're doing everything on Amazon?</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, thank you.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: China has warned the United Kingdom the relations will suffer if the British government goes ahead and drops plans for $23 billion nuclear power plant. The new British Prime Minister, <person><nameText>Theresa May, </nameText></person>has announced a review of the Hinkley Point C Station, which is a joint project between the British, the French, and the Chinese. The Chinese are China has warned the United Kingdom their relations will suffer if the British government goes ahead and drops plan for a $23 billion nuclear power plant. The new British Prime Minister, <person><nameText>Theresa May, </nameText></person>has announced a review of the Hinkley Point C Station providing a third of the capital. China announced its stake in the British project late last year. Then David Cameron pledged a golden era of relations between the two countries.</p><p>Now the Chinese ambassador has written to the \"Financial Times\" and said, \"Right now the China/U.K. relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more.\" Patrick Chovanec, is the chief strategist at Silver Crest Asset Management, as well as a professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. Many wondered why the British Prime Minister would be picking a fight with the Chinese particularly when the British will be going for a better trade agreement in a post-Brexit area. And now, the Chinese seem to be basically saying, watch out, you need us more than we need you.</p><p>PATRICK CHOVANEC, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SILVER CREST ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's interesting that the Chinese are playing hardball in this way. They are playing hardball with a lot of different people. Clearly they feel they have leverage. And yes, at this point, with the Brexit vote, the British have raised the idea of a free trade agreement with China. They clearly do have leverage. But I also think that it makes sense for the British to take a little bit more skeptical view of Chinese investment. Not to say that they should have a negative view. But I think it's entirely reasonable for them to review the security issues that are involved with this kind of investment.</p><p>QUEST: It was a surprise, though, but bearing in mind, the Chinese had already sent the delegation to London for the signing ceremony. The fact that <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>made the decision to have a review whilst reasonable, if she decides against Hinckley and the Chinese investment, then that's going to be very difficult to repair the damage.</p><p>CHOVANEC: Well, there are a lot of things you can do to upset the Chinese. This is one deal among many. The Cameron cabinet lived in fear of offending the Chinese. And I think that they were, on the other extreme, that Osbourne in many ways was like a fan boy sometimes towards China, and they were so reluctant to engage in even completely justified criticism of China, because they wanted to court good Chinese opinion.</p><p>So I think that a little bit of a movement towards a review of these kinds of issues, look, I know from talking to people who are in a position to know in Britain that they have discovered things like back doors and software of critical infrastructure. So it's reasonable to not reject these kind of investments out of hand, because these kind of investments, it's a global economy, China is a partner in that global economy, but to take the time to actually review it makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p>QUEST: Patrick Chovanec, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CHOVANEC: Good to be with you.</p><p>QUEST: When we continue, a sporting record that's got nothing to do with the Olympics. Pogba is returning to Manchester United. The deals are ready drawing criticism because of the huge amounts of money involved. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we're in Washington, DC.</p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Now he left Manchester United for just under $2 million four years ago. Now he's returning for a record-breaking contract, more than 50 times that sum. Paul Pogba, there he is. After weeks of back and forth, the 23- year-old French super star will leave Aventis and be a Red Devil once again. Pogba will wear number 6 for United. Make a note of these numbers please, because they're quite breathtaking. $116 million is his contract. It breaks the world record that was set by Gareth Bale in 2013, $116 million. Now bear in mind, he went for $2 million a couple of years ago.</p><p>The deal is being criticized for its high price. It amounts to $4 million for every league goal he's ever scored. And as some English club owners feared, it would happen in the post-Brexit world. United's pain a 12 percent premium, because the deal was done in euros and the value of sterling has plummeted.</p><p>From London is the football agent Sky Andrew. Sky Andrew, $2 million four years ago or whatever it is, $116 million in 2016. Can anything justify these sorts of sums of money?</p><p>SKY ANDREW, FOOTBALL AGENT: A player is only worth what someone is prepared to pay. We're in an era where premier clubs have the most money they've ever had, 5.14 billion in rights money. So the timing was good for Pogba. Many wanted him.</p><p>He was sold too cheaply or they paid too much. Has Pogba improved that much since they let him go?</p><p>It isn't a matter of how much Pogba has improved. It's about supply and demand. There are so many players in the world that are not as good as him. There is a massive demand for players like Pogba. And there's very little supply. So when a player like him is available, clubs all around the world are going to battle for his signature. What Manchester united have proved is even though they're not in the champions league, they've got one of the most sought-after players in the world. What it shows is that Marino, Pogba, Man United wanted to put themselves back on the map. They wanted to show people that they mean business. And newsflash, Man United are back.</p><p>QUEST: He was either sold too cheaply or they paid too much. Has Pogba improve that much since they let him go?</p><p>ANDREW: Well, it isn't a matter of how much Pogba has improved, it's about supply and demand. You know, there are so many players in the world that are not as good as him. You know there is a massive supply for players like Pogba. Sorry, there is a massive demand for players like Pogba, and there's very little supply. So when a player like him is available, clubs all around the world are going to battle for his signature. And what Manchester United have proved is that even though they are not in the champions league, they have got one of the most sought after players in the world. So what it shows is that Mourinho, Slattern, Pogba, Man United are back.</p><p>QUEST: OK, now give us an idea. So the agent gets what, 10 percent of the transfer fee as the agent's commission?</p><p>ANDREW: Well, normally an agent would get a percentage of the player's salary, 5 or 10 percent. In this case, from the numbers being thrown about, it seems that what's happened is that the agent has obviously represented his club in Italy and done a deal and said, look, I can get you X from Manchester United. That's the only way an agent can get the reported sums. But the agent's done their job. Whether the public like it or not, he's going to be rewarded handsomely in a business that's making billions of pounds.</p><p>QUEST: Sky, you are absolutely right to chastise me in this way. We are a business program.</p><p>ANDREW: I'm not chastising you.</p><p>QUEST: No, no, you're right, we are a business program. And we can hardly live and breathe by the law of supply and demand and then when it comes to football, suddenly say that seems a great deal of money. As you rightly say, Sky, if that's all the market will bear.</p><p>ANDREW: I mean, that's the amazing thing about football. Is that when people look into this game, they think that certain rules shouldn't apply.</p><p>[16:25:04] When you've got a player like that, and everybody wanted him, including reportedly, Real Madrid. For Manchester United to actually go in there and get this player, they know they have to pay a king's ransom. Under normal circumstances maybe they wouldn't have had to pay that much. But Manchester United want to make a mark. They're one of the biggest clubs in the world. By getting this player, what they're showing everybody is I mean business, and they've got the signature.</p><p>QUEST: And we thank you for coming on and talking about the business.</p><p>ANDREW: No problem.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, sir. From the pitch at Old Trafford, and into the pool in Rio. <person><nameText>Michael Phelps </nameText></person>will swim to regain glory on Tuesday night in the 200-meter butterfly final. It's his signature race. Phelps has made it clear, he's not going just for gold. He fell short at the London games in '12, and the 2014 drunk driving incident saw his sponsorship opportunities sort of shrivel up. Now winning tonight represents the pinnacle of a comeback story and obviously, Phelps into retirement primed for many lucrative deals. Don Riddell is in Rio. In terms, Don, of the rehabilitation if such there need to be for Phelps, the real truth is, carrying the American flag, the stars and stripes, that was the final seal of approval. Perhaps more so in many ways than the 20th or 21st gold that he'll pick up in the next couple of days.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yes, I think that's a good point. There are I guess many different images to <person><nameText>Michael Phelps. </nameText></person>It depends where you are in the world as to what image you look at. Of course corporate sponsors will look perhaps for the bad stuff, where is sports fans will look for the positives. There is no doubt <person><nameText>Michael Phelps </nameText></person>is the greatest Olympian of all time. I agree with you. I think carrying the flag was a huge statement. Being captain of the swim team. He's a father as well. Clearly he seems to have gotten things back on track since that blip a couple of years ago.</p><p>But it is interesting, and you were talking with Sky Andrews there about the amounts of money that can be available to you in the world of sport. I think it is important to <person><nameText>Michael Phelps </nameText></person>that he wins gold medals in individual events to remind everybody here that that's what he's all about. Because he was the star of the Beijing games, no question, eight gold medals. You say Bolt is the star of those games as well with three. But when they both came to London, Bolt remained the star with three golds, Phelps kind of didn't really want to be there. He wasn't as good. But this is his chance to really kick it up a notch again, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: The interviews I've seen with Phelps since he's been in Rio, suggest he's a thoroughly nice person.</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, and I tell you, we're also seeing another side to <person><nameText>Michael Phelps, </nameText></person>because we've got this other story bubbling up here, which I know you are very well aware of, how athletes feel about doping, cheats. Whether they're Russian or not. <person><nameText>Michael Phelps </nameText></person>came out of his press conference the other day and acknowledged the situation. He said, I don't think I've ever swum in a clean Olympics. He's also stood by Lilly King who took a big stand against Yulia Efimova. Phelps again coming out and saying, you know what, athletes should speak out. They should do more. And so I think that is also a sign that he is kind of assumed this kind of more senior status within his sport and is more responsible and is prepared to speak out. Because a lot of athletes, younger in their career, aren't as confident about that. I would say Lilly King is one of the exceptions. So taking more of a leadership role there from Phelps.</p><p>QUEST: I saw you on \"WORLD SPORT\" the other night, getting to grips with this cupping syndrome that they're all having a go about it. You've obviously -- I tried it once for a bit of back pain once, I can honestly say it didn't seem to do absolutely anything. My back still twinged as much as ever. Are you a fan of it yet?</p><p>RIDDELL: I don't know. I don't think I really got the proper cup. I think I had one of those portable ones that kind of popped off as soon as it was on. I mean, if I was injured, Richard, I would try anything. I've not got the best back in the world myself. If that was to deteriorate further, I might look into it. I do know people myself who absolutely swear by it. The state of their backs afterwards, it looks like someone's taken a garden rake to it.</p><p>QUEST: I know the problem I tell you. I've tried acupuncture, cupping. Thanks a lot, Don.

Some say it's all because the Turkish economy has been backed into a corner. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in Washington, DC.

It's the first time they've been together since Turkey shot down a Russian warplane late last year and follows the failed coup in Turkey last month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>VLADIMIR PUTIN, </nameText></person>RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It's understandable that this meeting has a very significant importance for the fate of the Russian and Turkish relationship. We had a constructive talk about issues on our list for our relationship as well as other issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: In Afghanistan, 14 people have been wounded after a suicide bomber blew himself up at a busy market.

The leaders of both nations, as you heard in the news, have pledged stronger and more resilient economic ties. It all follows nine months after Turkey shot down a Russian jet. And that led to relations being put on ice. For Turkey, it was throe born out of necessity. The Russian sanctions, obviously, combined with the recent terror attacks, brought a huge blow to the Turkish economy.</p><p>After all, look at the numbers. Russia is Turkey's second biggest tourism market. And the travel ban caused tourism from Russia to drop by 90 percent. It was reversed after Turkey apologized for bringing down the plane. Russia has imposed a ban on Turkish agricultural products. Russian employers are prohibited from hiring Turkish citizens. Russia's involved in building Turkey's first nuclear plant and planning the natural gas pipeline in Turkey. All of this put together, and you end up why the Turkish lira is under pressure.</p><p>The coup attempt that hit investor confidence hard, it was already down after Russia imposed sanctions. Put it all together. The relations between Turkey and Russia and this warming up, it all happens at the same time that Turkey's relationships with the West are decidedly cool. CNN's Matthew Chance is in St. Petersburg, where he sent this dispatch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Is the Turkish president turning to Russia and away from the west? This highly symbolic meeting in St. Petersburg has raised concerns. As were the warm words of this key NATO ally to his Kremlin counterpart. He called Putin his dear friend.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT, TURKEY (through translator): The relations between Russia and Turkey have entered into a really positive phase. We are both familiar with the process of setting up great goals. I am sure that steps we both take will widen our corporation.</p><p>CHANCE: This was the moment that cooperation dramatically narrowed, when Turkish interceptors shot down a Russian warplane near the Turkish Syrian border last November. As it plunged in a fireball, relations between Russia and Ankara also crashed in flames. Russia's infuriated president could barely contain his anger. He called it a stab in the back. But now, after expressions of regret from Erdogan, Putin's mode appears to have changes. Talk now, is a fully restoring Russian and Turkish ties.</p><p>PUTIN: Despite a very complicated internal political situation in Turkey, your visit today means that we all want a renewal of our dialogue and restoration of our relations in the interest of Russian and Turkish peoples.</p><p>CHANCE: After eight months of trade sanctions and bitterness, it's a diplomatic back flip almost worthy of the Olympics themselves.</p><p>CHANCE (on camera): This meeting here in St. Petersburg is meant to cement the rekindling of a Russia/Turkey relationship so badly damaged over Syria. Economic necessity on both sides is almost certainly the driving force. But it's the timing of the visit, the first by President Erdogan, after a failed military coup last month that's given the meeting extra significance.</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over): Amid a Turkish crackdown on opponents, more than 18,000 have been detained. Relations between Turkey and the West are strained. And the Kremlin senses an opportunity. Putin was quick to remind his Turkish counterpart of his early backing.</p><p>PUTIN: I know that I was one of the first who called on the phone and expressed my support in overcoming the internal political crisis after the coup d'etat. I would like to say again it is our principled position that we will always categorically be against any unconstitutional deeds.</p><p>CHANCE: Amid Turkish anger at western criticism, Putin's hand of friendship may count for a lot. Matthew Chance, CNN, St. Petersburg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>As we continue tonight, the Florida governor has announced four new Zika cases in his state. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>visiting Florida, says that Congress should return to deal with the crisis. In a moment.</p><p>[16:41:31] QUEST: The murky matters at Fox News and 21st Century Fox just keep coming. Now several Fox News personalities and producers have told CNN they long feared that Roger Ailes had tapped their phones to monitor conversations. There's no concrete evidence of this. It's all a rather rum business. Brian Stelter is with me from New York. Brian, your firsthand reporting of talking to Fox sources, reporters or producers, tell us the story.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN MONEY SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Fox sources are hard to come by normally. When Roger Ailes was running Fox, people were wary of talking to the press, and one of the reasons why was because of these widespread rumors and belief that the place was bugged, that phones were tapped. That Fox and Ailes would know if you leaked. Now that Ailes has resigned, we're starting to hear more about what it was like inside Fox when he was running the network for 20 years. This is a man who really had a fiefdom. It was all to himself. The Murdochs were barely involved. Ailes, for better or worse, ran it almost all by himself. And so we're hearing about the tactics and the strategies behind it, which were sometimes downright paranoid, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But you obviously covered 21st century and Fox News not only for CNN but obviously in your previous existence at \"The New York Times.\" is this something that you had noticed over many years, that there was an element of those people who work at Fox didn't want to be on the record, didn't want to be seen talking to you, or whatever?</p><p>STELTER: I would say we had suspicions. We had reasons to think things worked differently at Fox News. We knew, for example, that Fox's PR department kept dossiers about reporters. They would rather things I had said five or ten years ago and use those comments against me. That kind of behavior we knew about. What we didn't know was that Ailes was employing private investigators to tail, to follow journalists.</p><p>Let me give you another example. We always knew that Ailes was a paranoid guy. That he was politically incorrect. That he would say foul mouthed things. What we didn't know was dozens of women inside Fox said they had been sexually harassed by him. So in other words, we sort of had a sense vaguely of his behavior, but now were finding out a lot more. And that's why according to \"Vanity Fair,\" Ailes and Fox are now in settlement talks with Gretchen Carlson. The anchor who originally sued him for sexual harassment. Seems to me that 21st century Fox wants this to go away and a settlement could be one way to do that.</p><p>QUEST: As I read your reporting earlier, merely disposing of Roger Ailes with some of the allegations, does not deal with the underlying questions of whether his number two knew about it, or the man, perhaps some say, was going to take over from Fox when Rupert Murdoch finally does relinquish the day-to-day control.</p><p>STELTER: That's absolutely right. The internal favorite, Bill Schein, he's the head of programming, which means he oversees shows like \"Bill O'Reilly,\" \"Megyn Kelly,\" and \"Sean Hannity.\" He has been implicated in some of these new reports this week about alleged harassment. Schein has denied knowledge of the harassment, but his name keeps coming up. So there's widespread speculation about whether other heads are going to roll or there's going to be a broader housecleaning or not. This is the kind of pressure the Murdochs are now under as people in the TV industry, the tightknit TV industry, ask whether other people are going to be affected. Right now the answer is no. But will see.</p><p>[16:45:04] QUEST: Now, look, Brain. You know, at the end of the day, this industry leaks like a sieve. You know this. You have firsthand knowledge of dating people.</p><p>STELTER: This is a little embarrassing. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Go on. You're amongst friends.</p><p>STELTER: Well, just you and me, Richard. Ten years ago I had a blog, called, \" TVNewser.\" It was kind of a must-read in the TV news business. People like Roger Ailes had to read the \"TVNewser.\" So what happened to me when I was reading this blog, I had a crush on a low level staffer at Fox News. Low level staffer, didn't think that this was anything more. So we would go out on what I thought were dates. Turned out these were not dates, Richard. These were intelligence gathering situations. She would report back to Ailes and to the head of PR what I would say, what I was thinking about Fox and CNN and MSNBC. Essentially she was spying on me.</p><p>I bring that up only because it's example of the hardball tactics, the highly unusual behaviors that Fox was known for. I didn't know this entailed having private investigators following other journalists. What we're finding out now is, essentially we saw the iceberg and now for the first time, we're finding out what was underneath the surface of the water. And what was going on underneath the water was much more disturbing than what we knew about years ago.</p><p>QUEST: I could arguably say you should be more careful in the company with which you consort, Mr. Stelter.</p><p>STELTER: I've learned the hard way, haven't I?</p><p>QUEST: Indeed. We'll talk more about it when I'm back in New York tomorrow.</p><p>STELTER: All right, thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Your first class reporting. And don't forget, remind us, Brian, where do we sign up for your newsletter, Brian?</p><p>STELTER: CNNmoney.com/media. I'll send it out in a few years.</p><p>QUEST: CNNmoney.com/media for reliable sources from Brian Stelter.</p><p>A short time ago four new cases of the Zika virus have been reported in Florida, on top of 322 previously reported cases. During a visit to the area and to the state, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>has called on the Congress to return to Washington from summer break and pass legislation to fight the Zika virus. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>toured a health center in Miami on Tuesday, which is the epicenter of the virus in the U.S. and she said Zika is too urgent a crisis to wait for Congress to come back from vacation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON, </nameText></person>U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really am hoping that they will pay attention. In fact, I would very much urge the leadership of Congress to call people back for a special session and get a bill passed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joe Johns is with me in Washington. No chance of a special election, not in an election year, I'm guessing, Joe.</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Not at all. She's touring South Florida. Which, yes, it's on the front lines of the Zika battle. Even the campaign says the true epicenter of the problem in the United States is Puerto Rico. Texas now reporting the first Zika-related death. But the odds of congress coming back to deal with this problem based on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>urging are at near zero. It is, Richard, a way for her to show that she's taking on the Republicans in Congress and acting like a leader.</p><p>The fact is that congress is on a long summer break. They will be back in September. And they have not been able to pass a bill and send it to the president for a signature. Disagreement over how much money is going to spent and where the money will come from. The White House has asked for almost 2 billion. The Senate has come up with a different number and the House has come up with a different number than that, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, good lord. But the fact that she's in Florida, I'm imagining we would expect to see <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>spend a great deal more time there.</p><p>JOHNS: Absolutely. And just underscoring how important Florida is, that is the place where she unveiled her running mate. And she was there yesterday. She's going to spend so much time because it's a key battleground state. The latest Quinnipiac poll here shows that she's essentially tied with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Though she's doing much better in some of the other battleground states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, tied in Florida with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And that is a state both of them could use in November.</p><p>QUEST: Joe Johns in DC, thank you, sir.</p><p>Our newsletter tonight is just about to be published at CNNmoney.com/quest, where you can subscribe.

And some hotel owners and homeowners are already winners. Highlights from \"MAKE, CREATE, INNOVATE\" our first</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: it is impressive even if not a podium finish at the Olympics. Airbnb is now worth $30 billion making it the world's fourth most valuable private company. It has an IPO yet. The home sharing group raised $850 million from investors. That's how you would work out what it would be in a full float. In Rio it's an official Olympic sponsor. And of course, as it does around the world, competes against traditional hotels. Brazilian homeowners are cashing in like rarely seen before. Shasta Darlington has our report from Rio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the place to be in Rio de Janeiro if you want to spend at least $500 a night. If you don't, head away from the beaches to Lara's house, one of Airbnb's 40,000 listings in the city. Fresh fruit for breakfast, dorm room beds for $30 a night, and for Lada, a full-time job.</p><p>\"I used to sell newspapers,\" she says. I had a car accident, and while I was recovering I started searching the web and got a message that said, want to be my host?\"</p><p>Her house now fully booked during the summer games. Many of the guests' Olympic volunteers. \"During the games, prices go way up,\" she says. \"So when a place like this opens its doors, it's great.\" Especially in the middle of a prolonged recession. Airbnb says its hosts will make about $25 million during the Olympics.</p><p>LEO TRISTAO, AIRBNB BRAZIL MANAGER: Listings are spread out across the city. That means we're also spreading out the impact in neighborhoods that are not tourist destinations.</p><p>DARLINGTON: The hill top neighborhood of Santa Teresa may not be close to the Olympic Park, but for those who want to splash out there are some pretty good options like this vintage chic villa.</p><p>Anna Kahn has rented her six-bedroom home for the Olympics to a group from Finland for a total of $15,000. Income that she says helps support her as an artist and single mom while having fun.</p><p>ANNA KAHN, AIRBNB HOST: I'll make some money, nice money. But you know, and then you're going to share and then you're going to party with them, get to know them, get to know lots of people.

Shasta Darlington, CNN, Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Time to look at the markets in the U.S. you'll get a chance to see exactly what sort of choppy sessions we're having at the moment. The Dow rose very slightly. But at the same time the Nasdaq closed at an all-time high. Disney shares are down after hours. The third quarter earnings modestly beat expectations. But Disney, like Time Warner, parent company of this network, is one of the few media companies in the market, therefore a great reflection of what is being thought at the moment of media.</p><p>[16:55:04] We'll have a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. On this show you heard <person><nameText>Carl Icahn, </nameText></person>the international investor, the billionaire, say that <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>economic plan was great. And that the way he was prepared to stand up for business was in direct contradiction to the Obama administration, which has made an entire career, if you like, of bashing business. However, overnight <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>economic plan was roundly criticized by the traditional press over here. Any conservative reading of what people thought believe that although there was the right philosophy of less government, the economic numbers simply didn't add up.</p><p>Whilst it would not lead to such big deficits as the original plan, there was certainly much left to be desired. However, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>economic panel, which only has one Ph.D. amongst it, marches on. It is a pro- business, pro-finance, pro-economy measure that some people say simply doesn't make economic sense. But that of course ignores the fact of who it's appealing to, middle America. And in the middle America of the blue collar worker, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>plan is seen as just the right ticket.</p><p>That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in Washington. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.

clientes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pero tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1n que \"redefinir los modelos de negocio\" y apostar por una \"transformaci\u00f3n gradual del sistema de tecnolog\u00eda de la

Arguably, however, it may be better remembered as a spark plug for an improvement in shareholder democracy and development of new methodologies for selling controversial deals to an increasingly choosey shareholder population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal has been called many things: a civil war in Palo Alto, the last gasp of the Bubble Economy, the triumph of a crass newcomer - H-P CEO Carly Fiorina - over the company's traditional values as embodied by director Walter Hewlett. Hewlett, son of H-P co-founder Bill Hewlett, fought against the merger in a highly charged proxy contest that led to a potentially important court decision in Delaware. Ultimately, the deal closed in May 2002 after enough charges and countercharges to fill the plot line of a soap opera.</p><p>Now that the smoke has cleared from the most expensive proxy battle ever, it's a good time to assess the impact on proxy contests in general and voting battles specifically centering on m&amp;a in a era of heightened shareholder vigilance. In one key phase of the dispute, Delaware Chancellor William B. Chandler rejected Hewlett's complaint alleging that H-P improperly solicited votes from institutional holder Deutsche Bank but inserted a comment in the opinion that he didn't like the way the contacts were handled. Many m&amp;a lawyers held that the unsolicited comment should put companies on guard in talking with institutional shareholders that wore multiple hats, i.e., lender, finance consulting, pension management, etc.</p><p>Merger pros, not surprisingly, had different assessments of the contested deal's impact on subsequent m&amp;a proxy contests.</p><p>\"H-P/Compaq will have a lasting impact on m&amp;a,\" says Patrick McGurn, a Senior Vice President at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a shareholder advisory group. He says that one effect is that any deal will be more highly scrutinized by shareholders.</p><p>H-P outside counsel, Lawrence Sonsini, a partner in the Palo Alto law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati, says that after H-P/Compaq a company has to be prepared to be open and candid during the proxy process. He notes that H-P made 300 separate regulatory filings in the course of the proxy fight.</p><p>Sonsini adds that H-P/Compaq \"raises the bar for getting complex deals sold.\" In the new environment companies have to demonstrate what the cost savings are and what the synergies are, he states.</p><p>McGurn says that a number of deals that were completed in the 1990s would have wilted under the pressures that H-P/Compaq has created. He cites the combination of First Union Corp. and Wachovia Corp., which was opposed by southeastern banking rival SunTrust Banks Inc., as a deal that wouldn't have made it to the finish line had it come out of the gate after the epic H-P/Compaq struggle.</p><p>Proxy expert Richard Grubaugh, a Senior Vice President at D.F. King &amp; Co., says, \"Walter Hewlett's fight gave all large stockholders a precedent for second-guessing management.\"</p><p>And in an indication of the strong feelings generated by last year's corporate battle, one expert on shareholder rights summed up its effect. \"You can't buy votes anymore,\" says Charles Elson, Director of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance.</p><p>H-P did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Another corporate governance expert, Paul Lapides, Director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Kenesaw State University in Georgia, says that the publicity around H-P/ Compaq has drawn increased attention to merger proxy battles from regulators. \"Whether it takes the form of litigation or legislation, I think the government is going to be looking for any trading-votes-for-business conflicts that appear,\" he remarks.</p><p>H-P/Compaq Recap</p><p>H-P's bid for Compaq was launched in the summer of 2001 but Walter Hewlett objected to the proposed merger and launched a proxy battle against it. The election seemed to be decided in March 2002 with a pro-merger margin of victory of 45 million votes. But Hewlett contested the results in the Delaware Chancery Court, based on two complaints. He alleged that H-P had misled shareholders by presenting overly rosy forecasts for the deal. He also claimed that the company twisted arms, most notably of Deutsche Bank's asset management unit, in order to get the German-based bank to put the shares it held behind the deal.</p><p>Neither of these arguments prevailed.</p><p>Chandler ruled in May 2002 that Hewlett hadn't proved either of his contentions but included language that questioned the propriety of a conference call between H-P executives and Deutsche Bank asset management personnel. He says the events raise questions \"about the integrity of the internal ethical wall that purportedly separates\" Deutsche Bank's asset management arm from its investment banking operations.</p><p>The upshot was that people who didn't like the deal in the first place had reason to feel that H-P cheated. For the merger's supporters, H-P had won the vote fair and square.</p><p>But for all the pubic acrimony, proxy expert John Wilcox, a director at proxy solicitation and advice firm Georgeson Shareholder, says that H-P/Compaq was one of the cleanest and most focused battles he has seen. \"This was a fight about business strategy and strategic direction.\" By contrast, he notes, most proxy battles are a fight between people who want to control the assets.</p><p>Going Forward</p><p>Whether or not they believe that Chinese walls were pierced and quid pro quos were employed in H-P's successful campaign to win the proxy vote, dealmakers should be aware of the lessons of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle.</p><p>McGurn says that Walter Hewlett's battle to undo the merger has taken away the stigma from board members voting against management on mergers. \"He (Hewlett) comes out of the fight beaten, but unbowed,\" McGurn states.</p><p>In the wake of Hewlett's battle, dealmakers and their advisers noted a number of changes in how proxy battles in m&amp;a situations will be conducted. But before delving into some of these specific changes, it must be acknowledged that the H-P/Compaq struggle did not occur in a vacuum.</p><p>The crisis at Enron Corp. had surfaced during the proxy battle, but the WorldCom Inc., Tyco International Ltd., Adelphia Communications Corp., Rite-Aid Corp., and other corporate scandals were not yet on the public's radar screen. Since H-P/Compaq closed in May 2002, regulators have imposed a $1.4 billion settlement over analyst conflicts on 10 Wall Street investment firms and Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley governance and disclosure law to restore trust in Corporate America. All of these developments, combined with the lessons from H-P/Compaq, have created the current climate in which dealmakers face higher thresholds of persuasion to sell their deals to management and shareholders.</p><p>Two common denominators among these events are that buying businesses has become frowned on and that Chinese walls have been patched or re-erected. Walter Hewlett's lawsuit protesting the outcome of the proxy battle accused H-P of either causing or profiting from both of these activities. That said, the Delaware court ruled in H-P's favor.</p><p>So while a number of commentators agree that among the results of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle is increased suspicion of management, greater pressure to justify deals, and a higher standard of persuasion needed for any number of strategic moves, they caution that it is not H-P/Compaq alone that has rewritten the rules. But it is one major factor that has influenced a number of the changes and trends in m&amp;a proxy battles going forward.</p><p>A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats</p><p>According to Nell Minow, Editor of The Corporate Library, an investment research firm specializing in corporate governance and board effectiveness, one effect of the H-P/Compaq merger battle is an unprecedented level of support for shareholder resolutions in general. \"H-P/Compaq makes the world safe for directors and shareholders to question strategy. If it had occurred earlier, there might not have been an Enron,\" she says.</p><p>McGurn also connects the increased level of shareholder activism that he says he is seeing this year to the influence of H-P/Compaq. He says that Capital Research &amp; Management Co. executive Gordon Crawford's call for AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steve Case's resignation at the company's shareholders' meeting in August 2002 was partially a result of the changed climate created in part by the H-P/Compaq battle. The atmosphere in which a major institutional shareholder would speak out is a result of H-P/Compaq, he notes. \"You haven't seen mainstream investors go public with their dissatisfactions with management before,\" he adds.</p><p>While H-P set new standards for expense, publicity, and public relations battles in contested mergers, it also had a broader effect in the world of corporate governance.</p><p>Now, issues such as staggered terms, poison pills, and executive pay in addition to change-of-control proposals have become easier to broach, if not win, in the wake of H-P/Compaq.</p><p>Spencer Fleischer, a San Francisco-based investment banker, says that H-P/Compaq has increased pressure for more explicit disclosure of executive compensation. During the proxy battle, Fiorina said that Compaq CEO Michael Capellas would remain with the company as operations chief to make sure that the integration was successful. But his pay arrangements gave him $14.4 million if he left within a year. In November, six months after H-P/Compaq closed, Capellas accepted the chief executive job at MCI Communications Corp., as the re-launched WorldCom is now known.</p><p>Minow says that a development that it is hard to pin directly to H-P/Compaq, but which she believes was strongly affected by the proxy battle, is the action taken by the SEC a few months after the big tech merger.</p><p>The agency issued a proposal in September 2002 that will require mutual funds and other registered management investment companies to disclose their votes in proxy battles.</p><p>\"These proposals would give investors fundamental information about the practices of those who vote proxies on their behalf,\" said then-SEC chairman Harvey Pitt. \"They would also discourage or expose proxy voting conflicts of interests,\" he said. This proposal became effective this month.</p><p>\"We had been fighting for this rule change for 14 years, but suddenly after H-P/Compaq, it was like a light bulb went on among the regulators,\" Minow says.</p><p>She says this ruling will have a huge impact on how investors allocate their funds. \"People are going to take a critical look at whether they want to stay in a fund that supports management no matter what.\"</p><p>So Long, Unanimity Argument</p><p>Another likely result of the Battle of Palo Alto will be a decreased use of the unanimity argument in deal negotiations. In H-P/Compaq, H-P management encouraged Hewlett to support the deal on the basis that the parties wanted to present the merger as being unanimously supported by both boards. Without such a consensus, there was concern that the deal would cost H-P more.</p><p>\"I think this negotiating strategy will be used less often,\" says Fleischer, Vice Chairman of private equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe, who was among Walter Hewlett's principal advisers.</p><p>Minow calls the unanimity argument \"a recipe for disaster that undercuts the concept of director approval.\" She agrees with Fleischer that post-H-P/Compaq, people won't write a unanimity clause into a deal or use it as a negotiating tool.</p><p>Proxy Pros Weigh In</p><p>Wilcox says that H-P/Compaq shifts the balance somewhat in proxy fights toward shareholders. \"Usually, in the proxy system, the deck is stacked in favor of management, but since H-P/Compaq, these contests are getting more winnable by dissidents,\" he says. He attributes this change to the rise of better-educated shareholders.</p><p>Another effect of H-P/Compaq, he adds, is the likelihood that companies will nail down all details of a deal or a proposal before presenting it to shareholders.</p><p>Wilcox also says there will be an increased emphasis in dealing with any dissident positions early on. \"You're seeing more debate at earlier stages in the process to deal with peoples' objections to deals or proposals.\"</p><p>Some examples of this trend can be seen in Haggar</p><p>Copyright 2003 Thomson Media Inc.

Arguably, however, it may be better remembered as a spark plug for an improvement in shareholder democracy and development of new methodologies for selling controversial deals to an increasingly choosey shareholder population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal has been called many things: a civil war in Palo Alto, the last gasp of the Bubble Economy, the triumph of a crass newcomer - H-P CEO Carly Fiorina - over the company's traditional values as embodied by director Walter Hewlett. Hewlett, son of H-P co-founder Bill Hewlett, fought against the merger in a highly charged proxy contest that led to a potentially important court decision in Delaware. Ultimately, the deal closed in May 2002 after enough charges and countercharges to fill the plot line of a soap opera.</p><p>Now that the smoke has cleared from the most expensive proxy battle ever, it's a good time to assess the impact on proxy contests in general and voting battles specifically centering on m&amp;a in a era of heightened shareholder vigilance. In one key phase of the dispute, Delaware Chancellor William B. Chandler rejected Hewlett's complaint alleging that H-P improperly solicited votes from institutional holder Deutsche Bank but inserted a comment in the opinion that he didn't like the way the contacts were handled. Many m&amp;a lawyers held that the unsolicited comment should put companies on guard in talking with institutional shareholders that wore multiple hats, i.e., lender, finance consulting, pension management, etc.</p><p>Merger pros, not surprisingly, had different assessments of the contested deal's impact on subsequent m&amp;a proxy contests.</p><p>\"H-P/Compaq will have a lasting impact on m&amp;a,\" says Patrick McGurn, a Senior Vice President at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a shareholder advisory group. He says that one effect is that any deal will be more highly scrutinized by shareholders.</p><p>H-P outside counsel, Lawrence Sonsini, a partner in the Palo Alto law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati, says that after H-P/Compaq a company has to be prepared to be open and candid during the proxy process. He notes that H-P made 300 separate regulatory filings in the course of the proxy fight.</p><p>Sonsini adds that H-P/Compaq \"raises the bar for getting complex deals sold.\" In the new environment companies have to demonstrate what the cost savings are and what the synergies are, he states.</p><p>McGurn says that a number of deals that were completed in the 1990s would have wilted under the pressures that H-P/Compaq has created. He cites the combination of First Union Corp.and Wachovia Corp., which was opposed by southeastern banking rival SunTrust Banks Inc., as a deal that wouldn't have made it to the finish line had it come out of the gate after the epic H-P/Compaq struggle.</p><p>Proxy expert Richard Grubaugh, a Senior Vice President at D.F. King &amp; Co., says, \"Walter Hewlett's fight gave all large stockholders a precedent for second-guessing management.\"</p><p>And in an indication of the strong feelings generated by last year's corporate battle, one expert on shareholder rights summed up its effect. \"You can't buy votes anymore,\" says Charles Elson, Director of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance.</p><p>H-P did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Another corporate governance expert, Paul Lapides, Director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Kenesaw State University in Georgia, says that the publicity around H-P/ Compaq has drawn increased attention to merger proxy battles from regulators. \"Whether it takes the form of litigation or legislation, I think the government is going to be looking for any trading-votes-for-business conflicts that appear,\" he remarks.</p><p>H-P/Compaq Recap</p><p>H-P's bid for Compaq was launched in the summer of 2001 but Walter Hewlett objected to the proposed merger and launched a proxy battle against it. The election seemed to be decided in March 2002 with a pro-merger margin of victory of 45 million votes. But Hewlett contested the results in the Delaware Chancery Court, based on two complaints. He alleged that H-P had misled shareholders by presenting overly rosy forecasts for the deal. He also claimed that the company twisted arms, most notably of Deutsche Bank's asset management unit, in order to get the German-based bank to put the shares it held behind the deal.</p><p>Neither of these arguments prevailed.</p><p>Chandler ruled in May 2002 that Hewlett hadn't proved either of his contentions but included language that questioned the propriety of a conference call between H-P executives and Deutsche Bank asset management personnel. He says the events raise questions \"about the integrity of the internal ethical wall that purportedly separates\" Deutsche Bank's asset management arm from its investment banking operations.</p><p>The upshot was that people who didn't like the deal in the first place had reason to feel that H-P cheated. For the merger's supporters, H-P had won the vote fair and square.</p><p>But for all the pubic acrimony, proxy expert John Wilcox, a director at proxy solicitation and advice firm Georgeson Shareholder, says that H-P/Compaq was one of the cleanest and most focused battles he has seen. \"This was a fight about business strategy and strategic direction.\" By contrast, he notes, most proxy battles are a fight between people who want to control the assets.</p><p>Going Forward</p><p>Whether or not they believe that Chinese walls were pierced and quid pro quos were employed in H-P's successful campaign to win the proxy vote, dealmakers should be aware of the lessons of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle.</p><p>McGurn says that Walter Hewlett's battle to undo the merger has taken away the stigma from board members voting against management on mergers. \"He (Hewlett) comes out of the fight beaten, but unbowed,\" McGurn states.</p><p>In the wake of Hewlett's battle, dealmakers and their advisers noted a number of changes in how proxy battles in m&amp;a situations will be conducted. But before delving into some of these specific changes, it must be acknowledged that the H-P/Compaq struggle did not occur in a vacuum.</p><p>The crisis at Enron Corp. had surfaced during the proxy battle, but the WorldCom Inc., Tyco International Ltd., Adelphia Communications Corp., Rite-Aid Corp., and other corporate scandals were not yet on the public's radar screen. Since H-P/Compaq closed in May 2002, regulators have imposed a $1.4 billion settlement over analyst conflicts on 10 Wall Street investment firms and Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley governance and disclosure law to restore trust in Corporate America. All of these developments, combined with the lessons from H-P/Compaq, have created the current climate in which dealmakers face higher thresholds of persuasion to sell their deals to management and shareholders.</p><p>Two common denominators among these events are that buying businesses has become frowned on and that Chinese walls have been patched or re-erected. Walter Hewlett's lawsuit protesting the outcome of the proxy battle accused H-P of either causing or profiting from both of these activities. That said, the Delaware court ruled in H-P's favor.</p><p>So while a number of commentators agree that among the results of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle is increased suspicion of management, greater pressure to justify deals, and a higher standard of persuasion needed for any number of strategic moves, they caution that it is not H-P/Compaq alone that has rewritten the rules. But it is one major factor that has influenced a number of the changes and trends in m&amp;a proxy battles going forward.</p><p>A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats</p><p>According to Nell Minow, Editor of The Corporate Library, an investment research firm specializing in corporate governance and board effectiveness, one effect of the H-P/Compaq merger battle is an unprecedented level of support for shareholder resolutions in general. \"H-P/Compaq makes the world safe for directors and shareholders to question strategy. If it had occurred earlier, there might not have been an Enron,\" she says.</p><p>McGurn also connects the increased level of shareholder activism that he says he is seeing this year to the influence of H-P/Compaq. He says that Capital Research &amp; Management Co. executive Gordon Crawford's call for AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steve Case's resignation at the company's shareholders' meeting in August 2002 was partially a result of the changed climate created in part by the H-P/Compaq battle. The atmosphere in which a major institutional shareholder would speak out is a result of H-P/Compaq, he notes. \"You haven't seen mainstream investors go public with their dissatisfactions with management before,\" he adds.</p><p>While H-P set new standards for expense, publicity, and public relations battles in contested mergers, it also had a broader effect in the world of corporate governance.</p><p>Now, issues such as staggered terms, poison pills, and executive pay in addition to change-of-control proposals have become easier to broach, if not win, in the wake of H-P/Compaq.</p><p>Spencer Fleischer, a San Francisco-based investment banker, says that H-P/Compaq has increased pressure for more explicit disclosure of executive compensation. During the proxy battle, Fiorina said that Compaq CEO Michael Capellas would remain with the company as operations chief to make sure that the integration was successful. But his pay arrangements gave him $14.4 million if he left within a year. In November, six months after H-P/Compaq closed, Capellas accepted the chief executive job at MCI Communications Corp., as the re-launched WorldCom is now known.</p><p>Minow says that a development that it is hard to pin directly to H-P/Compaq, but which she believes was strongly affected by the proxy battle, is the action taken by the SEC a few months after the big tech merger.</p><p>The agency issued a proposal in September 2002 that will require mutual funds and other registered management investment companies to disclose their votes in proxy battles.</p><p>\"These proposals would give investors fundamental information about the practices of those who vote proxies on their behalf,\" said then-SEC chairman Harvey Pitt. \"They would also discourage or expose proxy voting conflicts of interests,\" he said. This proposal became effective this month.</p><p>\"We had been fighting for this rule change for 14 years, but suddenly after H-P/Compaq, it was like a light bulb went on among the regulators,\" Minow says.</p><p>She says this ruling will have a huge impact on how investors allocate their funds. \"People are going to take a critical look at whether they want to stay in a fund that supports management no matter what.\"</p><p>So Long, Unanimity Argument</p><p>Another likely result of the Battle of Palo Alto will be a decreased use of the unanimity argument in deal negotiations. In H-P/Compaq, H-P management encouraged Hewlett to support the deal on the basis that the parties wanted to present the merger as being unanimously supported by both boards. Without such a consensus, there was concern that the deal would cost H-P more.</p><p>\"I think this negotiating strategy will be used less often,\" says Fleischer, Vice Chairman of private equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe, who was among Walter Hewlett's principal advisers.</p><p>Minow calls the unanimity argument \"a recipe for disaster that undercuts the concept of director approval.\" She agrees with Fleischer that post-H-P/Compaq, people won't write a unanimity clause into a deal or use it as a negotiating tool.</p><p>Proxy Pros Weigh In</p><p>Wilcox says that H-P/Compaq shifts the balance somewhat in proxy fights toward shareholders. \"Usually, in the proxy system, the deck is stacked in favor of management, but since H-P/Compaq, these contests are getting more winnable by dissidents,\" he says. He attributes this change to the rise of better-educated shareholders.</p><p>Another effect of H-P/Compaq, he adds, is the likelihood that companies will nail down all details of a deal or a proposal before presenting it to shareholders.</p><p>Wilcox also says there will be an increased emphasis in dealing with any dissident positions early on. \"You're seeing more debate at earlier stages in the process to deal with peoples' objections to deals or proposals.\"</p><p>Some examples of this trend can be seen in Haggar</p><p>Copyright 2003 Thomson Media Inc.

Arguably, however, it may be better remembered as a spark plug for an improvement in shareholder democracy and development of new methodologies for selling controversial deals to an increasingly choosey shareholder population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal has been called many things: a civil war in Palo Alto, the last gasp of the Bubble Economy, the triumph of a crass newcomer - H-P CEO Carly Fiorina - over the company's traditional values as embodied by director Walter Hewlett. Hewlett, son of H-P co-founder Bill Hewlett, fought against the merger in a highly charged proxy contest that led to a potentially important court decision in Delaware. Ultimately, the deal closed in May 2002 after enough charges and countercharges to fill the plot line of a soap opera.</p><p>Now that the smoke has cleared from the most expensive proxy battle ever, it's a good time to assess the impact on proxy contests in general and voting battles specifically centering on m&amp;a in a era of heightened shareholder vigilance. In one key phase of the dispute, Delaware Chancellor William B. Chandler rejected Hewlett's complaint alleging that H-P improperly solicited votes from institutional holder Deutsche Bank but inserted a comment in the opinion that he didn't like the way the contacts were handled. Many m&amp;a lawyers held that the unsolicited comment should put companies on guard in talking with institutional shareholders that wore multiple hats, i.e., lender, finance consulting, pension management, etc.</p><p>Merger pros, not surprisingly, had different assessments of the contested deal's impact on subsequent m&amp;a proxy contests.</p><p>\"H-P/Compaq will have a lasting impact on m&amp;a,\" says Patrick McGurn, a Senior Vice President at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a shareholder advisory group. He says that one effect is that any deal will be more highly scrutinized by shareholders.</p><p>H-P outside counsel, Lawrence Sonsini, a partner in the Palo Alto law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich &amp; Rosati, says that after H-P/Compaq a company has to be prepared to be open and candid during the proxy process. He notes that H-P made 300 separate regulatory filings in the course of the proxy fight.</p><p>Sonsini adds that H-P/Compaq \"raises the bar for getting complex deals sold.\" In the new environment companies have to demonstrate what the cost savings are and what the synergies are, he states.</p><p>McGurn says that a number of deals that were completed in the 1990s would have wilted under the pressures that H-P/Compaq has created. He cites the combination of First Union Corp.and Wachovia Corp., which was opposed by southeastern banking rival SunTrust Banks Inc., as a deal that wouldn't have made it to the finish line had it come out of the gate after the epic H-P/Compaq struggle.</p><p>Proxy expert Richard Grubaugh, a Senior Vice President at D.F. King &amp; Co., says, \"Walter Hewlett's fight gave all large stockholders a precedent for second-guessing management.\"</p><p>And in an indication of the strong feelings generated by last year's corporate battle, one expert on shareholder rights summed up its effect. \"You can't buy votes anymore,\" says Charles Elson, Director of the University of Delaware's Center for Corporate Governance.</p><p>H-P did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Another corporate governance expert, Paul Lapides, Director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Kenesaw State University in Georgia, says that the publicity around H-P/ Compaq has drawn increased attention to merger proxy battles from regulators. \"Whether it takes the form of litigation or legislation, I think the government is going to be looking for any trading-votes-for-business conflicts that appear,\" he remarks.</p><p>H-P/Compaq Recap</p><p>H-P's bid for Compaq was launched in the summer of 2001 but Walter Hewlett objected to the proposed merger and launched a proxy battle against it. The election seemed to be decided in March 2002 with a pro-merger margin of victory of 45 million votes. But Hewlett contested the results in the Delaware Chancery Court, based on two complaints. He alleged that H-P had misled shareholders by presenting overly rosy forecasts for the deal. He also claimed that the company twisted arms, most notably of Deutsche Bank's asset management unit, in order to get the German-based bank to put the shares it held behind the deal.</p><p>Neither of these arguments prevailed.</p><p>Chandler ruled in May 2002 that Hewlett hadn't proved either of his contentions but included language that questioned the propriety of a conference call between H-P executives and Deutsche Bank asset management personnel. He says the events raise questions \"about the integrity of the internal ethical wall that purportedly separates\" Deutsche Bank's asset management arm from its investment banking operations.</p><p>The upshot was that people who didn't like the deal in the first place had reason to feel that H-P cheated. For the merger's supporters, H-P had won the vote fair and square.</p><p>But for all the pubic acrimony, proxy expert John Wilcox, a director at proxy solicitation and advice firm Georgeson Shareholder, says that H-P/Compaq was one of the cleanest and most focused battles he has seen. \"This was a fight about business strategy and strategic direction.\" By contrast, he notes, most proxy battles are a fight between people who want to control the assets.</p><p>Going Forward</p><p>Whether or not they believe that Chinese walls were pierced and quid pro quos were employed in H-P's successful campaign to win the proxy vote, dealmakers should be aware of the lessons of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle.</p><p>McGurn says that Walter Hewlett's battle to undo the merger has taken away the stigma from board members voting against management on mergers. \"He (Hewlett) comes out of the fight beaten, but unbowed,\" McGurn states.</p><p>In the wake of Hewlett's battle, dealmakers and their advisers noted a number of changes in how proxy battles in m&amp;a situations will be conducted. But before delving into some of these specific changes, it must be acknowledged that the H-P/Compaq struggle did not occur in a vacuum.</p><p>The crisis at Enron Corp. had surfaced during the proxy battle, but the WorldCom Inc., Tyco International Ltd., Adelphia Communications Corp., Rite-Aid Corp., and other corporate scandals were not yet on the public's radar screen. Since H-P/Compaq closed in May 2002, regulators have imposed a $1.4 billion settlement over analyst conflicts on 10 Wall Street investment firms and Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley governance and disclosure law to restore trust in Corporate America. All of these developments, combined with the lessons from H-P/Compaq, have created the current climate in which dealmakers face higher thresholds of persuasion to sell their deals to management and shareholders.</p><p>Two common denominators among these events are that buying businesses has become frowned on and that Chinese walls have been patched or re-erected. Walter Hewlett's lawsuit protesting the outcome of the proxy battle accused H-P of either causing or profiting from both of these activities. That said, the Delaware court ruled in H-P's favor.</p><p>So while a number of commentators agree that among the results of the H-P/Compaq proxy battle is increased suspicion of management, greater pressure to justify deals, and a higher standard of persuasion needed for any number of strategic moves, they caution that it is not H-P/Compaq alone that has rewritten the rules. But it is one major factor that has influenced a number of the changes and trends in m&amp;a proxy battles going forward.</p><p>A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats</p><p>According to Nell Minow, Editor of The Corporate Library, an investment research firm specializing in corporate governance and board effectiveness, one effect of the H-P/Compaq merger battle is an unprecedented level of support for shareholder resolutions in general. \"H-P/Compaq makes the world safe for directors and shareholders to question strategy. If it had occurred earlier, there might not have been an Enron,\" she says.</p><p>McGurn also connects the increased level of shareholder activism that he says he is seeing this year to the influence of H-P/Compaq. He says that Capital Research &amp; Management Co. executive Gordon Crawford's call for AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steve Case's resignation at the company's shareholders' meeting in August 2002 was partially a result of the changed climate created in part by the H-P/Compaq battle. The atmosphere in which a major institutional shareholder would speak out is a result of H-P/Compaq, he notes. \"You haven't seen mainstream investors go public with their dissatisfactions with management before,\" he adds.</p><p>While H-P set new standards for expense, publicity, and public relations battles in contested mergers, it also had a broader effect in the world of corporate governance.</p><p>Now, issues such as staggeredterms, poison pills, and executive pay in addition to change-of-control proposals have become easier to broach, if not win, in the wake of H-P/Compaq.</p><p>Spencer Fleischer, a San Francisco-based investment banker, says that H-P/Compaq has increased pressure for more explicit disclosure of executive compensation. During the proxy battle, Fiorina said that Compaq CEO Michael Capellas would remain with the company as operations chief to make sure that the integration was successful. But his pay arrangements gave him $14.4 million if he left within a year. In November, six months after H-P/Compaq closed, Capellas accepted the chief executive job at MCI Communications Corp., as the re-launched WorldCom is now known.</p><p>Minow says that a development that it is hard to pin directly to H-P/Compaq, but which she believes was strongly affected by the proxy battle, is the action taken by the SEC a few months after the big tech merger.</p><p>The agency issued a proposal in September 2002 that will require mutual funds and other registered management investment companies to disclose their votes in proxy battles.</p><p>\"These proposals would give investors fundamental information about the practices of those who vote proxies on their behalf,\" said then-SEC chairman Harvey Pitt. \"They would also discourage or expose proxy voting conflicts of interests,\" he said. This proposal became effective this month.</p><p>\"We had been fighting for this rule change for 14 years, but suddenly after H-P/Compaq, it was like a light bulb went on among the regulators,\" Minow says.</p><p>She says this ruling will have a huge impact on how investors allocate their funds. \"People are going to take a critical look at whether they want to stay in a fund that supports management no matter what.\"</p><p>So Long, Unanimity Argument</p><p>Another likely result of the Battle of Palo Alto will be a decreased use of the unanimity argument in deal negotiations. In H-P/Compaq, H-P management encouraged Hewlett to support the deal on the basis that the parties wanted to present the merger as being unanimously supported by both boards. Without such a consensus, there was concern that the deal would cost H-P more.</p><p>\"I think this negotiating strategy will be used less often,\" says Fleischer, Vice Chairman of private equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe, who was among Walter Hewlett's principal advisers.</p><p>Minow calls the unanimity argument \"a recipe for disaster that undercuts the concept of director approval.\" She agrees with Fleischer that post-H-P/Compaq, people won't write a unanimity clause into a deal or use it as a negotiating tool.</p><p>Proxy Pros Weigh In</p><p>Wilcox says that H-P/Compaq shifts the balance somewhat in proxy fights toward shareholders. \"Usually, in the proxy system, the deck is stacked in favor of management, but since H-P/Compaq, these contests are getting more winnable by dissidents,\" he says.

But they have a problem: Much of the cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries comes from a country where children work in mines. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A CNN investigation has found that child labor is still being used to mine the valuable mineral at some operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This country produces about two-thirds of the world's cobalt and is estimated to sit atop half of the globe's reserves. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There have been warnings about child labor before -- Amnesty International highlighted the problem in 2016 and Glencore, a leading cobalt producer, said last month that some small mines in the DRC are using children. </p><p>The problem may be getting worse. Rising demand has led cobalt prices to quadruple in the past two years, and that helped boost production at so-called artisanal miners in the DRC by 18% in 2017, according to Andries Gerbens at Darton Commodities. </p><p>Glencore said it does not process or buy any materials from these informal mines, which are often small-scale operations in local communities.</p><p>But, as CNN found, it isn't easy for companies to avoid using cobalt from these smaller mines. Dealers at markets in the DRC were filmed buying cobalt without verifying its source and mining method. They then send it for processing where it is mixed with cobalt from other mines before ending up in batteries that power devices around the world.</p><p>Cut out the middlemen?</p><p>BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-owner Daimler acknowledged how difficult it is to verify the source.</p><p>BMW said it makes \"every effort to ensure the highest possible standards in the labor practices of our suppliers\" but admitted it could do more. </p><p>Now, it's considering buying the prized mineral directly from miners to avoid operations that exploit children. </p><p>\"A further step could be to purchase directly from miners, which is an option we are looking into,\" BMW told CNN.</p><p>Apple, which stopped sourcing from artisanal mines last year, is also reported to be in talks to buy cobalt directly from regulated mines in the DRC. It declined to comment on those reports. </p><p>Daimler told CNN it was rolling out new processes requiring suppliers \"to disclose their supply chain right through to the mine.\"</p><p>Volkswagen -- which has plans to launch dozens of new electric cars -- has introduced new rules for all its suppliers to ensure there's no child labor in the supply chain.</p><p>\"To put it quite clearly, if any supplier or any subcontractor of any supplier does not adhere to these rules and initiate the necessary action, we will be forced to stop dealing with the supplier in case of doubt,\" it said in December.</p><p>Renault told CNN it was conducting audits of companies in its cobalt supply chain and, if required, it could \"reconsider commercial relations unless significant progress is made.\" </p><p>CNN contacted several other companies to ask how they ensured child labor was blocked out of their supply chain.</p><p>The firms listed various initiatives and industry standards they follow, but most did not provide full details about their suppliers.</p><p>Tesla, which uses several pounds of cobalt in each of its car batteries, told CNN it sourced most of its cobalt from suppliers outside the DRC and was \"committed to only sourcing responsibly-produced materials.\"</p><p>\"Tesla performs on-site audits to the best of our ability during the sourcing and vetting process for suppliers, to view operations and methods of risk management,\" it said in a statement. But it did not respond when asked to confirm its cobalt was 100% free from child labor. </p><p>A Tesla 2017 financial filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged that the company's supply chain wasn't watertight when it came to tracking raw materials.</p><p>\"Many of our [direct] suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly and instead obtain them from downstream suppliers and sub-suppliers. Therefore, reliably determining the origin [of materials] is a difficult task,\" it said.</p><p>Samsung said it was aware of concerns about underage cobalt workers in the DRC and was working to improve its supply chain and due diligence processes.</p><p>GM said it has a \"zero-tolerance policy against the use of child labor in the supply of goods and services to GM and its subsidiaries.\" It said it finances \"training for our suppliers located in high risk areas\" and is part of initiatives designed to encourage the responsible mining and processing of cobalt.</p><p>The China connection</p><p>More than half of all cobalt passes through China at some point in the supply chain, according to Darton Commodities.</p><p>Renault said its battery supply chain included the Chinese mining group Huayou, the parent company of Congo Dongfang International Mining, which was accused by Amnesty International in 2016 of purchasing cobalt produced in areas of the DRC \"where child labor is rife.\" </p><p>Huayou responded to the accusations, telling CNN it had \"suspended\" cobalt purchases from artisanal miners that sold their minerals in DRC's open markets.</p><p>\"Huayou stands alone as the only Chinese cobalt company [which has] begun to actively address the ethical sourcing challenges related to DRC cobalt,\" it said. </p><p>Whistleblowers speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity alleged that Huayou still continues to buy from artisanal mines via subcontractors. CNN alerted Huayou to these findings and the company said it has launched an investigation.</p><p>No disclosure requirement</p><p>In 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules requiring companies to report detailed information about their supply chains for so-called \"conflict minerals,\" including gold, tungsten and tin. The rules were put in place to ensure that companies were not inadvertently financing or benefiting armed groups in the DRC when buying these minerals.</p><p>Cobalt was not included on the list of \"conflict minerals,\" allowing companies to be less stringent in their tracking.</p><p>Similar regulations set to take effect in the European Union in 2021 also do not apply to cobalt. </p><p>Richard Muyej, governor of Lualaba Province in the south of the DRC, spoke to CNN and acknowledged that problems persisted in some mines but the situation has been improving over the years.</p><p>\"The way forward is not always easy, we have to break habits, change attitudes and people are in a vulnerable position financially,\" he said.</p><p>He also expressed his frustration with the stark contrast between his country's persistent poverty and the wealth big companies reap from the region's cobalt.</p><p>(Read more from the interview with the governor here.)</p><p>\"We must work together to make the issue of traceability transparent and to make the sites safe and regularized,\" he said, adding that Apple and Samsung were some of the region's biggest cobalt consumers but he had never met with representatives from these companies.</p><p>\"If [these multinational firms] have the correct intention to work with us on traceability in a proper manner, they should come and see us,\" he said.</p><p>-- CNN's Nima Elbagir, Dominique Van Heerden and Eliza Mackintosh contributed to this report.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But they have a problem: Much of the cobalt used in lithium-ion batteries comes from a country where children work in mines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A CNN investigation has found that child labor is still being used to mine the valuable mineral at some operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This country produces about two-thirds of the world's cobalt and is estimated to sit atop half of the globe's reserves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There have been warnings about child labor before -- Amnesty International highlighted the problem in 2016 and Glencore, a leading cobalt producer, said last month that some small mines in the DRC are using children.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>The problem may be getting worse. Rising demand has led cobalt prices to quadruple in the past two years, and that helped boost production at so-called artisanal mines in the DRC by 18% in 2017, according to Andries Gerbens at Darton Commodities.</p><p>Glencore said it does not process or buy any materials from these informal mines, which are often small-scale operations in local communities.</p><p>But, as CNN found, it isn't easy for companies to avoid using cobalt from these smaller mines. Dealers at markets in the DRC were filmed buying cobalt without verifying its source and mining method. They then send it for processing where it is mixed with cobalt from other mines before ending up in batteries that power devices around the world.</p><p>Cut out the middlemen?</p><p>BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-owner Daimler acknowledged how difficult it is to verify the source.</p><p>BMW said it makes \"every effort to ensure the highest possible standards in the labor practices of our suppliers\" but admitted it could do more.</p><p>Now, it's considering buying the prized mineral directly from miners to avoid operations that exploit children.</p><p>\"A further step could be to purchase directly from miners, which is an option we are looking into,\" BMW told CNN.</p><p>Apple, which stopped sourcing from artisanal mines last year, is also reported to be in talks to buy cobalt directly from regulated mines in the DRC. It declined to comment on those reports.</p><p>Daimler told CNN it was rolling out new processes requiring suppliers \"to disclose their supply chain right through to the mine.\"</p><p>Volkswagen -- which has plans to launch dozens of new electric cars -- has introduced new rules for all its suppliers to ensure there's no child labor in the supply chain.</p><p>\"To put it quite clearly, if any supplier or any subcontractor of any supplier does not adhere to these rules and initiate the necessary action, we will be forced to stop dealing with the supplier in case of doubt,\" it said in December.</p><p>Renault told CNN it was conducting audits of companies in its cobalt supply chain and, if required, it could \"reconsider commercial relations unless significant progress is made.\"</p><p>CNN contacted several other companies to ask how they ensured child labor was blocked out of their supply chain.</p><p>The firms listed various initiatives and industry standards they follow, but most did not provide full details about their suppliers.</p><p/><p>Tesla, which uses several pounds of cobalt in each of its car batteries, told CNN it sourced most of its cobalt from suppliers outside the DRC and was \"committed to only sourcing responsibly-produced materials.\"</p><p>\"Tesla performs on-site audits to the best of our ability during the sourcing and vetting process for suppliers, to view operations and methods of risk management,\" it said in a statement. But it did not respond when asked to confirm its cobalt was 100% free from child labor.</p><p>A Tesla 2017 financial filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledged that the company's supply chain wasn't watertight when it came to tracking raw materials.</p><p>\"Many of our [direct] suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly and instead obtain them from downstream suppliers and sub-suppliers. Therefore, reliably determining the origin [of materials] is a difficult task,\" it said.</p><p>Samsung said it was aware of concerns about underage cobalt workers in the DRC and was working to improve its supply chain and due diligence processes.</p><p>GM said it has a \"zero-tolerance policy against the use of child labor in the supply of goods and services to GM and its subsidiaries.\" It said it finances \"training for our suppliers located in high risk areas\" and is part of initiatives designed to encourage the responsible mining and processing of cobalt.</p><p>The China connection</p><p>More than half of all cobalt passes through China at some point in the supply chain, according to Darton Commodities.</p><p>Renault said its battery supply chain included the Chinese mining group Huayou, the parent company of Congo Dongfang International Mining, which was accused by Amnesty International in 2016 of purchasing cobalt produced in areas of the DRC \"where child labor is rife.\"</p><p>Huayou responded to the accusations, telling CNN it had \"suspended\" cobalt purchases from artisanal miners that sold their minerals in DRC's open markets.</p><p>\"Huayou stands alone as the only Chinese cobalt company [which has] begun to actively address the ethical sourcing challenges related to DRC cobalt,\" it said.</p><p>Whistleblowers speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity alleged that Huayou still continues to buy from artisanal mines via subcontractors. CNN alerted Huayou to these findings and the company said it has launched an investigation.</p><p>No disclosure requirement</p><p>In 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission introduced rules requiring companies to report detailed information about their supply chains for so-called \"conflict minerals,\" including gold, tungsten and tin. The rules were put in place to ensure that companies were not inadvertently financing or benefiting armed groups in the DRC when buying these minerals.</p><p>Cobalt was not included on the list of \"conflict minerals,\" allowing companies to be less stringent in their tracking.</p><p>Similar regulations set to take effect in the European Union in 2021 also do not apply to cobalt.</p><p>Richard Muyej, governor of Lualaba Province in the south of the DRC, spoke to CNN and acknowledged that problems persisted in some mines but the situation has been improving over the years.</p><p>\"The way forward is not always easy, we have to break habits, change attitudes and people are in a vulnerable position financially,\" he said.</p><p>He also expressed his frustration with the stark contrast between his country's persistent poverty and the wealth big companies reap from the region's cobalt.</p><p>(Read more from the interview with the governor here.)</p><p>\"We must work together to make the issue of traceability transparent and to make the sites safe and regularized,\" he said, adding that Apple and Samsung were some of the region's biggest cobalt consumers but he had never met with representatives from these companies.</p><p>\"If [these multinational firms] have the correct intention to work with us on traceability in a proper manner, they should come and see us,\" he said.</p><p>-- CNN's Nima Elbagir, Dominique van Heerden and Eliza Mackintosh contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180413cobalt-congo-child-labor-car-smartphone-batteries1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7C-FV11-JBPX-W23X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1180\"/><timeReceived>2:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 13, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000264W</classCode><className>BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG (BMW)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336991 MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE &amp;

But there's an exact date when anyone watching the car industry should have realised that things were never going to be the same again: May 26, 2014.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was the day when James May, one of the three irredeemable revheads fronting Top Gear, announced he was buying an electric car.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"An electric car is a bit cool. Why? I suppose because the environmental pretence makes it quite fashionable. Driving an electric car is being the change you want to see in the world, or whatever hipsters say,\" he said at the time. \"Sneaking around town in complete silence, mowing down unsuspecting pedestrians ... it's the fuzzy edge, the avant garde. And that's me. You should see some of the shapes I throw out on the floor.\"</p><p>Now, though, things are getting serious. A market of more than a billion people is following in May's footsteps. In January, sales of electric cars in China skyrocketed 188 per cent, and sales of hybrids jumped 53 per cent. Electric cars' share of new-car sales is still single-digit, but Chinese sales of regular petrol and diesel cars are in freefall.</p><p>Even in gas-guzzling America, sales of electric cars and hybrids in 2018 rose 81 per cent from a year earlier, despite subsidies beginning to phase out for market leader Tesla.</p><p>The tectonic plates are shifting in the automotive world, shaking this venerable pillar of global manufacturing to its foundations.</p><p>Diesel sales have plummeted in Europe as tougher emissions standards push consumers to petrol, hybrids and electric. Urban Millennials in Europe and Asia are eschewing car ownership - and even driving in general - for the flexibility of Uber and its ilk. Autonomous vehicles are accelerating towards us from over the horizon and it's mostly big tech, not the established car companies, who are putting pedal to the metal.</p><p>Whereas these kinds of shifts used to unfold at the sedate pace of a Rolls-Royce, the dynamism of the huge Chinese market means change can now happen at near-breakneck speed. If electric cars need a huge infrastructure rollout, it will inch along in the West - a few parking slots here, the odd recharging site at a petrol station there - while China throws the resources of the state at it and gets it done yesterday.</p><p>If all that isn't enough, politics is once again back-seat-driving the car industry, as trade - both the done deals and the dogfights - weighs heavily on investment and location decisions.</p><p>When President Trump last week said simply \"I like tariffs\", a tide of fear would have rippled across the Continent, which does (EURO)44 billion ($70 billion) of two-way automotive trade with the US each year. Volkswagen's CEO admits that a 25 per cent American tariff could wipe up to (EURO)2.5 billion, or 13 per cent, from the company's annual earnings.</p><p>\"In the history of the auto industry this is probably the greatest period of change they'll ever face,\" says Chris Connolly, London-based portfolio manager at Antipodes Partners.</p><p>It's tempting to see the established carmakers as lumbering industrial dinosaurs, unable to weather a changing commercial and political climate, or move nimbly enough to protect their turf from new entrants.</p><p>But Connolly cautions against this view, seeing their age more as evidence of their resilience.</p><p>'It's not like they haven't faced change before, and there's a reason why the same companies have been around so long,\" he says. \"It's a fantastically difficult business; the challenge of profitably manufacturing cars is really hard, and they are proven competitors.\"</p><p>Honda, the world's seventh-largest car maker, is certainly a proven competitor. Profits were shaky at the end of last year, but sales and turnover were still growing. So it came as quite a shock when the company called time on Europe, shuttering factories in Britain and Turkey over the next two years with the loss of 4600 jobs.</p><p>\"This is being driven by some really big and unprecedented changes in what we're seeing in our motor vehicle industry,\" Ian Howells, senior vice-president for Europe, told the BBC.</p><p>\"The move to electrification: we've started to see it in Europe, we've started to see it around the world. It's in response to what our consumers are looking at, and also what regulation is driving us towards.\"</p><p>In the political arena, the finger of blame for Honda's move was still pointed at Brexit. Paradoxically, though, an ostensibly much more positive piece of trade news may also have been a factor.</p><p>Japan has just signed a landmark free-trade deal with the European Union, meaning Japanese-made cars can be shipped into the bloc tariff-free. That removes a key reason to make them in Europe - particularly when the much larger Japanese factory can spit them out much more cheaply.</p><p>That's just one example of how politics and regulation insert themselves into this most iconic of industries.</p><p>There has always been a deep and complex relationship between government and the motor business, involving politics and patriotism as much as economics. But the political response to climate change has shifted the gears - and has hastened the electric revolution, which is now creating such daunting investment conundrums for the traditional players.</p><p>Europe is leading the charge to electric vehicles because it's ahead of the curve on driving reductions in carbon emissions. The market share of diesel cars dropped from 45 per cent to 36.5 per cent in a single year, with new diesel sales falling 16 per cent as total car sales rose 3 per cent. The ongoing fallout from the \"dieselgate\" emissions testing scandal will disrupt the market still further.</p><p>In London, meanwhile, from early April anyone driving a \"polluting\" car into the city centre - with emissions standards defined quite tightly and the centre drawn quite widely - will pay \u00a312.50 (almost $23) a time.</p><p>Britain wants zero-emissions cars to be universal by 2040. Norway, which floods consumers with incentives to go green, wants to get there by 2025 - and almost 40 per cent of all new cars sold there are electric.</p><p>Over in China, electric vehicle take-up is soaring because the government wants to make it so. The 61.7 per cent increase in manufacture and sale of electric vehicles in 2018 followed a series of incentives: access to carpool lanes, avoidance of urban car ownership caps, subsidies and credits for manufacturers. The target is to get electric vehicles to a 20 per cent market share by 2025.</p><p>As ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said on Thursday, the path out of infancy for zero-emissions vehicles very much depends on governments setting the right incentives and supporting the early rollout of necessary infrastructure.</p><p>There are other government interventions that the car industry is finding much less welcome. Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs have pushed up commodity costs for the big two American carmakers, General Motors and Ford, by US$1 billion ($1.4 billion).</p><p>And now a trade war could be looming. The President has 90 days to consider the report from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which landed on his desk this past week, on whether imported vehicles pose a national security risk.</p><p>\"They're very tough to make a deal with, the EU. They've been very difficult over a period of time - over many, many years,\" he said on Wednesday. \"We're negotiating with them. If we don't make the deal, we'll do the tariffs.\"</p><p>A 25 per cent tariff, up from 2.5 per cent now, would slash Germany's car imports to the US by as much as (EURO)18.4 billion, according to Germany's ifo Institute, although the industry might be able to soften the blow through switching focus to other markets.</p><p>\"If these cars are viewed as a threat to US national security then we are alarmed,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last weekend.</p><p>American car makers will also be worried, as retaliatory European tariffs will hit the one-fifth of US car exports that are destined for Europe. As always, a trade war is unlikely to have any winners.</p><p>So let's tot it up. Trade tensions. Politically unpopular factory closures. Regulatory uncertainty, and increasing regulatory stringency. Rapidly changing technology, and nobody sure which technologies will prevail. Consumers' mercurial and evolving tastes, which may change in response to shifts in taxes, subsidies or technology. The path ahead looks perilous and potholed.</p><p>Still, at least the carmakers can take comfort that the traditional car market they know and love hasn't disappeared into the rear-view mirror just yet. For proof, look at James May: sure, he runs about in that new BMW i3 - much to Jeremy Clarkson's disgust, no doubt - but not always, as he revealed a year after buying it.</p><p>\"I'm in north Oxfordshire at the moment and I wanted to bring [my electric car] with me, but I realised that it was slightly too far to go, there and back. There isn't anywhere here to charge it, and in the end I had to come in my Porsche,\" he said. \"It was too wet for the Ferrari, unfortunately.\"P</p><p>WITH MICHAEL SMITH AND JACOB GREBERs</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc746q9etmhp11m2qvflh4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGJ-GJR1-F0J6-J47M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Urban Millennials in Europe and Asia are eschewing car ownership - and even driving in general - for the flexibility of Uber and its ilk. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/autonomous-vehicles-could-end-car-industry-and-be-either-boon-or-plague-report-says-20190212-h1b5mm\">Autonomous vehicles are accelerating towards us</url> from over the horizon and it's mostly big tech, not the established car companies, who are putting pedal to the metal.</p><p>Whereas these kinds of shifts used to unfold at the sedate pace of a Rolls-Royce, the dynamism of the huge Chinese market means change can now happen at near-breakneck speed. If electric cars need a huge infrastructure rollout, it will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/national-electric-car-network-should-be-a-top-priority-says-infrastructure-australia-20190213-h1b74y\">inch along in the West</url> - a few parking slots here, the odd recharging site at a petrol station there - while China throws the resources of the state at it and gets it done yesterday.</p><p>Evidence of their resilience</p><p>If all that isn't enough, politics is once again back-seat-driving the car industry, as trade - both the done deals and the dogfights - weighs heavily on investment and location decisions.</p><p>When President Trump last week said simply \"I like tariffs\", a tide of fear would have rippled across the Continent, which does ???44 billion ($70 billion) of two-way automotive trade with the US each year. Volkswagen's CEO admits that a 25 per cent American tariff could wipe up to ???2.5 billion, or 13 per cent, from the company's annual earnings.</p><p>\"In the history of the auto industry this is probably the greatest period of change they'll ever face,\" says Chris Connolly, London-based portfolio manager at Antipodes Partners.</p><p>It's tempting to see the established carmakers as lumbering industrial dinosaurs, unable to weather a changing commercial and political climate, or move nimbly enough to protect their turf from new entrants.</p><p>But Connolly cautions against this view, seeing their age more as evidence of their resilience.</p><p>\"It's not like they haven't faced change before, and there's a reason why the same companies have been around so long,\" he says. \"It's a fantastically difficult business; the challenge of profitably manufacturing cars is really hard, and they are proven competitors.\"</p><p>Honda, the world's seventh-largest car maker, is certainly a proven competitor. Profits were shaky at the end of last year, but sales and turnover were still growing. So it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/politics/world/hondas-hammer-blow-to-the-heart-of-uk-manufacturing-20190220-h1bho2\">came as quite a shock</url> when the company called time on Europe, shuttering factories in Britain and Turkey over the next two years with the loss of 4600 jobs.</p><p>\"This is being driven by some really big and unprecedented changes in what we're seeing in our motor vehicle industry,\" Ian Howells, senior vice-president for Europe, told the BBC.</p><p>\"The move to electrification: we've started to see it in Europe, we've started to see it around the world. It's in response to what our consumers are looking at, and also what regulation is driving us towards.\"</p><p>Landmark free-trade deal</p><p>In the political arena, the finger of blame for Honda's move was still pointed at Brexit. Paradoxically, though, an ostensibly much more positive piece of trade news may also have been a factor.</p><p>Japan has just signed a landmark free-trade deal with the European Union, meaning Japanese-made cars can be shipped into the bloc tariff-free. That removes a key reason to make them in Europe - particularly when the much larger Japanese factory can spit them out much more cheaply.</p><p>That's just one example of how politics and regulation insert themselves into this most iconic of industries.</p><p>There has always been a deep and complex relationship between government and the motor business, involving politics and patriotism as much as economics. But the political response to climate change has shifted the gears - and has hastened the electric revolution, which is now creating such daunting investment conundrums for the traditional players.</p><p>Europe is leading the charge to electric vehicles because it's ahead of the curve on driving reductions in carbon emissions. The market share of diesel cars dropped from 45 per cent to 36.5 per cent in a single year, with new diesel sales falling 16 per cent as total car sales rose 3 per cent. The ongoing fallout from the \"dieselgate\" emissions testing scandal will disrupt the market still further.</p><p>In London, meanwhile, from early April anyone driving a \"polluting\" car into the city centre - with emissions standards defined quite tightly and the centre drawn quite widely - will pay ??12.50 (almost $23) a time.</p><p>Britain wants zero-emissions cars to be universal by 2040. Norway, which floods consumers with incentives to go green, wants to get there by 2025 - and almost 40 per cent of all new cars sold there are electric.</p><p>Over in China, electric vehicle take-up is soaring because<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/transport/automobile/elon-musk-about-to-realise-his-dream-as-tesla-charges-into-china-20190219-h1bfpz\"> the government wants to make it so</url>. The 61.7 per cent increase in manufacture and sale of electric vehicles in 2018 followed a series of incentives: access to carpool lanes, avoidance of urban car ownership caps, subsidies and credits for manufacturers. The target is to get electric vehicles to a 20 per cent market share by 2025.</p><p>As ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said on Thursday, the path out of infancy for zero-emissions vehicles very much depends on governments setting the right incentives and supporting the early rollout of necessary infrastructure.</p><p>There are other government interventions that the car industry is finding much less welcome. Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs have pushed up commodity costs for the big two American carmakers, General Motors and Ford, by US$1 billion ($1.4 billion).</p><p>Retaliatory European tariffs</p><p>And now a trade war could be looming. The President has 90 days to consider the report from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/world/donald-trump-gives-china-a-final-chance-car-tariffs-next-20190219-h1bfce\">landed on his desk this past week</url>, on whether imported vehicles pose a national security risk.</p><p>\"They're very tough to make a deal with, the EU. They've been very difficult over a period of time - over many, many years,\" he said on Wednesday. \"We're negotiating with them. If we don't make the deal, we'll do the tariffs.\"</p><p>A 25 per cent tariff, up from 2.5 per cent now, would slash Germany's car imports to the US by as much as ???18.4 billion, according to Germany's ifo Institute, although the industry might be able to soften the blow through switching focus to other markets.</p><p>\"If these cars are viewed as a threat to US national security then we are alarmed,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last weekend.</p><p>American car makers will also be worried, as retaliatory European tariffs will hit the one-fifth of US car exports that are destined for Europe. As always, a trade war is unlikely to have any winners.</p><p>So let's tot it up. Trade tensions. Politically unpopular factory closures. Regulatory uncertainty, and increasing regulatory stringency. Rapidly changing technology, and nobody sure which technologies will prevail. Consumers' mercurial and evolving tastes, which may change in response to shifts in taxes, subsidies or technology. The path ahead looks perilous and potholed.</p><p>Still, at least the carmakers can take comfort that the traditional car market they know and love hasn't disappeared into the rear-view mirror just yet. For proof, look at James May: sure, he runs about in that new BMW i3 - much to Jeremy Clarkson's disgust, no doubt - but not always, as he revealed a year after buying it.</p><p>\"I'm in north Oxfordshire at the moment and I wanted to bring [my electric car] with me, but I realised that it was slightly too far to go, there and back. There isn't anywhere here to charge it, and in the end I had to come in my Porsche,\" he said. \"It was too wet for the Ferrari, unfortunately.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1030144483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGG-89W1-DY19-C446-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1520\"/><timeReceived>10:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Thank you for joining us. Welcome to Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. My name is Denis McDonough, a visiting Senior Fellow here at Carnegie. It's my distinct honor and great privilege to introduce to you the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister of our valued ally, the Netherlands. </p><p>Minister Ollengren has been in this position of Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister since October of 2017. Just had two days of intensive meetings here, yesterday with our government colleagues including DHS to talk about these matters. But this morning here with us and several representatives of leading tech firms to discuss their view of this enormous challenge. </p><p>I come to this issue, not only with intense personal interest, but with a hardened experience at the front row, with a front row view of the last incident of significant Russian intervention in our elections in the 2016 elections. </p><p>So, it's with great enthusiasm that we were asked to host the Minister on her visit for this part of here visit. So, it's a great honor to have everyone here. We look very much forward to your remarks, Madam Minister. We look forward to the discussion afterwards. So, without further ado, the Deputy Prime Minister, Interior Minister of the Netherlands. Ma'am, over to you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>OLLENGREN: Thank you, morning. Good morning everyone. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to lay the foundations upon which the statesmen of Western democracies may stand and to create an atmosphere favorable to the decisions to which they may be led.  </p><p>Well, you might think that would be quite an ambitious task for today, but luckily, it isn't our task, because these are not my words, but Churchill. Churchill, he said this, in 1984 the Congress of Europe, he was, of course, one of the most important founders of Europe. </p><p>And his primary objective back then in 1948, was to make it clear that the key issue was cooperation. Following the catastrophe that was World War II, what was needed more than anything was the willingness to work together because in the trenches and the face of the shell fire and the first World War, afterwards in the concentration camps and the bombed out cities, in the gulags, and while hueing for food, men and women dreamed of an undivided and free Europe. </p><p>And thanks to the sacrifice of American young men, boys, 18, 19 years old, on the beaches of Normandy, and thanks to the Martial Aid that's followed the war. Let's free Europe became a reality. And thanks to people like Winston Churchill, who through their strength, showed us the signs of hope an undivided Europe arose around us. </p><p>However, this European project, it's never complete. It's always in this state of flex. Cooperation in Europe is remarkable for its ambitions and also for its perseverance. It's a task that requires our constant attention. It requires hard work. It's a form of cooperation, that for many people, it's sort of a constant source of surprise, and sometimes even admiration. </p><p>How could it be that a group of countries, once so torn apart by war, cooperates so closely? How is it possible that countries are willing to give up their own currencies for a new single currency? How is it possible for a group of countries to voluntarily surrender part of their national sovereignty, because that's what we've done in Europe? </p><p>It's been done with a remarkable speed. Europe has rebuilt itself and has became one of the worlds largest trading partnerships in the market with 500 million consumers.  </p><p>Nonetheless, the foundations on which Churchill referred are not purely economical. They do go deeper than that and they should. As a consequence of that devastating war, and regimes of terror, we understand, perhaps, better than anyone, what it means to be robbed of the most elementary fundamental of rights and basic human dignities.  </p><p>So, in response, over the last 70 years, we have joined Churchill's instating that the fundamental rights of every citizen in Europe must be protected. And that's not self-evidence. It demands constant effort, certainly, in the current era, in which internal and external forces are threatening democracy and its intrinsic values.  </p><p>We are faced with the major challenge of upholding those values in the modern digital domain. So, let me give you a couple of examples. Last May, the European General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, was introduced. It's the aim of Europe, even in the digital world to continue to protect the privacy of Europeans fundamental rights of which the founders of Europe, in their age of telegrams of fixed telephones were probably not even aware. </p><p>We don't only want to take the lead in guaranteeing privacy in the digital domain, we also hope to take the lead in countering cyber threats and dis-information. Two phenomena that clearly threaten the confidence in fair and free elections. </p><p>Recent examples have made that abundantly clear. During the referendum about Brexit in the U.K., people went to the polling station with a pen because they were afraid that if they used a pencil, the mark would be rubbed out. And if they did use a pencil, the message was, you should press hard. That is worrying. </p><p>And last year we saw elections in Italy, great deal of fake news was spread by a social media. Politicians were accused of nepotism at the taxpayer's expense. And it all turned out to be incorrect. But it increased a distrust of citizens and politics. </p><p>And during the French--French Presidential elections, the then candidate, Macron, reported that his party's website were the targets of cyber-attacks. Though my visit to Washington DC, so far, has strengthened me in saying, the threats are real on both sides of the Atlantic. We need to step up our game.  </p><p>Protecting elections is the core task of a government, making sure that they're free and that they're fair. However, it happens at boundering line because as government, you wish to protect the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of debate. You don't want to sensor. You don't want to restrict that. Government is not an arbitrator of truth.   </p><p>So, our approach is two-fold. Firstly, we step up our efforts to make sure that technology operates in the interest of democracy. Representatives of the big tech companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter and others, they sign the EU code of conduct against dis-information. </p><p>And our view, self-regulation of this kind is meaningful and an important first step. By these companies and they're taking responsibility. And that's very important. I think we should continue to closely monitor these developers, but we need more transparency and engagement in the light of elections that are coming up in Europe, May, this year. </p><p>Secondly, we step up to strengthen the resilience of our democratic systems. And the Dutch Government is planning a campaign to raise awareness on media literacy. The campaign will pass no judgements on the truthfulness of content. It is, instead, up to citizens to decide for themselves to be critical. </p><p>Now, the reason I'm here, as I said, is that these problems are not exclusive to the European Union, to Europe. And that is why I'm so interested in understanding your views on these issues, and to hear and to learn from your approach. </p><p>So, we need to reach out across the Atlantic. We need scientific communities, civil societies, we need all of us to help, to tackle this issue. We, representatives of a shared history, a history that stretches from Essence to Amsterdam and Washington DC. We share a civilization. That unity of values and desires presents us with new tasks and with new challenges. </p><p>And the values of that civilization are universal and they're unique. And that, in a way that they permeate our history and our solidarity with each other. The central lesson of that past is that, if Europe and America are divided, the outcome is generally tragic.  </p><p>But if we stand together, then we can overcome any calamity. And perhaps, today, we could again succeed in laying foundations upon which, as Churchill said, Western democracies may stand, but this time, with the digital age. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>KELLY: Being here, I'd like to express my gratitude as well for Carnegie, for inviting the Cipher Brief to come and moderate. My name is Suzanne Kelly. I'm the CEO and publisher of the Cipher Brief. And we are going to have to make a slight change to the agenda today. The Deputy Minister must leave a little bit early, so we're going to wrap up the conversation around noon, but I would like to encourage a few questions. </p><p>So, to facilitate that, I'm going to go ahead and give everybody an opportunity to--I'm going to introduce you, an opportunity to answer a couple of questions and then we'll let the audience get in a few if that's alright with everyone. </p><p>So, welcome, thank you very much Madam Deputy Prime Minister. Is that correct? </p><p>OLLENGREN: Absolutely. </p><p>KELLY: Okay, well, thank you very much for those opening comments. I think it's important to focus in on what you talked about with anti-fake news. And I want to get to that in just one quick moment. I'd also like to welcome Matthew Travis. He is the first Deputy Director for DHSs Cybersecurity, and Infrastructure Security Agency. </p><p>And also, Mr. Thomas Rid who is Professor of Strategic Studies, just up the street at John's Hopkins. It's a pleasure to meet you and thank you for being here. </p><p>So, let me--let me waste no time in getting right to this. You mentioned how important the anti-fake news is. We've heard from our own intelligence community leaders just two weeks ago about how--how serious this threat is.  </p><p>You launched a campaign of your own in trying to take on fake news. Tell us a little bit about what you learned from that experience and the valuable take-aways. </p><p>OLLENGREN: Well, it's too soon to tell because we're just starting it. We have elections in March, and we have the European elections in May. And this campaign, it's about--it's about awareness, media literacy. I mean, we're teaching our kids that in schools. But this is about our democracy. </p><p>So, we need to reach out to everybody. All the target groups. We know, for instance, that older people are especially vulnerable in this respect that they are, they're not used to it. So, they're an easy trap for--for fake news and disinformation. </p><p>So, really reaching out to everybody, making aware this is happening. The Netherlands is a relatively a small country, but also a very open country. And that we have not seen the amount that some other countries have seen in Eastern Europe, for instance. We shouldn't be naive. It can happen to us. And I want to be there before the elections and not afterwards, when it's too late.  </p><p>KELLY: The typical conversation as well, to think through kind of what the components of that anti-fake news campaign need to include because you would like to very much say that everyone in society would be as interested as the people in this room in terms of making sure that they're educated, they're asking the right questions, they're getting the right information, they're filtering out the bad. But much, much harder as you say in actual reality. </p><p>Tell us a little bit, not about DHSs stance on this. And how you're trying to attack the issue of, not only fake news, but--but really insuring more resiliency in the--in the election process. </p><p>TRAVIS: Sure, great to be here today. </p><p>KELLY: Very small question. </p><p>TRAVIS: And thank you to Carnegie and Denis for the invitation. You know, when we look at this, we--we see it really as a two-fold problem. There is the attempts to undermine the election infrastructure, the technical manipulation of votes, compromising of election machines, voter registration roles, website of candidates and campaigns. </p><p>And that is a--kind of a physical protection problem set. But closely related that is what I call the information tax on the electorate, which gets to the mis-information and dis-information. So, within homeland security, we organize internally with two discrete teams to deal with both of those. </p><p>And our role, really, is not as the Deputy Prime minister said, and we have the same sensibility. We don't want to be the arbiters of truth. That is not the role for DHS. But what, we serve, I think in a unique position in government, our convening authority to bring in those 16 sectors of critical infrastructure, one of which is the election infrastructure industry, but also our relationships with state, local, tribal, territorial jurisdictions. </p><p>And so, being able to provide one information sharing on what we're seeing, what we can downgrade an intelligence information from the community and share it, or we can provide capacity building resources like training where we can do, on the physical side, scan networks, provide technical assistance on how secure are their networks, and even work with them to get a better sense of what's running on their networks. </p><p>And so, I think, you know, the election security challenge is not like the campaigns themselves where they come to an end and everyone exhales. We--the race continues. And candidates as you see on the news are already declared. So, we are--we are back and were still at it and--and while the mid-terms, you know, we're relatively pleased with how everything turned out. I think 2020 for us will be much more intensive given it's a Presidential election. </p><p>KELLY: Professor, you've written a number of books as well. And you've done a lot of writing on this particular issue. What do you think is missing from the national or international dialogue on how we're understanding and framing the issue? </p><p>RID: One--I think one observation just kind of misunderstanding is that dis-information invents fake news. That-that fake news is basically making up stuff. That's not really how historically dis-information and active measures, the term of art, have worked. </p><p>They work by sensing existing cleavages existing conflicts, existing conspiracies here, is for example. And then--and then pouring fuel into that fire, just making them worse. So, for example, one of the most famous examples is the AIDS theory. The theory that AIDS is an American design bio weapon built in Fort Detrick, Maryland. This is a hoax, obviously. </p><p>But the hoax existed in the early 1980s already in the activist circles. And the Soviets and Stasi together lifted it out of that corner and gave it more visibility. And then, of course, it stopped at some point in 1980--1987 and the myth continued. So, Kanye West in one his lyrics a song called, \"Heard Em Say\", uses that line in 2005. Is that because of the Soviet operation? We don't know. </p><p>The fact that these operations are using existing prejudices and conspiracy theories, makes them extremely hard to measure, even if you have a lot of data.  </p><p>KELLY: I--and obviously, right. The influence level is extremely difficult to measure. We talked a little bit about information security and sharing information. Sharing information not only with the public, if you're talking about kind of anti-fake news, but also with each other as you prepare for elections. What were some of the key lessons learned that you feel like, Madam Minister, you can share from the last election? And preparations for the upcoming in May. </p><p>OLLENGREN: Yes, we're--we're--we're preparing for the upcoming. And I think it's--as you said, I mean, it's not--it's not a new phenomenon, but what is new is that it's now happening in the digital age with the social media. </p><p>And that has--that--that has made it a completely different ball game altogether. And I think we're now at the stage like you here in the U.S. with the--where you had an election that proved at least that was a reason for you to step up your efforts. And then you saw the mid-terms. And then you have been able to--to--to kind of were able to take away some of it. </p><p>And that is--I think we're in the same situation in Europe. We have had some elections and referendums where we know that this played a role. We cannot prove that it has actually affected the outcome. That's very difficult to prove. But we--so the awareness is much higher. And that's the reason that the European commission has made the action plan. That's the reason we have the code of conduct. That's the reason that we're talking to the tech companies and working together with the tech companies and with Academia. </p><p>And that's a big difference to two, three years ago. And for myself, also, when I first talked to the tech companies, most of them are American, of course, but stationed in Europe. And then their attitudes was a little bit, you know, searching for what can we do? What can you ask from us? What can you not ask from us? </p><p>But now their attitude is different. Now they're--because that's also affecting their credibility. So, I think that's a big change. It's a big step. But I'm sure we're not there yet. And then again, we don't know what is developing also in the field of technology. </p><p>KELLY: Seeing more cooperation--. </p><p>OLLENGREN: --Yes--. </p><p>KELLY: --which you think is a good thing--. </p><p>OLLENGREN: --Absolutely--. </p><p>KELLY: --and turn them in the right direction. </p><p>OLLENGREN: Yep. </p><p>KELLY: Let's talk about the upcoming election in 2020 because we heard Dan Coats just recently testify before the Senate that the adversaries are still out there. They're still looking to influence the election. What are you seeing? And what lessons might you be able to share from what you're seeing now? </p><p>TRAVIS: Let me start with the lessons that we drew from 2018. And I think for us it was--there were a couple of things that stand out. One, we really doubled down the investment of the partnerships with the--with the platforms.  </p><p>So, the Silicon Valley companies, we engaged last Spring, went out there and met with them. And to their credits, they made the investments. They--they made the decisions to treat this as the high priority that they did. And that made a real difference because they had--we had willing partners who were not only with us throughout the campaign with whom we could share information.  </p><p>With them we got a better sense of how they were attacking the problem form their end. But up until election night, when we had representatives of Twitter and Google and Facebook and Microsoft with us, either in the room or on the screen. So, that when there was some anomalies that we saw in terms of mis-information and dis-information, we could work with them. </p><p>And again, it's their role to decide what to do with that information. So, investing in those partnerships, and also, I think we--we spent a lot of time getting the media familiar with the problem set of what--how elections work, where the security risks are. </p><p>We held a table top exercise--a nationwide table top exercise where we brought the media in. So, I think, helping them to understand, again, there's tax on the election infrastructure, and then there's the information tax. Both obviously can undermine democracy. But we treat one each differently. </p><p>And I think those partnerships are what it have--have's us positioned well going into 2020. But again, as I said, I think just given the intensity and attention that Presidential elections get, I think that---that will be the--a much more pronounced effort on all fronts. </p><p>KELLY: And then also, I think an interesting question, and Professor, perhaps you can speak to this is, where--as this is an evolving process. And as you mentioned, social media's such a fast moving way to get information out there. And it's very difficult to ever bring it back once it's out. </p><p>What do you see as potential solutions to this long term? I mean, I've probably given you the hardest question up here today. But, for someone who studies it and who's seen the patterns and whose written books about this. </p><p>RID: Yeah. </p><p>KELLY: What do you see as a way for it to help? </p><p>RID: So, we've seen a number of companies as well as U.S. Government take a number of steps that are very positive and will probably make a difference, even if the difference is hard to spot because nothing happens. Success means nothing happens. </p><p>KELLY: Tough to measure. </p><p>RID: It's a bit of a difficult one to also measure. But Twitter, for example, has published it's--a lot of data from the Saint Petersburg Troll Farm, more than 10 million--around 10 million tweets. That's an extremely rich data set to work with.  </p><p>So, let me just cheese out one finding. We saw in 2016 that the internet research agency amplified existing fissures and conflicts within the U.S. I would, absolutely, expect something similar to happen in 2020, and I'll say what probably, a lot of the people in the room are thinking, may not want to touch. One of the biggest vulnerabilities going into 2020, is President Trump's heated--President Trump repeatedly calling into question the legitimacy of the election itself. </p><p>Now, that is fodder for any of this information campaign because they will suddenly try to amplify that message, calling into question whether, you know, the outcome of the vote is legitimate, or not, that is ultimately.  Also, a Russian goal and then here, I think we are facing an important, we, as pundits, journalists, experts, government officials, we're facing a very difficult evidential problem because any disinformation campaign that will tap into what will happen 2020, will most likely, be miniscule in effect in comparison to the (INAUDIBLE) political currents and developments. </p><p>So, when you risk exaggerating the effect of this information, we basically risk building up Russia into an adversary that is, that looks stronger and more powerful than they really are. </p><p>KELLY: So, it seems very simple to say something like this. But do we need to be looking to candidates, as well, putting responsibility on them to not be generating information that may not be 100 percent true, that may not be something that you can prove or. Do candidates need to take more responsibility in making sure the information that they're putting out is accurate? </p><p>RID: Like me to respond to that? </p><p>KELLY: That's a very difficult question because, now, we're talking politics, right? Yes, sure. I'd like all of you to respond to that, actually. </p><p>TRAVIS: We like candidates to make sure that they're practicing strong cyber hygiene measures, that their password regimes and their networks are scanned. And we, you know, we need to stand by DHS when we did throughout the 2018 cycle work with the DNC, the RNC, individual campaigns to scan their networks, to do vulnerability assessments of their electronic infrastructure. </p><p>So, that's where we take the security angle. I don't have any opinion on the question. </p><p>KELLY: I think that's a very, very simple answer from DHS, 100 percent </p><p>RID: I would just say this. The, given the history of statements that, and I'm sorry, this is a political thing to say but it has to be said. Given the past, the history of statements from Donald Trump, on the legitimacy of outcomes of election, you know, the systems rigged in 2016, but he continued along those lines. I think it is an important conversation to have among, among elected members of Congress, especially in the Senate, possibly among former Presidents of the United States, people who have the weight in a public discussion to step into a very fragile moment on election nights, on November 9, when possibly, the question comes up, are we dealing with a legitimate election, here, and what happened. </p><p>So, we need, in a situation like this, there are only a very few people who can de-escalate and create the perception of stability. And I think it is crucial to have this conversation ahead of time. And sure, it's happening already, but I think it's an important one to have.  </p><p>KELLY: You're looking at academics and you're looking media institutions to be able to weigh in on the impact of something, whether or not it's intentional or not, in terms of the message. There's an impact there. </p><p>RID: I think we're really looking at Senators and elected officials.  </p><p>KELLY: And how do you look at this from outside the U.S. and think what lessons are we seeing that we can take away? </p><p>OLLONGREN: Well, there are many lessons. First, perhaps, let me go into this issue, also, not of course, in the American situation but in the Netherlands. I think the principle of a democracy is that you have freedom of speech and the exchange of ideas. And so, politicians, any candidate should feel free to say whatever he or she wants to say and to present his or her truth, even if it's not true. Because that's political debate. </p><p>But if the system is working, then you have independent journalism that takes care of that, that can ask questions. You have the other politicians, the opponents, that will also take care of that issue. So, I think that's the kind of democracy that I feel very strongly about, that you can have this political debate. </p><p>What you don't want is influence that you don't really see what's coming from elsewhere. It has a different purpose, it's coming from other countries with the purpose to destabilize. I agree, completely, what was said just now. It's not--it's not just about being true or not true, fake or not fake. It's about destabilizing our society. </p><p>KELLY: That's an understanding that the adversaries have that opportunity. </p><p>OLLONGREN: Because we are an open society. We present with them with that opportunity because we want to be open society. </p><p>KELLY: Exactly right. </p><p>TRAVIS: And we'll just add to this that I do think there's a basic level of responsibility for the citizenry, to be a citizen of the United States. You know, read whatever you want but know what you're reading. And so, we had some, you know, some phrases, \"Think before you link.\" And people just scrolling down with no regard to the source of the information that they're reading.  </p><p>Now, that's not necessarily, being as a responsible citizen, I think we all need. And so, there, you know, this is a, you know, collective effort to make sure that democracy can still thrive. It's not just the government, it's not just the social media company, it's not just the candidates. It's the electorate, as well. </p><p>KELLY: Massive collective effort, which is why I think everybody realizes how incredibly difficult but important it is. Do we have questions from the audience? I'd like to share some of the time. Here. Do we have a microphone? Yeah, we do, it's coming. If I could just have you, kindly, tell us who you are and where you're from, that would be great. </p><p>QUESTION: I have a question for Professor Rid.  Rid, did I say that right? That is the idea which I have not heard before. And so, I'm, of having trusted voices speak on election night about the legitimacy of the results of the campaign. On one hand, that's a very appealing idea to me and on the other hand, I think about poor General Powell who went up before the United Nations and testified that there were weapons of mass destruction, after having been briefed by the intelligence communities that there were.  </p><p>So, I wonder how you can--what system could possibly reassure a Jimmy Carter and a George W. Bush that they were comfortable saying those things? </p><p>RID: I think you may be in a better position to answer that question. And me, I'll just say briefly, some of the work that has been done at DHS and elsewhere is creating visibility, if I'm understanding you and some of your colleagues correctly, into potential attacks, cyber-attacks against election infrastructure. </p><p>And of course, attack against the debates, public debates are visible by default. Sometimes, not openly visible but you can see them. So, it's not a problem that will appear in a fluff on election night. It is a problem that will slowly arise and then we'll see it. </p><p>TRAVIS: Yeah, I would just say that we see ourselves as trying to improve people's ability to make risk informed decisions. And so, everything we do is geared towards promoting and sharing information so that, whether it's the candidates, whether it's the parties, whether it's social media platforms or the public, that they can understand the threats and vulnerabilities into what they're --what they're reading, so. </p><p>I don't think I have an answer to your central question but that's all I'll say on that. </p><p>KELLY: Understanding the threat in a timely, I would think is equally as important because it kind of loses its effectiveness weeks later.  Question. </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you very much. What was the AmericaRussian service--thank you very much for being here, today. I think Netherlands were probably first, one of the first international victims of fake new with all this dozens of fake versions of shot down of MH17, five years ago. And my question is related to MH17. Did you discuss, did you discuss it, here, in the United States, maybe requesting some help or something else? What is the nature of talks of government of Netherlands with Russians because, now, we have statements, of a Russian foreign ministry confirming these talks, still denying any responsibility?   </p><p>Do you think that Russia is responsible for shooting down MH17 and what's the roadmap for bringing those who did it to justice? Thank you. </p><p>OLLONGREN: Those are lots of questions but very important questions. It's true that the, we have been affected by this information concerning the MH17 so, that was vulnerability in our society, this terrible disaster that happened. It has affected, also, our relationship with Russia, ever since. And it still does. </p><p>We have two tracks that are still ongoing and so, for the criminal law, there is an investigation team that has researched what has happened and it has found proof that there was a Russian buck, missile that shot it down. And so, the proof is there but the court hearings still have to happen. </p><p>And there is the international track. We are holding Russia responsible, together with, very young with another affected country. And in the context of that process there will be talks with Russia. And that is what you have been reading about. They are being prepared today. </p><p>And your question if it's been part of the discussions that I've had here, yes, because I' made 17 for instance, it's very--extremely important. We have always depended on the cooperation of the U.S. and still are. That is very important to us. There was one American citizen on board. But aside from that, the U.S. has always proven itself a very valuable partner. </p><p>And it's important for us to keep them up to date and to keep them involved. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi there. My name is Nicholas Turpstrom (PH), a student at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, studying here, interning at the Cato Institute. </p><p>I had a quick question for, perhaps, Mr. Rid and Mr. Travis. By and large, would you say that the things that we've been seeing are more undermining on social media, the elections, or more directed at candidate support, especially, say in 2016 and 2018. Which of the two types of quote, unquote, fake news are more popular? </p><p>RID: I think what we've seen in 2016, on certain kinds social media, disinformation campaigns and I'll make a, sort of, bold, big statement, here. We tend to overestimate the effect of these campaigns. The most effective component of the 2016 election interference was the hack and leak of, ultimately, John Podesta's Email via wiki leaks, not anything that happened on Twitter and Facebook. </p><p>So, while it is important to work with the data that we have, really have to be very cautious in assessing effects. You know, keep in mind the internet research agency in St. Petersburg was exposed by Russian domestic investigative journalists, four weeks after it was created, and it continued to be an ongoing story. It's a very unprofessionally run operation. </p><p>TRAVIS: I would just say that I think it's a mistake to think that the influence campaigns are only centered around elections. And in fact, what we see from bad actors is an attempt to, you know, whether it's sewing discord or, you know rabble rousing in any, any issue that is going to try to divide and polarize society.  </p><p>So, you see it throughout the year, unrelated to elections in terms of trying to win influence and make socially divisive issues ever more so. And that's, I think, the greater threat to the societies become more and more polarized than, you know, adding that element to try to accelerate that polarization is one I think we all need to be on the lookout for. </p><p>KELLY: That's a tool. That's a great point. Yes, sir, back to you now. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is Roger (INAUDIBLE), I work with private equity in the technology sector. And my question is a little bit more philosophical. Thirty years ago, when the law of the internet was first coming together, the basic principle was that a website operator was liable and responsible. The internet industry was liable and responsible for any content that they posted. And the comparison was that they were like a publisher. The newspaper is responsible for the letters to the editor that they publish, even though they didn't write them, and a newspaper is responsible for the op-ed articles that they publish, even though they didn't write them. </p><p>So, there was a chain of liability and responsibility. There was enormous pushback against that. And by the mid '90s, the basic legal structure was that internet providers were not responsible for the content. They were more like a telephone company which has no responsibility for the words that people speak over the phone or a post office that has no responsibility for the content of the letters that are mailed. </p><p>In the last ten years, we've seen a significant reversal of that, that's a very topical, very specific. Well, they're not, internet companies are not responsible for the content, but they are responsible for making sure that child predation content is not posted. They are responsible for making sure that human trafficking content is not posted. But if we go down the path of saying that internet companies are responsible for making sure that news is not posted by somebody who has nefarious intentions and lies from a country that I don't like, where does this stop? </p><p>I mean, why, why can't the people of Saudi Arabia say, you can't have content that's blasphemous or the people of Mississippi say you can't have content that's nudity. You know, where do we draw the line between responsibility to surveil and filter out stuff you don't want? </p><p>KELLY: Right, it's a great point. Sorry to cut you off. I'm being a little bit mindful of time, but I think your question is, whose responsibility, ultimately, is this monitor. We've struggled with this for quite a while. What are your thoughts on that and then, I'm going to have each of you give us some closing thoughts before we have to wrap up? </p><p>OLLONGREN: Okay, maybe the Professor, first on this issue because I think that's- </p><p>KELLY: --Right up your alley. </p><p>RID: Well, I'm not sure I have something really intelligent to say in response to this being sort of familiar, content management question. And instead, I'll use the opportunity to just briefly say something to Minister. I think the, I just wanted to make sure that you hear that the work and especially, the work that you've done there has been going, really over decades, in the field of exposing hostile operations via neutron bomb operation in 1979, comes to mind where your country was at the forefront of a major election and a major interference operation. </p><p>And of course, again, the work and the context as I mentioned to the team but also, exposing some of the GRU hacking operations more recently with, you know, pictures, you know. Very commendable and impressive work, so, well done. </p><p>OLLONGREN: Thank you. </p><p>KELLY: Alright, shall we, I think that's a great question. I think it's a big one to grasp. Do you have comments on, either of you, on that question? </p><p>TRAVIS: I think, for one, the Department of Homeland Security enthusiastically supports the first amendment. So, we have, absolutely, no interest in--and I appreciate the question itself.  I think if you look at the Mueller indictments on the Russian troll factory, those are developed foreign influence, right. So, we're talking about foreign speech trying to influence U.S. elections. </p><p>There are laws that, you know, prohibit that. That's an issue, there. The rest of it, I think is great issues to take up in academia and other public fora. </p><p>KELLY: Any final thoughts? </p><p>OLLONGREN: Lots of them. But I think we have to wrap up.   </p><p>KELLY: Yeah, what should we walk away with from this? </p><p>OLLONGREN: Yes, what should we walk--I think to step up our efforts to work together. I was very inspired by visiting DHS, yesterday. It was very inspiring. I think some, we're doing already in the Netherlands, but I think we have to do more of it. And I also, I want to leave you with the concern that we have, free speech is the essence of everything. </p><p>And so, we always have to respect that and, if you have that as your fundamental position, then all the other things you can do in a coordinated and cooperative manner. I mean, we need each other. Not only the tech and the platforms, mostly American companies. But as I've been talking to them, I understand, also, that they have more--they're trying to understand our culture in Europe and our way of dealing with these issues. </p><p>And also, we understand that you're one country and Europe is 28 countries, 27 in a couple of weeks' time. And they're all different. They have diverse and different cultures, different judicious, different histories, with Russia, for instance. So, we have to keep all of that in mind but still find ways to work together. </p><p>TRAVIS: As the phrase was in the Navy, that when you're driving the ships, vigilance is the eternal price for safety. I think vigilance is the eternal price for democracy. I think it's incumbent upon all of us to understand what we're reading, where it's coming from and this notion of a collective effort from the social media platforms, from government, from the citizenry, there are placed to go to find out where this is coming from.  </p><p>The Atlantic Council, The Alliance for Securing Democracy, do great work, publicly available on showing. And not from the government on where some of these global ne'er do wells are what they're putting out there. And I think the message that we have from DHS is, we want to continue to work with all partners from the states, from the localities, from the technology companies but also, the citizens need to be more vigilant. </p><p>KELLY: And that's one of DHS's biggest challenges, is the education component, too, right.  Professor, any final thoughts? </p><p>RID: No, I think we've had enough fun. </p><p>KELLY: Well, I'd like to thank each of you, again.

But it just doesn't work.\" As to her own style, Carnegie has raised a few eyebrows in the terribly staid, mostly proper and male-dominated world of banking by occasionally padding around the office in bare feet.</p><p>She's amused that, in her nine months or so at ANZ, this is one of the stories that has evidently piqued a certain level of interest, acknowledging that her approach to leadership is \"slightly different\" to her colleagues.</p><p>\"I tend to call a spade a shovel,\" she says. \"I understand at some level that I need to dress like a banker so I will metaphorically put the grey flannel suit on, but at my core I'm a girl from North Epping (in Sydney's northwest) whose parents are teachers.</p><p>\"At the end of the day I don't take myself too seriously, just like Shayne, who is introducing a more humble and curious culture. But I don't take my shoes off assuming it will drive cultural change!\" If there's a single deal that's emblematic of ANZ's approach to the digital age, it's the partnership with the Apple Pay digital wallet struck in April last year.</p><p>It's emblematic because it involves an acceptance by ANZ that collaboration is the best model to give customers what they actually want.</p><p>It might be a perception of -superior functionality, or it might just come down to the Apple brand, but whatever it is ANZ had to confront the reality that it doesn't always have the answers.</p><p>The contrast with the three other major banks could not be more stark. In July, they pitched the competition regulator for an exemption to collectively negotiate access to the near-field communications antenna on the iPhone so they could provide their own digital wallets without relying on Apple Pay for payments processing. The ACCC kyboshed those hopes in its final ruling, announced yesterday.</p><p>Carnegie accepts you can \"absolutely make the argument\" that Apple should open up its infrastructure and collaborate with the banks.</p><p>\"But the right lens to look through in this kind of issue is what the customer wants,\" she says.</p><p>\"You have to have the humility to say: 'We have a digital wallet and the customers should want ours more, but they just don't'.\" For Carnegie, Apple Pay represents a digital demarcation line that separates the institutions that are destined to win in the 21st century. She argues that the accelerating pace of change means that open systems will triumph over closed systems \"every single day\", and tweeted as much earlier this month.</p><p>\"For any single institution in the world to honestly believe they're going to be able to meet the needs of their customers at the pace of change that we're only just starting to see is ludicrous,\" Car-negie says.</p><p>\"So I will always back an open system, but that requires a degree of maturity on both sides, including the banks, because we'll be collaborating with people one day and turning around and competing against them the next.</p><p>\"The fact that our customers love Apple Pay doesn't mean we will never work again on our own digital wallet.\" It begs the question: what happens to the banks that refuse to collaborate; where the impulse to own and control everything that comes into their orbit is irresistible?</p><p>Maybe they just disappear inside an app, or wither away.</p><p>Carnegie makes the point that even Amazon is opening physical branches, and has been mentioned in connection with a possible takeover of the incumbent US bank Capital One.</p><p>\"But your point is a valid one - the future for a bank that doesn't make the transition is not a happy one,\" she says.</p><p>\"That said, there are parts of banking that are very technically difficult, such as credit risk and regulator management, and the big tech companies don't want to do that.</p><p>\"Some banks might think they don't need to own the customer relationship.\"Clearly, ANZ is not one of them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20170401Australian28000245894878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6T-7XY1-F0JP-W4XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1166\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 1, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001V19</classCode><className>NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Carr said his push for \"light-touch regulation\" represents a growing shift among conservatives, and existing conservative Washington think tanks are dominated by \"abject corporatism\" and opposition to all regulation. \"My approach to net neutrality is consistent with my approach to big tech,\" Carr said. \"It's easy to say 'let's not change anything,'\" Carr said. \"This is not simply competition in a free market; this is taking advantage of a landscape skewed by law to favor their business model.\"</p><p>Carr's calls for regulation of large tech companies are different from those of Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., because he's not looking for drastic moves such as breaking them up, he said. The Ajit Pai FCC took the light-touch path on net neutrality rules for ISPs by incorporating FTC enforcement and transparency requirements, Carr said. \"We need to be leaning on transparency to get the result we want.\" Carr said he would like users to have control over whether their feeds are fact-checked.</p><p>Big tech is \"unique\" in terms of the power it currently wields without accompanying regulation, Carr said. \"There's nothing like it in terms of the power it holds over our daily lives.\" The regulations he's proposing won't harm U.S. tech companies much or lead to domination of the space by Chinese tech companies, he said. If tech companies are going to have the benefits of the special liability protections Section 230 provides them, they should be held accountable, he said.</p><p>Carr said the goal of reform proposals isn't to neutralize online platforms politically or aid one side's voices. He rejected comparisons of the 230 proposal to FCC content rules that conservatives have traditionally opposed. \"The analogy between fairness doctrine and 230 is not an apt one,\" Carr said: Additional transparency rules would aid platforms like Twitter because they would remove the \"black box\" around company actions seen by some as rooted in political bias.</p><p>The rhetoric on the Section 230 proposal is \"overblown,\" Carr said. He said the changes wouldn't affect platforms' ability to act against online calls to violence or obscenity but would focus on political speech. He said the FCC has the authority to pursue the proposal, though he conceded several times the going would be difficult. \"I understand there are challenges,\" he said. \"We can hold these platforms more accountable.\"</p><p>Carr said the support for the proposed rule changes exceeded his expectations, noting backing from AT&amp;T and legislators such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The docket has gotten 7,000 comments, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WS-NVK1-DYRJ-01WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 17, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Carr criticized the board in a series of tweets, calling it Facebook \"speech police\" and arguing most members have left-leaning bias. Facebook and several board members didn't comment Tuesday.</p><p>Some industry experts and observers agreed in other interviews with some of Carr's points. The commissioner has taken heat in the recent weeks over his focus on China and other issues that some argue are outside his agency's purview (see 2004240045). Others argued Facebook should be more active in moderating to stop the spread of hate content, which has been rampant on filterless platforms like 4chan. Some noted the FCC has no jurisdiction over speech on social media platforms, a point that Carr addressed in Monday's interview.</p><p>Carr warned against biased and fallible participants making content moderation decisions, particularly about political speech. He urged Facebook to get \"out of the speech police business altogether.\" He suggested the company turn off its \"bias filters,\" giving users the option to have unfiltered feeds.</p><p>\"Unless you want Facebook to turn into 4chan, setting and enforcing reasonable limits is appropriate,\" said Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro. \"So the oversight board is a good move because it establishes an independent and transparent process to start adjudicating decisions and upholding values like free speech.\" The board appears to be \"a diverse and thoughtful group of people\" structured to operate with independence, he said.</p><p>It's unclear why Carr is spending time on this issue because there's no FCC jurisdiction, said Free Press co-CEO Jessica Gonzalez. It's critical for Facebook to moderate its platform to prevent the spread of hate groups and white supremacists, she said: The company has a responsibility to protect users from abuse, and it hasn't done a good enough job so far. It's unclear whether the panel will help, but she said she doesn't want to \"trash it\" yet.</p><p>Carr acknowledged the jurisdiction-related pushback. \"I don't envision a regulatory role for the FCC,\" he said, noting it's not an issue he has raised with Chairman Ajit Pai or other commissioners. He intended to highlight the selections Facebook made, he said.</p><p>The content moderation approach, whether done under the umbrella of Facebook or the company operating through a so-called supreme court, is a \"fraught no-win path,\" Carr said. \"It's pretty plain that they've stood this board up as a way to sort of pass the buck and say, 'Hey, it's not us. It's this oversight board.' You really can't have it both ways.\"</p><p>Gun safety advocate Andy Parker, a frequent critic of big tech and its use of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (see 2002200049), agreed Facebook created this body to improve its reputation. It's \"purely cosmetic,\" and nothing is going to happen until Congress amends or revokes Section 230, he said.</p><p>The board could be a useful adjunct to Facebook's own obligations, but Section 230 is really the issue, said Excolo Law's Keith Altman: Child pornography doesn't proliferate on Facebook because the platform is held accountable for such content. The company should face the same accountability for terror-related content, he argued.</p><p>The platform should focus less on human intervention and more on technology for locating harmful content, said Coalition for a Safer Web Vice President-Content Moderation Eric Feinberg. Now, he said, the tech player is relying on a reactionary, whack-a-mole approach. He said that means a lot of material slips through in foreign languages.</p><p>Twenty members are on the oversight board, originating from the U.S., Australia, Cameroon, France, Israel, the U.K., Kenya, Brazil, Denmark, Hungary, Colombia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Pakistan, Senegal, India and Yemen. The U.S. members (see personals section, May 7) are co-Chair Michael McConnell, Stanford Law School; Evelyn Aswad, University of Oklahoma College of Law; Jamal Greene, Columbia Law School; Pamela Karlan, Stanford Law School; and John Samples, Cato Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX4-X531-JC8G-82HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 13, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This isn't a radical new idea: It's how society treats cars and driving.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the Ford Model T, the first mass-produced and mass-consumed automobile. Its debut in 1908 launched the automobile age, a time of great mobility 6 and widespread death. Car crashes (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/\">https://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/</url>) kill more than a million people worldwide each year  6 but the fatality rate per mile driven (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_safety_in_the_United_States\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_safety_in_the_United_States</url>) has been dropping  almost since the first Model T rolled off the assembly line.</p><p>The reason for that improving safety record is not that people learning to drive studied the ethics of responsible and safe driving. Rather, they were taught, and tested on, the rules of the road, in order to obtain a driving license. Other regulations (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/standards.cfm\">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/standards.cfm</url>) improved how roads were built , required car makers to adopt (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/10/16/449090584/why-arent-auto-safety-standards-universal\">https://www.npr.org/2015/10/16/449090584/why-arent-auto-safety-standards-universal</url>) new safety features , mandated (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance/\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance/</url>) accident (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance/\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance/</url>) insurance , and o(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/impaired-driving\">https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/impaired-driving</url>) utlawed drunk driving  and (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texting_while_driving\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texting_while_driving</url>) other unsafe behaviors. I believe a similar approach 6 regulation, in addition to ethics education for technologists, as well as market competition 6 is needed today to make modern technology safe for society as a whole.</p><p>Flaws in the basic business model</p><p>In the 1980s, internet pioneers adopted a philosophy that \"(<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free</url>) information wants to be free \" 6 so website owners didn't charge readers for access to the content. Instead, internet companies used advertising to support their efforts. That led them to collect personal data on their users and offer micro-targeted advertising to make money, which social scientist Shoshana Zuboff calls \"(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/\">https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/</url>) surveillance capitalism .\"</p><p>This business model is (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue\">https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue</url>) enormously profitable , so it's unlikely internet companies will abandon it on their own as a result of ethical qualms.

It is unreasonable to expect for-profit corporations to avoid profitable businesses that are legal. In my view, it is not enough to simply criticize internet companies' ethics. If society finds the surveillance business model offensive, then the remedy is not an ethical outrage, but making laws and regulations that govern it, or even prevent it altogether.</p><p>Of course, public policy cannot be divorced from ethics. Selling human organs (<url normalizedValue=\"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00007890-201709000-00016\">https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00007890-201709000-00016</url>) is banned in the U.S . in part because society finds it ethically repugnant to profit from life itself. But the ban is enforced by laws, not by an ongoing ethics debate.

There is a massive rush to hirechief ethics officers[5], retoolcodes of professional ethics[6]andteach ethics to students[7]. But as ascholar of computing[8]- and a teacher ofa course on computing[9], ethics and society at Rice University - I am skeptical of the assumptions that what ails technology is a lack of ethics, and that the best fix is to teach technologists about ethics. Instead, in my view, the solution is government action, which aims at balancing regulation, ethics and markets. This isn't a radical new idea: It's how society treats cars and driving. Consider, for instance, the Ford Model T, the first mass-produced and mass-consumed automobile. </p><p>Its debut in 1908 launched the automobile age, a time of great mobility - and widespread death. Car crashes killmore than a million people worldwide each year[10]- but the fatality rate per mile drivenhas been dropping[11]almost since the first Model T rolled off the assembly line. Chart: The Conversation, CC-BY-ND Source: U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Administration Photo: The Conversation The reason for that improving safety record is not that people learning to drive studied the ethics of responsible and safe driving. Rather, they were taught, and tested on, the rules of the road, in order to obtain a driving license. Other regulationsimproved how roads were built[12], required car makers to adoptnew safety features[13], mandatedaccident[14] insurance[15], andoutlawed drunk driving[16]andother unsafe behaviors.[17] I believe a similar approach - regulation, in addition to ethics education for technologists, as well as market competition - is needed today to make modern technology safe for society as a whole. Flaws in the basic business model In the 1980s, internet pioneers adopted a philosophy that 'information wants to be free[18]' - so website owners didn't charge readers for access to the content. Instead, internet companies used advertising to support their efforts. That led them to collect personal data on their users and offermicro-targeted advertisingto make money, which social scientist Shoshana Zuboff calls 'surveillance capitalism[19].' This business model isenormously profitable[20], so it's unlikely internet companies will abandon it on their own as a result of ethical qualms. Even in the face ofblistering critiques[21]andFacebook's Cambridge Analytica[22]scandal, the massive profits are compelling. Chart: The Conversation, CC-BY-ND Source: MacroTrends Photo: The Conversation The real problem with surveillance capitalism is not that it is unethical - which I believe it is - but that it is completely legal in most countries. It is unreasonable to expect for-profit corporations to avoid profitable businesses that are legal. In my view, it is not enough to simply criticize internet companies' ethics. If society finds the surveillance business model offensive, then the remedy is not an ethical outrage, but making laws and regulations that govern it, or even prevent it altogether. Of course, public policy cannot be divorced from ethics. Selling human organsis banned in the U.S[23].in part because society finds it ethically repugnant to profit from life itself. But the ban is enforced by laws, not by an ongoing ethics debate. As Chief Justice Earl Warren remarked: 'In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics[24].' Regulation has benefits For decades, the information-technology industry hassuccessfully lobbieda[25]gainst attempts to legislate or regulate it, arguing that 'regulation stifles innovation[26].' Of course, that assumes all innovation is good. It has become evidently clear that this is not always the case: Some of the internet giants'innovation has harmed democratic society[27]in the U.S. and around the world.

Photo: Jan Hetfleisch/Getty Images In fact, one purpose of regulation is to chill certain kinds of innovation - specifically, those that the public finds wrong, distasteful or unhelpful to the advancement of society. Regulation can also encourage innovation in ways society deems beneficial. There is no question that regulations on the automobile industry encouraged innovation insafety[28]andfuel efficiency[29]. Some members of Congress have proposed a number ofambitious[30] plans[31]to tackleinformation warfare[32],consumer protection,competition in digital technologyand therole of artificial intelligencein society. But much simpler - and more widely supported - rules could make a huge difference for individual customers and society as a whole. For instance, federal regulators could require software terms and licenses include plain language that's easily understood by anyone - perhaps modeled on the longstanding 'plain English rule[33]' for corporate financial filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Laws or rules could also require companies todisclose data breaches[34] quickly, both to officials and the public at large. That might even spark innovation as firms increase their efforts to prevent and detect network intrusions and data theft. Another relatively easy opportunity would be to regulate automated judicial decision systems, including requiring that they not be deployed before passing an independent audit showing that they arefair and unbiased[35]. Those straightforward regulations could pave the way for thinking and talking about whether and how to regulatethe sizes of these big technology firms[36]. But rule-making need not start with the hardest problems - there's plenty to do that most people would agree on right away. The bottom line is that technology advances have been movingvery fast[37], while public policy has lagged behind. It is time for public policy to catch up with technology. If technology is driving the future, society should do the steering. Moshe Y. Vardi[38] is a professor of Computer Science, Rice University.

My hours vary each week working in retail and while I am not always travelling in peak hour, I still do not want to be taking public transport if I can avoid it,\" she said.</p><p>\"I think a lot of people would still prefer to drive, so Carly is one way you can do it without the long-term financial commitment or worry about hidden costs, as everything like rego, insurance, maintenance and road assistance is all included. It makes managing a budget easy.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9.45am: </emphasis>               EY, FinTech Australia announce tie-up            </p><p>Ernst &amp; Young Australia (EY) says it has inked a collaboration agreement with FinTech Australia, which it says will enable further involvement in future fintech events, awards and studies into the ecosystem.</p><p>EY FinTech advisor Meredith Angwin said the agreement extends and broadens the firm's involvement with FinTech Australia, expanding on its current role as the key research firm behind the annual Australian Fintech Census. </p><p>\"EY has been a long-term supporter of FinTech Australia, from our collaboration on the EY FinTech Australia Census for the past four years - which has provided important insights into the development of the sector - to our involvement with the annual Intersekt Festival and other key initiatives.\"            </p><p>FinTech Australia CEO Rebecca Schot-Guppy said: \"Today's announcement not only confirms EY's commitment to the Australian fintech ecosystem, but deepens it.\" \"The FinTech Census, created alongside EY, serves as a key piece of annual research that helps us better communicate the needs of the ecosystem to policy makers and corporate stakeholders. We look forward to working more closely with EY to find other new and innovative ways to support the fintech ecosystem.\" </p><p>Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.45am: </emphasis>               TikTok, US look to avoid sale            </p><p> TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, is discussing with the US government possible arrangements that would allow the popular video-sharing app to avoid a full sale of its US operations, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Discussions around such an option, under way for months, have assumed increased urgency since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale more difficult, the people said. They take place against a fast-approaching deadline that President Trump imposed for TikTok to agree to a sale of its US operations or else be shut down, and as geopolitical wrangling over the app intensifies.</p><p/><p>A number of options remain on the table, the situation is fluid and a sale is still a possibility, the people said. Even if there isn't a full sale, the outcome would likely involve some sort of restructuring of TikTok, one of the people said.</p><p>The main concern for government officials involved in the talks has been the security of TikTok's data and keeping it out of reach of the Chinese government, said people familiar with the negotiations.</p><p>Mr Trump has said repeatedly that he wants an American company to buy the operations, and it isn't clear whether any alternative would satisfy his concerns. Where China stands is also a mystery.</p><p>Treasury Department spokeswoman Monica Crowley said in a statement that the department \"is focused solely at this time on discussions associated with the sale of TikTok in accordance with the August 14 divestiture order signed by the President.\" ByteDance has been exploring options including a sale of TikTok's US operations to Microsoft, which is joined with Walmart, or Oracle.</p><p>The talks grew more complicated late last month when China issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, forcing ByteDance to pause and evaluate how the new rules might affect a sale. One question is whether the order would prevent TikTok's all-important algorithms from being included in a deal, with people close to the bidders indicating that if they aren't, the platform becomes much less attractive.</p><p>Even before that, a sale wasn't guaranteed. TikTok filed a lawsuit in late August challenging Mr Trump's executive order that would ban TikTok in the US if it doesn't find a buyer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.15am: </emphasis>Ireland orders Facebook to stop sending user data to the US            </p><p>A European Union privacy regulator has sent Facebook a preliminary order to suspend data transfers to the US about its EU users, according to people familiar with the matter, an operational and legal challenge for the company that could set a precedent for other tech giants.</p><p>The preliminary order, the people said, was sent by Ireland's Data Protection Commission to Facebook late last month, asking for the company's response. It is the first significant step EU regulators have taken to enforce a July ruling about data transfers from the bloc's top court. That ruling restricted how companies like Facebook can send personal information about Europeans to US soil, because it found that Europeans have no effective way to challenge American government surveillance.</p><p/><p>To comply with Ireland's preliminary order, Facebook would likely have to re-engineer its service to silo off most data it collects from European users, or stop serving them entirely, at least temporarily. If it fails to comply with an order, Ireland's data commission has the power to fine Facebook up to 4pc of its annual revenue, or $US2.8 billion.</p><p>Nick Clegg, Facebook's top policy and communications executive, confirmed that Ireland's privacy regulator has suggested, as part of an inquiry, that Facebook can no longer in practice conduct EU-US data transfers using a widely used type of contract.</p><p>\"A lack of safe, secure and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and prevent the emergence of data-driven businesses from the EU, just as we seek a recovery from COVID-19,\" Mr. Clegg said.</p><p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission declined to comment.</p><p>The preliminary order is a victory for European privacy activists, who have been arguing before regulators and in court for the better part of a decade that their data shouldn't be sent to or kept in the US because it could be turned over to the government under secret requests.</p><p>It is also a warning for big tech companies with operations in Europe, and for the trans-Atlantic trade they facilitate. Though the order applies to Facebook, the company may be the first among other US-based tech companies to face similar orders, one of the people familiar with the matter said. At stake is whether the US might have to change its surveillance laws for data transfers to resume, the person added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-0cb904bc56e2a80634795cede0e4f259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T8-8DN1-JBR4-F240-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1373\"/><timeReceived>3:19 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0003BNV</classCode><className>ERNST &amp;

[paragraph] The higher echelons of control come only with obsession. You jack in for 45 minutes on your lunch hour. Afternoon coffee break. At night when your spouse imagines you're cranking away on that office project. They have no idea. But when your fingers brush the keys, out there on the very real streets of Los Angeles, traffic shifts and undulates, like rainwater cutting a path. Homeowners wake up to find themselves trapped in a pop-up freeway hell that makes it nearly impossible to exit their driveways. The transportation officials and the council members and the whining neighborhood associations are mere spectators. The gamers won. The algorithm is God. Technology has spoken, andyou know your supporting role. The unheralded superhero in this movie, giving every Angeleno the power to take back the streets.</p><p>Los Angeles went wild over Waze when it first hit the city in 2011. It was the brash counterpart to the Google and Apple traffic apps that took a more conservative tack to turn-by-turn directions, generally providing two or three traditional highway and thoroughfare routes. Not Waze. One definitive route. The wormhole, the ultimate shortcut, the secret trick to avoid getting screwed on the 405 or the 110. In September 2014 this magazine published \"The Surprising Wisdom of Waze,\" an ode to what seemed algorithmic serendipity, with honeyed lines like, \"To me, Waze is the Voice of God.\"</p><p>Why the adulation? Waze grabbed you--the harried, downtrodden LA. commuter--with the subjective, hard-to-counter feeling that this crazy route over hill and dale just had to be faster. Speeding through residential neighborhoods gave hundreds of thousands of Angelenos something they'd scarcely known in this famously gridlocked city--the sense that they were in control. Early adopters suddenly had a technological edge on those same dummies who pay retail, don't rewind the odometer when they return their leased Porsche, and don't know the tricks to getting a table at Maude. The Waze founders were geniuses. Waze did save you precious minutes...for a while.</p><p>But Waze's algorithmic promise did not last. Today Los Angeles residents could be forgiven for feeling stuck in the film Groundhog Day, waking up over and over again to a tech-triggered, traffic-nightmare time loop now going on five years, with no end in sight. As early as December 2014, L.A. Councilman Paul Krekorian, whose district includes North Hollywood and Studio City, began hearing from the front lines of the nearly 100,000 households he oversees. \"Neighborhood streets that had been quiet all of a sudden during the morning commute were filled bumper to bumper,\" he recalls. \"Residents were forcefully complaining to my office.\" It came on like a tornado. \"There was a sudden change. Mostly in the hillside areas with narrow streets. People looking for shortcuts. The impact was dramatic.\" The minutes or seconds you might save by Wazing transformed dozens of peaceful L.A. neighborhoods into loud, exhaust-fumed residential gridlock. Drivers careened down local streets steeper than double-diamond ski slopes. Trucks got pinned on corners. Citizens fought back, reporting phony crashes and traffic jams in a desperate counterattack. Not so fast. A Waze spokesman, oblivious to the irony, reflexively sneered that \"a group of neighbors can't game the system.\"</p><p>The headlines from that long-ago December captured the first wave of what Krekorian termed \"the ultimate failure of laissez-faire, libertarian thinking,\" what happens when corporations wreak havoc on communities for profit: \"Locals Upset at Google's Waze for Sending Traffic to Their Streets,\" \"L.A. Traffic Is Getting Worse, and People Are Blaming the Shortcut App Waze,\" \"Angry L.A. Residents Are Trying to Sabotage Waze Data to Stop Side-Street Clogging.\" Krekorian's office reached out to Waze and the operators of similar apps and got \"a complete stonewall,\" he says. The L.A. Department of Transportation? \"They got zero response. Quite an arrogant attitude,\" says Krekorian, recalling that Big Tech essentially said, \"It's your problem to fix this.\"</p><p>Our story begins in Israel, where Ehud Shabtai had a seemingly innocent idea: crowdsource the mapping of the Holy Land in Hebrew and share it for free. It made sense: Israeli mobile GPS systems were lousy in the mid-2000s. Shabtai had studied computer science and philosophy at Tel Aviv University, so as a hobby--simply to get around town--he hacked out FreeMap Israel in 2006. He was, as they say, an accidental entrepreneur. Within two years he teamed with Uri Levine and Amir Shinar to code what would evolve into Waze.</p><p>The original Israeli Wazers were playing a game that helped build a product. Drive a Tel Aviv street yet to be mapped, and the app would simultaneously display a trail of pellets, which your digitally represented vehicle would gobble up as you drove along. The Pac-Man-style, Pavlovian design hooked early Wazers and helped make the app \"sticky,\" fueling a rapid global expansion. Shabtai and company raised $67 million between 2008 and 2011. Borrowing from Tom Sawyer's playbook, they enticed legions of map dorks to do the essential early mapping for free. Google snapped up Waze for just shy of a billion dollars in 2013, earning Shabtai $78 million and Levine and Shinar $65 million each. A large chunk of that tremendous wealth was built off the keystrokes of dedicated yet unpaid volunteers. That's hard to comprehend, given the cofounders' $200 million-plus bonanza. But that's where we just don't get it. Tens of thousands of Waze map editors earned another kind of currency: the power to toy with Los Angeles and very nearly every major city on the planet--in effect, to play SimCity with actual cities.</p><p>Want to gain a sense of what took the editors down the wormhole? Log in to your Waze account. Fire up the optional Waze Map Editor Academy introductory video and enter a retro-cartoon video-game world fueled by '80s-era metal rock. A corny, booming voiceover exhorts new editors to \"choose your own adventure...and so much more!\" There's a lot of blasting, flashing, and bleeping as cartoon avatars zip around a Pac-Man-like maze of streets, zapping away. Then, the music abruptly fades as the tutorials segue into a perfunctory audio-free guide.</p><p>This is where anyone can slip online and get a sense of why so many map geeks get hooked: the omnipotence that comes when you--an average citizen--can change the designation of local roads and suggest edits to \"segment attributes\" such as traffic direction, unpaved roads, allowable turns. Yes, it sounds crazy, but you've now joined the local tech transportation underground, usurping powers once held solely by LADOT. Edit more and up goes your status, like earning Boy Scout merit badges. With no programming skills required and no training in transportation planning, safety or management, suddenly you're the behind-the-scenes techie whose awesome back-end coding pushes out to drivers' mobile interfaces within 24 hours.</p><p>One need only skim the city of L.A.'s Complete Streets Official Guide to understand how counter to traditional traffic planning it is to empower untrained amateurs--backed by a massive for-profit corporation--to intentionally wreak havoc on the traffic patterns of America's second-largest metropolis. Weighing in at 244 pages, the guide is meant to \"ensure the safety, accessibility, and convenience of all transportation users\" and divides L.A.'s streets into two broad categories: Arterial Streets--speeifieally designed to \"carry a large volume of regional through traffic not handled by the freeway system\"--and Non-Arterial Streets, which comprise 60 percent of the city's streets. These Collector Streets, Local Streets, and Hillside Streets have circumscribed purposes \"to connect travelers to local residential neighborhoods...and are not intended for cut-through traffic.\" Streets are not created equally. This is about (low dynamics and about engineering for disparate volumes and speeds. Arterial Streets are designed to handle far more traffic and speeds ranging from 30 to 35 miles per hour, while Non-Arterial are designed for local traffic and safer, far slower speeds in the 15-to-20-mph range. \"Hillside streets are often narrow, winding roadways in residential areas,\" states the guide. \"They provide access to hillside communities, such as parts of the Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods of Los Angeles.\" That is, until. Waze came to town and hacked traffic.</p><p>Enter the Waze chat room, and you get a sense of how these unruly map editors are messing with L.A.'s streets. The dialogue includes newbie Level 1 editors on up to seasoned Level 6 area manager \"champs.\" There's Spank-dog, GooberKing, FurryDaddy, Skullzzcode, and Mikey-Pizzaman....It feels like a den of old-school gamers from the internet's 1,200-baud modem days trying to recapture their digital youth. And yet there's something else going on here. Why the pseudonyms? \"They all fear legal liability in case of a bigger accident or traffic situation,\" suggested one Level 1 editor, who tried to obtain the email and contact information of a higher-level editor to no avail. The subterfuge is a sign that something isn't right. If the map editors were serving the public good, why wouldn't Waze and the editors be transparent? But it's more than that. This is a masquerade party. These aren't skilled hackers. They know precious little about traffic management. They're just mapping clerks trying on the personae of techies, with the bizarre reality that their actions often have catastrophic, city-wide ramifications.</p><p>But the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style fantasy frequently clashes with distraught citizens stumbling in from the real world, pleading for help, interactions torn from a Black Mirror episode. \"Waze Uses Dangerous or Low-Capacity Road for Alternate Route\" is a popular thread on Waze's California-area community board. The discussion is illustrated with nightmarish photos and videos shared by residents of a would-be sleepy hilltop neighborhood invaded by the algorithm. No street, certainly not your residential 25-mph variety, is safe from being Wazed into a makeshift freeway or thoroughfare. This has created fascinating potential legal issues that may one day be litigated in lawsuits or class actions. These thousands of homeowners and renters have arguably been injured by Waze's and Google's successful privatization of formerly public streets. The videos speak volumes: an 18-wheeler rubbing against a telephone pole on a steep hairpin turn. Sunday-evening standstill traffic on an erstwhile side street. An SUV, trapped in gridlock, jamming the accelerator for a death-defying right turn across three lanes of traffic.</p><p>A befuddled Level 3 editor from an area deluged with Waze cut-through commuters floats ideas to undo the damage. He suggests setting a segment at each end of a tiny road as \"unpaved.\" Or marking it as a \"gated community.\" Another editor proposes reclassifying it as a \"Passageway,\" a currently unapproved road type. DwarfLord, a Level 5 Los Angeles-area manager, lays down the law. To resist is futile: \"Despite the name, Waze thinks Passageways have the same capacity and safety as freeways,\" he opines, inadvertently underlining the madness of humans granting machines the last word, even if the city street guide caps maximum speeds at 10 to 15 mph for these local roads. DwarfLord's deeper message: The Waze algorithms don't care about the societal cost they inflict and neither does Waze if the algorithm calculates that a cut-through may save seconds. \"The instant the time penalties work out,\" DwarfLord claims, \"Waze will just as happily send a thousand Wazers down a Passageway as it would [a single] one.\" Not only that, but unlike Apple and Google maps, which calculate driving times based on legal speed limits, \"Waze takes the speed of what people are actually driving,\" a Level 1 editor confides. \"If it's a single-lane residential street and the speed limit is 15 mph, but people are speeding through at 35, they will model the time off that data.\" Waze gives the subjective feeling that the Waze route is the shortest. \"A Waze editor showed me how the Waze route down my insane, super-curvy street would save you 17 seconds,\" the Level 1 adds. \"The app tells you to take these crazy roads--it's the culture of shortcutting, a kind of Hunger Games.\"</p><p>The upshot? If the algorithm decrees it may save time, however minuscule, no street is safe. And then comes the kicker, where it becomes clear that L.A.'s citizens, even the editors, are powerless, and the game is no longer fun. It's just impotent, unpaid techie map slaves watching as the algorithm overwhelms its masters like the bucket-wielding brooms in The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Moans DwarfLord: \"Every technique we could try will either have little effect or will have serious drawbacks.\" Adds another editor, \"The benefit to using the app is gone.\"</p><p>In April 2015, Mayor Eric Garcetti trumpeted a data-sharing agreement with Waze that would \"help reduce congestion, increase safety, and improve driving experience around L.A.\" The mayor spoke proudly of this shining example of the city's \"data initiative,\" and how the Waze partnership would \"get people where they want to go, faster.\" The city would share information with the company on traffic accidents, street repairs, and the like; Waze would share its rich. realtime data mined from users about traffic conditions. That was the plan. But traffic worsened. There was a problem with the mayor's public product endorsement: This wasn't a partnership. The proof could be seen just two years later, when the city, dissatisfied with the results, chose not to renew the contract. Explained a spokesperson for LADOT: \"When the agreement expired, the City Council directed the L.A. Department of Transportation to establish and lead a new pilot program with mapping apps that would allow a more active partnership.\" The spokesperson added that the plan was to ensure drivers would be \"directed toward roadways...adequate to handle the volume of diverted traffic.\" But there was more at play here than the absence of a truly collaborative relationship. The devil was in the details: advanced math, economic theory, the nightmarish complexity of modern traffic in the car capital of the world, and something called a Nash equilibrium.</p><p>Alex Bayen, a French-born mathematician who earned his Ph.D at Stanford with a thesis on automating air traffic, is the director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Berkeley. His team of doctorates helped develop the first traffic apps for Nokia more than a decade ago. Bayen understood Waze's early appeal. Sales of iPhones and Androids had yet to fully take off in 2011. \"The knowledge of what Waze was offering was known by only a small percentage of people,\" he says, \"and that gave the opportunity to come up with an interesting shortcut.\"</p><p>Then the math kicked in, and the shortcuts quickly became everyone cuts. By 2014 there were 171 million smartphone users in the U.S. The number of Uber and Lyft drivers in Los Angeles--virtually all reliant on traffic apps--exploded. Angelenos started crying foul. \"It's like a cancer,\" says Bayen. \"It takes some time for the doctor to see it.\" The professor \"knew it was going to happen from theory because we were studying the problem in computer simulations.\" Many dismissed the predictions as \"the problem of academics. 'It's not real.'\" But the minutes once gained by using Waze dwindled to seconds or disappeared. Traffic throughout L.A. worsened, and Waze, in particular, with its rebellious brand built on diverting drivers onto side streets, created what transportation wonks call \"negative externalities\"--and not just in the traffic-congested neighborhoods. Ironically, when too many vehicles ditch the freeway at once, the exit lanes back up, clogging the freeway itself.</p><p>The Waze problem, Bayen argues, today applies equally to Google, Apple, and any other routing agents, in part because they're all competing to get you to a final destination while selling the often illusory promise of speed. \"None of them have any incentive to give you anything else than the fastest path. If they did not give you the fastest path, you would switch apps,\" says Bayen. \"There's no incentive to do something societally efficient. The only way is to give you selfish routing.\"</p><p>But John Nash, the brilliant economist and hero of the 2001 film/1 Beautiful Mind, demonstrated that when you give people \"selfish solutions\" in competitive, \"noncooperative games,\" everyone loses. Counter to the hyped PR tech narrative, Waze, Google, and Apple were all \"steering toward a Nash equilibrium, and that is not a good thing,\" argues Bayen. By promoting the myth that their apps would get you there faster, the tech firms were effectively and collectively creating a perfect traffic storm for everyone. \"The overall benefit is less than equitable [in a Nash equilibrium],\" says Bayen. \"Factor in that there is no incentive for the companies to help society with better routing guidance, and any claim by the corporate PR teams that they are providing better routing guidance is immediately disproved by John Nash.\"</p><p>When Waze wrecked Tim Grant's Hollywood Hills neighborhood a few years ago, he and his husband filmed videos shared on YouTube and Twitter accounts they named Wazed and Confused. Tim became a Level 1 editor, removed his residential route from the map and felt immediate gratification. The traffic instantly returned to normal. \"It was like turning off the faucet,\" he says. But a higher-level editor promptly turned the faucet back on and marked the road off-limits to Level 1s, citing a \"malicious editor.\" Grant says Waze then got his Twitter account shut down and had a lawyer threaten him. In August 2018 Tim's city councilman, David Ryu, sent a letter to the city attorney suggesting legal action against Waze and Google. \"Waze has upended our City's traffic plans, residential neighborhoods, and public safety for far too long,\" Ryu wrote. \"Their responses have been inadequate and their solutions nonexistent</p><p>If we do nothing, Waze will lead us on a race to the bottom--where traffic plans are ignored and every street is gridlocked.\" The letter got headlines, but Ryu, who declined several attempts to be interviewed for this story, has said little on the subject since. He told constituents that Waze would designate a liaison to work with the city, and then the company stopped returning calls. So complete was the stonewalling that Ryu beseeched constituents who had contacts--any contacts--within the Waze-Googleplex to prevail upon them to get his office's calls returned. Waze declined to be interviewed for this article or to answer questions. Instead, a PR representative from Archetype, a San Francisco branding firm, issued a statement that Waze is \"committed to partnering with cities and transit authorities,\" adding that \"we've met with officials many times in an effort to help address the city's traffic issues, and have never declined a request for a meeting.\"</p><p>Councilman Krekorian has had enough of Big Tech PR spin. He knows who is causing the traffic. He wants it to stop. \"Throughout L.A. there are small residential streets that were not designed to accommodate the dramatically increased flow of traffic that these apps arc causing,\" Krekorian said. \"In many cases such streets have become completely gridlocked, defeating the supposed advantages of the apps while ruining the peace and quality of life in entire neighborhoods. Even worse, these apps often route a grossly excessive number of cars onto narrow streets with blind curves and unregulated intersections, and often without sidewalks for pedestrians or room for bicyclists.\"</p><p>Today, with cut-through hillside routes known to hundreds of thousands of L.A. commuters, it's no longer clear the Waze problem can be fixed by shutting off the tech faucets. \"The genie is out of the bottle--it's a classic issue of tech getting out in front of public policy,\" says Dr. Susan Shaheen, the codircctor of UC Berkeley's Transportation Sustainability Center. \"How do you regulate these services for the public good, particularly when access to the data is not good?\" One possible solution: taxing driving. \"To get the genie back into the bottle may require a mechanism as strong as a road charge,\" says Shaheen. \"People are going to pay more [to] access the road. Local service streets may not be accessible to the public.\"</p><p>Krekorian, however, is holding out hope. This spring he led a pilot program to curb Waze traffic on L.A. side streets. LADOT has submitted an initial report with recommendations to the council and is taking the lead on reaching out to the app companies to strike a more evenhanded data-sharing agreement. \"We can seize this opportunity to create a new partnership with one or more of these companies,\" Krekorian says. \"The time is right. We have the ability to provide data to the companies.\" The competitor who does reach an agreement, says the councilman, will have \"a distinct advantage in the car capital of the world.\"</p><p>Adds Marcel Porras, the chief sustainability officer for the city's Department of Transportation: \"Mapping app algorithms have had a negative impact with cut-through traffic. The LADOT has put together a matrix of some of the sensitive areas, and the city is directing us to negotiate a pilot program to address these issues. That's fantastic. We have clear direction. We're hoping we can find agreement with Waze, Google, Apple, and other mapping firms. If not, [the issues] will come back into the hands of the City Council.\"</p><p>But it remains far from clear that the tech companies want to share data and alter their algorithms for the public good.</p><p>That's too bad. Because transparency and improved collaboration between tech firms and L.A. might save lives. Only the city has in-the-moment data on planned closures and emergencies. During the Malibu wildfires Waze showed an algorithmic disregard for human life, reminiscent of Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey, mindlessly sending drivers toward fireballs. Tweeted Andy Ruther at the time: \"I don't trust Waze. It just told me I could save 8 minutes by driving right thru a wildfire off the 405 Freeway.\"</p><p>Tim Grant, for his part, says bring on the tech but stop the corporate PR slogans. Do it for real, for the community. Not just to sell ads or promote a false narrative of speed. \"You know, if they're going to use big data, use all the data,\" says Grant. \"Not just, 'Hey there's a street here' but 'Hey, there's a street here with blind turns, no sidewalks, people pushing strollers, people walking their dogs. It's narrow, and it's just not appropriate.' Take it off, take it off, take it off!\"</p><p>BY JONATHAN LITTMAN ILLUSTRATED BY JASON RAISH</p><p>Caption: WHEELER DEALERS</p><p>Waze cofounder Uri Levine (above) and Mayor Eric Garcetti. The data-sharing agreement struck in 2015 between Waze and L.A., Garcetti promised, would \"get people where they want to go, faster,\" Instead, traffic worsened, and the city let the partnership lapse. Negotiations are underway for a new deal that gives the city more control over Waze and similar apps</p><p>Caption: NO WAZE A screen grab from a Waze discussion board illustrates Los Angeles resident and former Waze editor Tim Grant's attempt to rid his tiny side street of the thousands of commuters clotting it daily. Grant removed his street from the app's maps, and the traffic disappeared \"like turning off a faucet.\" he marveled. A senior Waze editor overruled Grant, declaring him a \"malicious editor\" and restored the street--and its traffic--to Waze's maps</p><p>Caption: FURY ROAD Waze and other traffic apps use algorithms to route vehicles off major thoroughfares and onto side streets never designed to handle such massive traffic volumes. The results, seen in Laurel Canyon (above) --note that oncoming cars are forced to climb an embankment--and near Outpost Drive, are secondary traffic jams that trap neighborhood residents in their homes and maroon emergency vehicles</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-600037271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 600037271</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3J-0P91-JCBJ-K0HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Emmis Publishing L.P. dba Los Angeles Magazine</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Magazine</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1522-9149</issn><volume>Vol. 64</volume><issueNumber>No. 9\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And there is enough concern about Mark Zuckerberg's existing influence that plenty of people have rung alarm bells at the idea of putting him in charge of a global currency to rival the US dollar.</p><p>But make no mistake, in the early 2020s there will be a global digital currency. It could be launched by Facebook, or one of the other leading platform companies such as Amazon, Google, or Apple.</p><p>And while the US dollar may remain intact as the global reserve currency, in non-digital form, countries such as Australia will be forced to consider moving to a fully digital currency sooner rather than later.</p><p>As The Australian Financial Review reported, the Reserve Bank of Australia, in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology, expressed scepticism about both the likelihood of a global stable coin such as Libra and even its usefulness given existing payment technologies in Australia.</p><p>That's the sort of thing they need to say. But it's wrong - and fundamentally misunderstand the power of what economists call \"network externalities\".</p><p>The idea behind Libra is to establish a digital currency backed by real assets. When up and running you would transfer, say, Australian dollars and receive Libra at a given exchange rate into your digital wallet called Calibra. With this you could buy and sell goods and services by tapping your phone or watch, just like using Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p><p>It would run on decentralised blockchain technology which would provide effectively impenetrable security, extremely low operating costs, and the ability to scale and adapt to new technological developments.</p><p>A crucial difference between Libra and a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is that Libra would be backed by a reserve of real assets. Every dollar - not just a portion - converted into Libra would be used to purchase government securities in a basket of different currencies.</p><p>The intrinsic value of the reserve is designed to create stable expectations of the future value of Libra. If people believe that Libra will be a stable store of value, then there is no reason to speculate on it. The Libra reserve would operate much like deposit insurance or government backing of banks - there's no point trying to trigger a bank run if other people rationally believe there is not going to be a bank run.</p><p>Importantly, the Libra Association that governs the reserve and the currency more generally would not be controlled by Facebook, but by a group of non-profits (e.g. Kiva, Women's World Banking), technology and marketplace companies (e.g. Uber, Lyft), venture capitalists, blockchain firms, and telecommunications companies.</p><p>Why, you might ask, would anyone move from their existing mode of payment to a new digital currency?</p><p>For starters, there are an estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world who are unbanked, even though 1 billion of those have a mobile phone and therefore could use Libra. Others pay high fees to transfer money internationally. Still others are fed up with their existing financial institution.</p><p>But most of all, a digital currency backed by a platform such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, or Apple would be easy to use and instantly have hundreds of millions of users. If it's easy and cheap to use a digital currency on Amazon and you already purchase frequently on the platform, why not use it? If it's easy to transfer $20 from splitting a restaurant bill using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, then why use existing bank transfers?</p><p>This is the power of \"network externalities\" - when more people use a product or platform, it increases the value to other consumers. It's the central force which underpins the digital economy. And it's the key advantage which the big tech companies have in what will likely become the \"currency wars\" of the 2020s.</p><p>If this plays out, and one of the big tech companies establishes a global currency that is adopted by a meaningful number of Australians, then the RBA will essentially lose control of monetary policy. The supply of money used in Australia would be determined not by the RBA through setting the cash rate, but by the Libra Association, or the equivalent, if another tech company wins the battle for digital currency supremacy.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve may be able to withstand this threat - some global fiat currency will surely survive. Indeed, some will be needed to provide the asset backing for the digital currency.</p><p>But the current, fiat, the Australian dollar, might not survive.</p><p>A digital Australian dollar, by contrast, could survive. It would provide some of the benefits of Libra to an already financially sophisticated and digitally literate Australian public.</p><p>That prospect would be boosted by Australia pre-emptively adopting a digital Australian dollar. Doing so would lend support to the inevitable march towards digital currencies, but be more on the RBA's terms than completely losing control of monetary policy.</p><p>A digital Aussie dollar would be controlled by the RBA, useful in the basket of currencies used by Libra, and have many of the day-to-day benefits of a cashless society.</p><p>Like it or not, a global digital currency is coming. Like globalisation and automation, we cannot resist the irrepressible tide of technology. But we can pre-empt it to a degree, and do so on our own terms.</p><p>Richard Holden is professor of economics at UNSW Business School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78t8ylpxchs1g02n13ti</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y09-Y441-F0J6-J1FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Currently, these platforms claim that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act preempts local efforts to stop them from listing and booking illegal rentals.</p><p>\u201cPlatforms would also be held accountable if they fail to stop booking illegal rentals after receiving notice from a private property owner that short-term rentals are prohibited at that location,\u201d said Case.</p><p>The Hawai\u2018i Chapter of the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association released a statement in support. Hawai\u2018i Chapter spokesman Kekoa McClellan said \u201cThe PLAN Act will put a stop to the litany of lawsuits filed by hosting platforms who use the courts to shield the brokering of illegal short-term rentals in residential communities across Hawai\u2018i.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese illegal short-term rental operators have no aloha for our way of life, take jobs away from locals, and drive up the cost of housing for all of us who actually call Hawai\u2018i home,\u201d said McClellan. \u201cWe stand with Congressman Case in his fight to protect our neighborhoods, and communities across the country from the explosion of these illegal rentals through the introduction of the PLAN Act.\u201d</p><p>The Hawai\u2018i Chapter of the AHLA counts 150 members, along with 110,000 employees of members throughout the state. McClellan says other Hawai\u2018i organizations and individuals join in the statement from the Hawai\u2018i Chapter of the AHLA including Save O\u2018ahu\u2019s Neighborhoods, Hawai\u2018i Good Neighbor and the Kuli\u2018ou\u2018ou \u2013 Kalani Iki Neighborhood Board.</p><p>The national organization of the AHLA also released a statement in support. \u201cFor too long, these Big Tech short-term rental platforms have been hiding behind this antiquated law in order to bully and threaten legal action against local elected officials who are simply trying to protect their residents from illegal rentals that are destroying neighborhoods and access to affordable housing,\u201d said Chip Rogers, President and CEO of the national American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association. \u201cThese Big Tech rental platforms are invoking a loophole in a federal law to snub their noses at local government leaders across the country, while continuing to profit from illegal business transactions.\u201d</p><p>Rogers continues \u201cFrom an industry perspective, we simply want platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway to abide by the same laws that the hotel industry adheres to, as well as every other law-abiding business, from main street in small towns to central business districts in major cities. Congress should not allow Big Tech rental platforms to operate above the law. We applaud Congressman Case and his bipartisan legislation which will make clear that unlawful short-term rentals and illegal business transactions are not protected under federal law.\u201d</p><p>The Asian American Hoteliers Association (AAHOA) also issued a statement in support of the measure.</p><p>'America's hoteliers support Rep. Case's effort to empower state and local governments and their ability to regulate short-term rentals,\u201d said Rachel Humphrey, President and CEO of the AAHOA. \u201cThis legislation clarifies Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) to prevent the short-term rental industry's willful violations of state and local regulations thoughtfully crafted by lawmakers to protect their communities.\u201d Humphrey goes on to say that \u201cSection 230 is intended to protect bloggers and similar website hosts from liability for objectionable third-party generated content posted to their sites, not multi-billion-dollar corporations that profit from the illicit rentals that their online platforms facilitate. Competition thrives on a level playing field, and AAHOA's members are grateful to Congressman Case for standing up for small businesses with this legislation.'</p><p>From Maui, County Councilmember Tamara Paltin also weighed in, saying \u201cOnline platforms allowing illegal vacation rentals have negatively affected our neighborhoods and communities. Maui County\u2019s residents want the issue to be resolved, and this legislation is a good step in the right direction by protecting and preserving home rule for local municipalities.\u201d</p><p>NOTE: Serving the hospitality industry for more than a century, the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association (AHLA) is the largest national association solely representing all segments of the eight million jobs the U.S lodging industry supports, including brands, hotel owners, REITs, chains, franchisees, management companies, independent properties, bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations and industry suppliers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C , AHLA proudly represents a dynamic hotel industry of more than 54,000 properties that supports $1.1 trillion in U.S sales and generates nearly $170 billion in taxes to local, state and federal governments.</p><p>NOTE: AAHOA is the largest hotel owners association in the world. The over 18,500 AAHOA members own almost one in every two hotels in the United States. With billions of dollars in property assets and hundreds of thousands of employees, AAHOA members are core economic contributors in virtually every community. AAHOA is a proud defender of free enterprise and the foremost current-day example of realizing the American Dream</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2380351I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-JXY1-JDG9-Y062-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ed Case:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Honolulu, HI) U.S. Congressman Ed Case (Hawai'i District 1) introduced on Friday H.R. 4232, a measure to confirm that Internet platforms who knowingly market illegal short-term vacation rentals can be held liable under state and local law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His \"Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods\" (PLAN) Act would end abusive litigation by Internet-based short-term rental platforms like AirBnb, HomeAway, VRBO, Flipkey, and others attempting to avoid accountability for profiting from illegal rentals.</p><p>\"Over the past decade-plus, the short-term vacation rental industry has exploded through these platforms,\" said Case.</p><p>\"While some communities welcome these rentals, which is largely conducted in residential neighborhoods, many others are concerned with several negative consequences.\"</p><p>\"These consequences include the loss of affordable housing as residential units are converted to transient accommodations for tourists,\" said Case. \"And many of the owners and operators of these units are failing to comply with basic consumer safety, public accommodations and tax requirements that the legal lodging industry has had to follow in order to do conduct its business.\"</p><p>\"As a result of these negative impacts, states and local governments from Hawai'i to Maine are updating their land use laws to more tightly regulate short-term rental activity including liability for the platforms, which has triggered lawsuits to challenge these regulations by the online platforms who advertise these short-term rentals.\" Case noted lawsuits that have been filed in a number of jurisdictions including New York City, Boston, Miami, Portland in Oregon, Anaheim, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami Beach, Palm Beach and Santa Monica.</p><p>Case said the PLAN Act would amend federal law to make clear that this statute does not shield Internet-based platforms that facilitate bookings of illegal short-term rentals. Currently, these platforms claim that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act preempts local efforts to stop them from listing and booking illegal rentals.</p><p>\"Platforms would also be held accountable if they fail to stop booking illegal rentals after receiving notice from a private property owner that short-term rentals are prohibited at that location,\" said Case.</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the American Hotel and Lodging Association released a statement in support. Hawai'i Chapter spokesman Kekoa McClellan said \"The PLAN Act will put a stop to the litany of lawsuits filed by hosting platforms who use the courts to shield the brokering of illegal short-term rentals in residential communities across Hawai'i.\"</p><p>\"These illegal short-term rental operators have no aloha for our way of life, take jobs away from locals, and drive up the cost of housing for all of us who actually call Hawai'i home,\" said McClellan. \"We stand with Congressman Case in his fight to protect our neighborhoods, and communities across the country from the explosion of these illegal rentals through the introduction of the PLAN Act.\"</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA counts 150 members, along with 110,000 employees of members throughout the state. McClellan says other Hawai'i organizations and individuals join in the statement from the Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA including Save O'ahu's Neighborhoods, Hawai'i Good Neighbor and the Kuli'ou'ou Kalani Iki Neighborhood Board.</p><p>The national organization of the AHLA also released a statement in support. \"For too long, these Big Tech short-term rental platforms have been hiding behind this antiquated law in order to bully and threaten legal action against local elected officials who are simply trying to protect their residents from illegal rentals that are destroying neighborhoods and access to affordable housing,\" said Chip Rogers, President and CEO of the national American Hotel and Lodging Association. \"These Big Tech rental platforms are invoking a loophole in a federal law to snub their noses at local government leaders across the country, while continuing to profit from illegal business transactions.\"</p><p>Rogers continues \"From an industry perspective, we simply want platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway to abide by the same laws that the hotel industry adheres to, as well as every other law-abiding business, from main street in small towns to central business districts in major cities. Congress should not allow Big Tech rental platforms to operate above the law. We applaud Congressman Case and his bipartisan legislation which will make clear that unlawful short-term rentals and illegal business transactions are not protected under federal law.\"</p><p>The Asian American Hoteliers Association (AAHOA) also issued a statement in support of the measure.</p><p>\"America's hoteliers support Rep. Case's effort to empower state and local governments and their ability to regulate short-term rentals,\" said Rachel Humphrey, President and CEO of the AAHOA. \"This legislation clarifies Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) to prevent the short-term rental industry's willful violations of state and local regulations thoughtfully crafted by lawmakers to protect their communities.\" Humphrey goes on to say that \"Section 230 is intended to protect bloggers and similar website hosts from liability for objectionable third-party generated content posted to their sites, not multi-billion-dollar corporations that profit from the illicit rentals that their online platforms facilitate. Competition thrives on a level playing field, and AAHOA's members are grateful to Congressman Case for standing up for small businesses with this legislation.\"</p><p>From Maui, County Councilmember Tamara Paltin also weighed in, saying \"Online platforms allowing illegal vacation rentals have negatively affected our neighborhoods and communities. Maui County's residents want the issue to be resolved, and this legislation is a good step in the right direction by protecting and preserving home rule for local municipalities.\"</p><p>NOTE: Serving the hospitality industry for more than a century, the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) is the largest national association solely representing all segments of the eight million jobs the U.S. lodging industry supports, including brands, hotel owners, REITs, chains, franchisees, management companies, independent properties, bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations and industry suppliers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AHLA proudly represents a dynamic hotel industry of more than 54,000 properties that supports $1.1 trillion in U.S. sales and generates nearly $170 billion in taxes to local, state and federal governments.</p><p>NOTE: AAHOA is the largest hotel owners association in the world. The over 18,500 AAHOA members own almost one in every two hotels in the United States. With billions of dollars in property assets and hundreds of thousands of employees, AAHOA members are core economic contributors in virtually every community. AAHOA is a proud defender of free enterprise and the foremost current-day example of realizing the American Dream</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123177010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X14-VM91-JCBF-S3HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1181\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ed Case (D-HI) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Honolulu, HI) - U.S. Congressman Ed Case (Hawai'i - District 1) introduced on Friday H.R. 4232, a measure to confirm that Internet platforms who knowingly market illegal short-term vacation rentals can be held liable under state and local law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His \"Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods\" (PLAN) Act would end abusive litigation by Internet-based short-term rental platforms like AirBnb, HomeAway, VRBO, Flipkey, and others attempting to avoid accountability for profiting from illegal rentals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Over the past decade-plus, the short-term vacation rental industry has exploded through these platforms,\" said Case.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While some communities welcome these rentals, which is largely conducted in residential neighborhoods, many others are concerned with several negative consequences.\"</p><p>\"These consequences include the loss of affordable housing as residential units are converted to transient accommodations for tourists,\" said Case. \"And many of the owners and operators of these units are failing to comply with basic consumer safety, public accommodations and tax requirements that the legal lodging industry has had to follow in order to do conduct its business.\"</p><p>\"As a result of these negative impacts, states and local governments from Hawai'i to Maine are updating their land use laws to more tightly regulate short-term rental activity including liability for the platforms, which has triggered lawsuits to challenge these regulations by the online platforms who advertise these short-term rentals.\" Case noted lawsuits that have been filed in a number of jurisdictions including New York City, Boston, Miami, Portland in Oregon, Anaheim, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami Beach, Palm Beach and Santa Monica.</p><p>Case said the PLAN Act would amend federal law to make clear that this statute does not shield Internet-based platforms that facilitate bookings of illegal short-term rentals. Currently, these platforms claim that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act preempts local efforts to stop them from listing and booking illegal rentals.</p><p>\"Platforms would also be held accountable if they fail to stop booking illegal rentals after receiving notice from a private property owner that short-term rentals are prohibited at that location,\" said Case.</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the American Hotel and Lodging Association released a statement in support. Hawai'i Chapter spokesman Kekoa McClellan said \"The PLAN Act will put a stop to the litany of lawsuits filed by hosting platforms who use the courts to shield the brokering of illegal short-term rentals in residential communities across Hawai'i.\"</p><p>\"These illegal short-term rental operators have no aloha for our way of life, take jobs away from locals, and drive up the cost of housing for all of us who actually call Hawai'i home,\" said McClellan. \"We stand with Congressman Case in his fight to protect our neighborhoods, and communities across the country from the explosion of these illegal rentals through the introduction of the PLAN Act.\"</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA counts 150 members, along with 110,000 employees of members throughout the state. McClellan says other Hawai'i organizations and individuals join in the statement from the Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA including Save O'ahu's Neighborhoods, Hawai'i Good Neighbor and the Kuli'ou'ou - Kalani Iki Neighborhood Board.</p><p>The national organization of the AHLA also released a statement in support. \"For too long, these Big Tech short-term rental platforms have been hiding behind this antiquated law in order to bully and threaten legal action against local elected officials who are simply trying to protect their residents from illegal rentals that are destroying neighborhoods and access to affordable housing,\" said Chip Rogers, President and CEO of the national American Hotel and Lodging Association. \"These Big Tech rental platforms are invoking a loophole in a federal law to snub their noses at local government leaders across the country, while continuing to profit from illegal business transactions.\"</p><p>Rogers continues \"From an industry perspective, we simply want platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway to abide by the same laws that the hotel industry adheres to, as well as every other law-abiding business, from main street in small towns to central business districts in major cities. Congress should not allow Big Tech rental platforms to operate above the law. We applaud Congressman Case and his bipartisan legislation which will make clear that unlawful short-term rentals and illegal business transactions are not protected under federal law.\"</p><p>The Asian American Hoteliers Association (AAHOA) also issued a statement in support of the measure.</p><p>\"America's hoteliers support Rep. Case's effort to empower state and local governments and their ability to regulate short-term rentals,\" said Rachel Humphrey, President and CEO of the AAHOA. \"This legislation clarifies Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) to prevent the short-term rental industry's willful violations of state and local regulations thoughtfully crafted by lawmakers to protect their communities.\" Humphrey goes on to say that \"Section 230 is intended to protect bloggers and similar website hosts from liability for objectionable third-party generated content posted to their sites, not multi-billion-dollar corporations that profit from the illicit rentals that their online platforms facilitate. Competition thrives on a level playing field, and AAHOA's members are grateful to Congressman Case for standing up for small businesses with this legislation.\"</p><p>From Maui, County Councilmember Tamara Paltin also weighed in, saying \"Online platforms allowing illegal vacation rentals have negatively affected our neighborhoods and communities. Maui County's residents want the issue to be resolved, and this legislation is a good step in the right direction by protecting and preserving home rule for local municipalities.\"</p><p>NOTE: Serving the hospitality industry for more than a century, the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) is the largest national association solely representing all segments of the eight million jobs the U.S. lodging industry supports, including brands, hotel owners, REITs, chains, franchisees, management companies, independent properties, bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations and industry suppliers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AHLA proudly represents a dynamic hotel industry of more than 54,000 properties that supports $1.1 trillion in U.S. sales and generates nearly $170 billion in taxes to local, state and federal governments.</p><p>NOTE: AAHOA is the largest hotel owners association in the world. The over 18,500 AAHOA members own almost one in every two hotels in the United States. With billions of dollars in property assets and hundreds of thousands of employees, AAHOA members are core economic contributors in virtually every community. AAHOA is a proud defender of free enterprise and the foremost current-day example of realizing the American Dream</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://case.house.gov/media/press-releases/case-introduces-measure-allow-full-enforcement-state-and-local-laws-targeting\">https://case.house.gov/media/press-releases/case-introduces-measure-allow-full-enforcement-state-and-local-laws-targeting</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHM9099119890997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-GHV1-JCCP-0261-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000CQFX</classCode><className>HOMEAWAY INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS561599 ALL OTHER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENT &amp;

How sustainable is it that the biggest stock, Microsoft, is closing in on the value of the whole of London's FTSE 100, an index that includes global giants such as Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC and Unilever?</p><p>How reasonable is it that the value of the five biggest US companies - Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook - is now more than five entire S&amp;P 500 sectors? Or that those five companies make up 20 per cent of the value of the index, up from 16 per cent at the start of the year and the most since the 1970s, according to data from strategist Tim Edwards of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices?</p><p>Many have been warning of froth in tech stocks for years. If they are a bubble it just keeps inflating. These and other highly-profitable, fast-growing companies beat the rest of the market in the bull run. And they beat it again in the bear market.</p><p>Their success explains why the US has done so much better than other markets, too. The equally-weighted version of the S&amp;P 500, in which Amazon and Microsoft are given the same weight as a department store or oil company, is down almost as much as European or British stocks (in dollar terms) since the market peaked in February.</p><p>What can't go on, won't go on. Yet there are solid reasons why the leading US companies are doing better than the pack as what could be the deepest recession since the Great Depression takes hold.</p><p>First, these companies tend not to be heavily indebted, and many are sitting on piles of cash. Microsoft, for example, held $US134bn ($212bn) of cash and short-term investments at the start of this year.</p><p>The most important investment question to ask before buying anything at the moment is whether a company can survive a deep recession. The big US growth companies can mostly answer: yes.</p><p>\"Do you survive to the sunny uplands of 2021?\" asks Neil Robson, head of global equities at Columbia Threadneedle. \"Those large-cap tech stocks don't have that question to face.\" Second, many of the trends exploited by these companies are being reinforced by the lockdown, such as video streaming, online working, socialising and shopping, online advertising and videogaming.</p><p>Third, a deep recession will weaken incumbents in many industries, helping the tech giants disrupt their business models. Bricks-and-mortar retailers struggling to survive will find it even harder to beat Amazon. The same goes for other businesses competing with the rise of cloud computing or new media. The Silicon Valley start-ups that nip at the heels of the big growth companies are likely to find it harder to raise cash, too, reducing the threat from new rivals.</p><p>Finally, there is the recession trade. So long as investors expect a long, drawn-out U-shaped recovery they will continue to worry about stocks sensitive to the economic cycle such as carmakers and airlines. They will prefer quality companies, with features such as low leverage and reliable earnings, that can expand whatever the economy does.</p><p>Only if that reverses does the market rotate out of the big tech and growth names and back to cheap cyclicals. Such a bet on a V-shaped recovery was briefly visible on Friday when hope for a COVID-19 cure rose and lifted bombed-out stocks such as Boeing, Halliburton and Citigroup more than 10 per cent on the day.</p><p>Even some of those who doubt the long-run prospects of the market's leviathans think they are a good place to be for now, because of their ability to withstand recession.</p><p>\"At some stage we would expect tech to be one of the casualties,\" says Ian Harnett, co-founder and chief investment strategist of Absolute Strategy Research, but for now he's positive on companies with strong cash flow. The danger he sees in the longer run is that some of the big companies may be undermined by new regulations or find that even online advertising spending is sensitive to the economy.</p><p>I'm naturally a value guy who likes unloved stocks but, right now, many of the companies that were cheap because they were struggling before the lockdown are more like call options than stocks. If there is a V-shaped rebound, they will be amazing performers as their survival prospects rise. If there isn't, many will go to zero.</p><p>The tech giants offer the opposite bet. Rich with cash, they offer safety and a way to profit in a slow recovery. Unfortunately, much of their growth is already anticipated in the stock price.THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-6d77869c844b11eab17ec0894ce97a91d185144a13aa04b6cf8ee744cf322ed9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR6-V621-F0JP-W3PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009F0K</classCode><className>ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

But there are tempting opportunities in today's market if you realize that this tech boom is fundamentally different than the last one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not about technology. It's about money.</p><p>At some point over the past couple of years, banks and technology firms switched places. Banks used to be the giants sitting on top of mountains of cash, explaining their ambitious merger and acquisition plans.</p><p>Now it's technology companies sitting in that same perch, counting their billions in loose change, and gobbling each other up with gusto.</p><p>The most successful tech companies have so much cash on their balance sheets that they can easily afford to pick up a multi-billion-dollar acquisition -- or a couple for that matter -- whenever the whim strikes. At the end of the most recent quarter, Oracle Corp.was sitting on more than US$20-billion in cash and securities, Cisco Systems Inc. on US$35-billion and Microsoft Corp. on US$37-billion.</p><p>Paying is no problem for these moneybags. Hewlett-Packard Co.agreed this past week to acquire 3Com Corp.for US$3-billion. Earlier this year, Dell Inc.bought Perot Systems for US$3.9-billion, Xerox Corp. picked up Affiliated Computer Services Inc. for US$5.8-billion and Oracle struck a deal to buy Sun Microsystems Inc. for US$7.4-billion (although that one is running into European regulatory obstacles).</p><p>More deals are likely as tech firms try to figure out how to position themselves for a harsh new world.</p><p>One force that's defining that world is the move to \"open-source\" software, which is open to all comers at no cost. Open-source software eats into the lush margins that software companies used to charge for their proprietary products.</p><p>Another factor is competition from India, which is driving down the premium that consultants and software developers can charge for their services.</p><p>Yet another factor is the lack of a Next Big Thing--a killer app or technology breakthrough that would encourage corporate customers to spend billions overhauling their data centres. Especially in this dismal economy, data managers don't see any compelling reason to upgrade; instead they're trying to squeeze pennies out of their IT bills.</p><p>How does a technology firm fight back against these trends? The emerging strategy is to bulk up and offer everything from software and computers to networking and consulting services, on the theory that big customers want one-stop shopping.</p><p>Not that long ago, you could easily have written down the key specialties of most of the big tech companies -- Cisco did networking, IBM did mainframes, Hewlett-Packard did servers, and EMC did storage.</p><p>All those firms now appear to be searching for ways to broaden their product lineups through acquisitions or close relationships with other firms. Cisco earlier this month entered into a partnership with EMC, while H-P acquired 3Com. IBM was rebuffed in its attempt to buy Sun, but it's become best buddies with Juniper, a networking firm.</p><p>The primary goal of these alliances is to offer everything that a data-centre manager at a large company could possibly want in one neat package. The other goal is to do a bit of cross-selling -- when Dell recently acquired Perot Systems, a technology consulting and services firm, it became a foregone conclusion that Dell computers and servers would henceforth become Perot's favoured brand.</p><p>As every major firm rushes to get bigger, it seems inevitable that more acquisitions are in the offing. Investors may want to look at a couple of ways of cashing in.</p><p>One strategy is to look for potential acquisition targets. Red Hat Inc. (RHT/NYSE) is a leader in open source software and enterprise computing based on the Linux operating system. It could make a tempting acquisition for a company like IBM. Conservative investors won't like Red Hat's price-to-earnings ratio of 62, but they'll be impressed by the firm's track record in tripling its revenue over the past four years.</p><p>Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR/NYSE) also sports a price-to-earnings ratio north of 60. While that's a premium valuation, it too could make a nice acquisition for IBM, because of its rapidly growing revenues in the networking area.</p><p>A far more conservative investment would be CGI Group Inc. (GIBa/TSX), the Montreal IT consultant. It's trading for only about 13 times earnings and might help to fill Dell's appetite for computer service firms that can help the computer maker to increase its share of corporate IT budgets.</p><p>Of course, you can also place a bet on the acquisitor, rather than on the target. In the computer world that is taking shape, big is beautiful and few companies are bigger than International Business Machines Corp. (IBM/NYSE) or Microsoft Corp. (MSFT/ NASDAQ). Both are selling for under 20 times earnings, have mountains of cash, and are broadly diversified. Their relatively modest valuations demonstrate just how different this tech boom is from the last one.</p><p>-Ian McGugan is a freelance business journalist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chart/Graph: National Post;

I was puzzled when my eyes noticed a change on the signboard. \"No cash\" changed to \"Cash only\".</p><p>For the uninitiated: Hema Fresh is the supermarket chain brand of Alibaba Group. Its business has expanded fast in China since 2015. It is famous for its fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood, which are all delivered to consumers' homes in an utterly convenient fashion.</p><p>Hema epitomizes a new type of retail that is characterized by its \"cashless\" nature. Customers, be it at the physical stores or online, are required to pay using Hema's own app. Other modes of payments are not acceptable.</p><p>Some mobile-savvy consumers find this convenient. But others, particularly the elderly, prefer to pay by cash. And they complained to the monetary authority when, having queued up carrying their shopping bags heavy with fresh food, they were told by the checkout people to pay the bill using the app, not cash.</p><p>That incident pretty much sums up the current dilemma facing the monetary system. Mobile devices allow convenient and decentralized ways of transferring money. But this is challenging the traditional bank-centric payment paradigms.</p><p>\"We encourage diversified payment methods, either innovative ways of payment co-developed with the new retail industry or the cash should be supported. Consumers have their right to choose any way they prefer to pay,\" said Yu Weiqiang, an official with the Shanghai branch of People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.</p><p>On July 12 last year, the central bank declared that the fiat money in China is renminbi, including notes and coins. \"Any entity or individual resident should not refuse to receive cash,\" said a PBOC statement.</p><p>A campaign started to accept and handle appeals from aggrieved consumers. Anyone whose cash payments were refused in preference to digital payments could complain.</p><p>Retailers and service providers were asked to accept notes and coins. Failure to do so could entail a warning, or even punishment, in terms of administrative measures by the monetary authority, according to the PBOC's regulations.</p><p>So far, 602 cases have been investigated, and 558 of them have re-accepted cash.</p><p>Cash is still in demand, although incumbent payment service providers are under pressure from startups as well as big tech firms.</p><p>Monetary authorities across the globe, it seems, are not exactly in love with the idea of a cashless world. Is it too soon to abandon cash? I wonder.</p><p>According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, in 2017, banknotes and coins in circulation in China accounted for 9.5 percent of the total GDP, slightly down from 10 percent in 2016.</p><p>\"When digitalization is leading payers and payees to demand speedier payments anywhere and anytime, cash is still in demand, and its circulation continues to grow in many jurisdictions,\" said a recent research report from the BIS.</p><p>(China Daily 01/07/2019 page13)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-134593615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4N-VWY1-F11P-X3Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information.

(Dow Jones) -- Amazon.com wants to make your hand a credit card.<br/><br/>The tech giant is creating payment terminals that could be placed in physical stores and allow shoppers to link their card information to their hands, according to people familiar with the matter. Then they could pay for the purchases with their palms, without having to take out a card or phone.</p><p><br/><br/>According to some of the people, the company plans to launch terminals in cafes, fast food restaurants and with other merchants who do regular business with their customers. Amazon declined to comment.<br/><br/>Amazon, like other technology companies, is trying to further integrate into consumers' financial lives, leaving banks and card networks on the edge. Apple filed a credit card last year, and Google is implementing checking accounts. If Amazon terminals are successful, mobile wallets like Apple Pay could jump, while expanding Amazon's already extensive access to consumer data.<br/><br/>Amazon projects are closely watched by both technology and financial companies, which are increasingly in the way of payment. Amazon has been experimenting with payments in its Amazon Go stores, where customers can retire without having to stop to pay. It has also been building Amazon Pay, a digital wallet that consumers can use to make payments at online stores that are not owned by Amazon. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has emphasized the importance of financial services and payments to some senior executives, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.<br/><br/>Plans for terminals are at an early stage. Amazon recently started working with Visa to test terminal transactions and is in conversations with Mastercard, some people familiar with the issue.<br/><br/>Amazon has discussed the project with card issuers. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Synchrony Financial have expressed interest in allowing consumercard accounts to work with these terminals, according to some people.<br/><br/>Card companies are trying to figure out whether tech giants like Amazon claim to be collaborators or competitors, although some believe it's safer to participate in big-tech payment ambitions than risk staying Out. Amazon, for its part, wants the expertise of card companies to protect consumers' accounts.<br/><br/>Still, Amazon will need to allay the concerns of card issuers and networks, including how terminals would detect fraud. The company will also have to win over customers who are wary of providing even more personal information and navigating a climate in which regulators are increasingly skeptical about big technology.<br/><br/>Amazon imagines that customers would first use the terminals to link their debit or credit card information to their hands, people said. The company is considering some optionshow to do it, one of the people said. For example, customers can insert cards into a terminal and then let the terminal scan their hands. From then on, they would only have to place a hand on the terminal to pay a participating trade.<br/><br/>Amazon recently filed a patent application for what it described as a \"contactless biometric identification system,\" which includes \"a handheld scanner that generates images of a user's palm.\"<br/><br/>According to some people, the data that would pass through the terminals, including where and when consumers purchased, would be stored in the Amazon cloud. People would like to integrate this information with consumer spending on Amazon.com, these people said. That could give Amazon more influence to charge advertisers higher prices based on the idea that they can better predict what customers are likely to buy.<br/><br/>The New York Post previously reported that Amazon was testing a payment system that would allow consumers to use their hands to pay on Amazon's Whole Foods chain.<br/><br/>Amazon has had limited success with another payments project that it launched to traditional retailers with its Amazon Pay digital wallet. One obstacle: Stores didn't want to remind their customers about Amazon and were at risk of encouraging them to shop there. That could also be a challenge with the new terminals.<br/><br/>In the short term, Amazon wants to persuade card and network issuers to innovate together, according to people familiar with Amazon's strategy. Some payment companies fear that, in the long run, technology companies, including Amazon, may eliminate them.<br/><br/>Card companies have expressed concern about the potential for fraud with terminals, including how to catch people trying to link their hands to a stolen card. Amazon has said it could blacklist people who use the system fraudulently, some sources said. But that might not prevent cheaters from making one-time purchases of electronics or other high-priced items.<br/><br/>Card issuers also doubt how consumers could add more than one account to their palms and how they could choose between those cards when they pay.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10762183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y61-HVP1-JBJN-M2PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

Kathy Castor (FL14) introduced the PRotecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act (Kids PRIVCY Act), H.R 5703, to strengthen the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Castor\u2019s bill requires opt-In consent for all individuals under 18 and establishes a first-of-its-kind protected class of \u201cYoung Consumers\u201d ages 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p>\u201cOnline and digital technology, tracking and data gathering have outpaced current privacy protections for children and consumers,\u201d said Castor. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to unreasonably use and abuse our children\u2019s personal information, yet many companies have been violating the minimal privacy protections in place today, while devices and applications have become more sophisticated in targeting kids. The Kids PRIVCY Act will update the COPPA to provide families with the necessary tools to keep our kids safe and protect their personal privacy.\u201d</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found here.</p><p>The legislation specifically strengthens privacy protections for children by:</p><p>Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child\u2019s personal information. Creating a Protected Class of \u201cYoung Consumers\u201d Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it. Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children: Prohibits companies from targeting children based on their personal information and behavior. Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time. Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings. Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language. Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties. Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities. Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provision that allow for lax enforcement and rubberstamping of potentially unlawful practices. Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages. Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations. Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.</p><p>\u201cWe applaud and thank Rep. Castor for her thoughtful efforts to protect children and teens online. This bill would provide much needed updates to COPPA, including prohibiting behavioral ad targeting to children, extending privacy protections to teenagers, and ensuring companies cannot pretend they don't see kids on their sites. It would also dramatically enhance enforcement, limiting the ability of companies to take advantage of the FTC's limited bandwidth and skirt the law,\u201d said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense.</p><p>\u201cRep. Castor\u2019s bill gives children and teens real safeguards in our data-driven digital surveillance world. All children under 18 will have automatic built-in protections whenever they download a new app, play a game, use social media on mobile devices or visit a website. Parents will be able to enforce these rights in the courts directly. This important legislation adds new teeth to the law we helped enact in 1998\u2014the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. It will prohibit target marketing to children under 13 and limit other problematic advertising practices that companies have been able to use without any oversight or accountability. Online companies will be less able to evade their obligations to protect the privacy of young people. Our hope is that the House will support this bill and merge it with the Senate\u2019s Markey/Hawley COPPA 2.0 proposal to produce strong pro-kids federal privacy legislation,\u201d said Katharina Kopp, Deputy Director, Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\u201cWe applaud Representative Castor for this important update of COPPA. Her legislation rightly recognizes that no child under 13 should be targeted by manipulative data-driven marketing and that teens deserve their own special protections. Just as importantly, the bill contains important enforcement mechanisms including a private right of action for parents that will make it much harder for Big Tech to write off COPPA penalties as the cost of doing business. We now have two serious legislative proposals \u2013 Representative Castor\u2019s in the House and the Markey/Hawley bill in the Senate \u2013 that would offer children and teens the protections they need on mobile and online platforms. We look forward to working with members of both chambers to move these bills forward,\u201d said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>'The internet and its role in the lives of children and youth is vastly different today than it was at COPPA's passing in 1998. Congresswoman Castor's bill to amend COPPA is a necessary step to ensure the protection of this vulnerable population, especially in its establishment of rights to access, correct, and delete information collected on children and youth online,\u201d said Dr. Brandie Nonnecke, Director, CITRIS Policy Lab, UC Berkeley.

Kathy Castor:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14) introduced the PRotecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act (Kids PRIVCY Act), H.R. 5703, to strengthen the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Castor's bill requires opt-In consent for all individuals under 18 and establishes a first-of-its-kind protected class of \"Young Consumers\" ages 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Online and digital technology, tracking and data gathering have outpaced current privacy protections for children and consumers,\" said Castor. \"Companies shouldn't be allowed to unreasonably use and abuse our children's personal information, yet many companies have been violating the minimal privacy protections in place today, while devices and applications have become more sophisticated in targeting kids. The Kids PRIVCY Act will update the COPPA to provide families with the necessary tools to keep our kids safe and protect their personal privacy.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found here.</p><p>The legislation specifically strengthens privacy protections for children by:</p><p>Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child's personal information.</p><p>Creating a Protected Class of \"Young Consumers\" Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p>Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children: Prohibits companies from targeting children based on their personal information and behavior.</p><p>Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time.</p><p>Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings.</p><p>Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language.</p><p>Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties.</p><p>Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities.</p><p>Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation : Repeals dangerous safe harbor provision that allow for lax enforcement and rubberstamping of potentially unlawful practices.</p><p>Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages.</p><p>Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations.</p><p>Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.</p><p>\"We applaud and thank Rep. Castor for her thoughtful efforts to protect children and teens online. This bill would provide much needed updates to COPPA, including prohibiting behavioral ad targeting to children, extending privacy protections to teenagers, and ensuring companies cannot pretend they don't see kids on their sites. It would also dramatically enhance enforcement, limiting the ability of companies to take advantage of the FTC's limited bandwidth and skirt the law,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense.</p><p>\"Rep. Castor's bill gives children and teens real safeguards in our data-driven digital surveillance world. All children under 18 will have automatic built-in protections whenever they download a new app, play a game, use social media on mobile devices or visit a website. Parents will be able to enforce these rights in the courts directly. This important legislation adds new teeth to the law we helped enact in 1998the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It will prohibit target marketing to children under 13 and limit other problematic advertising practices that companies have been able to use without any oversight or accountability. Online companies will be less able to evade their obligations to protect the privacy of young people. Our hope is that the House will support this bill and merge it with the Senate's Markey/Hawley COPPA 2.0 proposal to produce strong pro-kids federal privacy legislation,\" said Katharina Kopp, Deputy Director, Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\"We applaud Representative Castor for this important update of COPPA. Her legislation rightly recognizes that no child under 13 should be targeted by manipulative data-driven marketing and that teens deserve their own special protections. Just as importantly, the bill contains important enforcement mechanisms including a private right of action for parents that will make it much harder for Big Tech to write off COPPA penalties as the cost of doing business. We now have two serious legislative proposals Representative Castor's in the House and the Markey/Hawley bill in the Senate that would offer children and teens the protections they need on mobile and online platforms. We look forward to working with members of both chambers to move these bills forward,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>\"The internet and its role in the lives of children and youth is vastly different today than it was at COPPA's passing in 1998. Congresswoman Castor's bill to amend COPPA is a necessary step to ensure the protection of this vulnerable population, especially in its establishment of rights to access, correct, and delete information collected on children and youth online,\" said Dr. Brandie Nonnecke, Director, CITRIS Policy Lab, UC Berkeley.

Kathy Castor, D-Fla. (11th CD), has issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14) introduced the PRotecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act (Kids PRIVCY Act), H.R. 5703, to strengthen the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Castor's bill requires opt-In consent for all individuals under 18 and establishes a first-of-its-kind protected class of \"Young Consumers\" ages 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Online and digital technology, tracking and data gathering have outpaced current privacy protections for children and consumers,\" said Castor. \"Companies shouldn't be allowed to unreasonably use and abuse our children's personal information, yet many companies have been violating the minimal privacy protections in place today, while devices and applications have become more sophisticated in targeting kids. The Kids PRIVCY Act will update the COPPA to provide families with the necessary tools to keep our kids safe and protect their personal privacy.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found here.</p><p>The legislation specifically strengthens privacy protections for children by:</p><p>* Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child's personal information.</p><p>* Creating a Protected Class of \"Young Consumers\" Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p>* Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children: Prohibits companies from targeting children based on their personal information and behavior.</p><p>* Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time.</p><p>* Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings.</p><p>* Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language.</p><p>* Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties.</p><p>* Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities.</p><p>* Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provision that allow for lax enforcement and rubberstamping of potentially unlawful practices.</p><p>* Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages.</p><p>* Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations.</p><p>* Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.</p><p>\"We applaud and thank Rep. Castor for her thoughtful efforts to protect children and teens online. This bill would provide much needed updates to COPPA, including prohibiting behavioral ad targeting to children, extending privacy protections to teenagers, and ensuring companies cannot pretend they don't see kids on their sites. It would also dramatically enhance enforcement, limiting the ability of companies to take advantage of the FTC's limited bandwidth and skirt the law,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense.</p><p>\"Rep. Castor's bill gives children and teens real safeguards in our data-driven digital surveillance world. All children under 18 will have automatic built-in protections whenever they download a new app, play a game, use social media on mobile devices or visit a website. Parents will be able to enforce these rights in the courts directly. This important legislation adds new teeth to the law we helped enact in 1998-the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It will prohibit target marketing to children under 13 and limit other problematic advertising practices that companies have been able to use without any oversight or accountability. Online companies will be less able to evade their obligations to protect the privacy of young people. Our hope is that the House will support this bill and merge it with the Senate's Markey/Hawley COPPA 2.0 proposal to produce strong pro-kids federal privacy legislation,\" said Katharina Kopp, Deputy Director, Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\"We applaud Representative Castor for this important update of COPPA. Her legislation rightly recognizes that no child under 13 should be targeted by manipulative data-driven marketing and that teens deserve their own special protections. Just as importantly, the bill contains important enforcement mechanisms including a private right of action for parents that will make it much harder for Big Tech to write off COPPA penalties as the cost of doing business. We now have two serious legislative proposals - Representative Castor's in the House and the Markey/Hawley bill in the Senate - that would offer children and teens the protections they need on mobile and online platforms. We look forward to working with members of both chambers to move these bills forward,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>\"The internet and its role in the lives of children and youth is vastly different today than it was at COPPA's passing in 1998. Congresswoman Castor's bill to amend COPPA is a necessary step to ensure the protection of this vulnerable population, especially in its establishment of rights to access, correct, and delete information collected on children and youth online,\" said Dr. Brandie Nonnecke, Director, CITRIS Policy Lab, UC Berkeley.

Kathy Castor (D-FL) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14) introduced the PRotecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act (Kids PRIVCY Act), H.R. 5703, to strengthen the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Castor's bill requires opt-In consent for all individuals under 18 and establishes a first-of-its-kind protected class of \"Young Consumers\" ages 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Online and digital technology, tracking and data gathering have outpaced current privacy protections for children and consumers,\" said Castor. \"Companies shouldn't be allowed to unreasonably use and abuse our children's personal information, yet many companies have been violating the minimal privacy protections in place today, while devices and applications have become more sophisticated in targeting kids. The Kids PRIVCY Act will update the COPPA to provide families with the necessary tools to keep our kids safe and protect their personal privacy.\"</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found here <url normalizedValue=\"https://castor.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hr_5703_-_kids_privcy_act.pdf\">https://castor.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hr_5703_-_kids_privcy_act.pdf</url>.</p><p>The legislation specifically strengthens privacy protections for children by:</p><p>* Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child's personal information.</p><p>* Creating a Protected Class of \"Young Consumers\" Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p>* Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children: Prohibits companies from targeting children based on their personal information and behavior.</p><p>* Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time.</p><p>* Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings.</p><p>* Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language.</p><p>* Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties.</p><p>* Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities.</p><p>* Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provision that allow for lax enforcement and rubberstamping of potentially unlawful practices.</p><p>* Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages.</p><p>* Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations.</p><p>* Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.</p><p>\"We applaud and thank Rep. Castor for her thoughtful efforts to protect children and teens online. This bill would provide much needed updates to COPPA, including prohibiting behavioral ad targeting to children, extending privacy protections to teenagers, and ensuring companies cannot pretend they don't see kids on their sites. It would also dramatically enhance enforcement, limiting the ability of companies to take advantage of the FTC's limited bandwidth and skirt the law,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense.</p><p>\"Rep. Castor's bill gives children and teens real safeguards in our data-driven digital surveillance world. All children under 18 will have automatic built-in protections whenever they download a new app, play a game, use social media on mobile devices or visit a website. Parents will be able to enforce these rights in the courts directly. This important legislation adds new teeth to the law we helped enact in 1998--the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It will prohibit target marketing to children under 13 and limit other problematic advertising practices that companies have been able to use without any oversight or accountability. Online companies will be less able to evade their obligations to protect the privacy of young people. Our hope is that the House will support this bill and merge it with the Senate's Markey/Hawley COPPA 2.0 proposal to produce strong pro-kids federal privacy legislation,\" said Katharina Kopp, Deputy Director, Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\"We applaud Representative Castor for this important update of COPPA. Her legislation rightly recognizes that no child under 13 should be targeted by manipulative data-driven marketing and that teens deserve their own special protections. Just as importantly, the bill contains important enforcement mechanisms including a private right of action for parents that will make it much harder for Big Tech to write off COPPA penalties as the cost of doing business. We now have two serious legislative proposals - Representative Castor's in the House and the Markey/Hawley bill in the Senate - that would offer children and teens the protections they need on mobile and online platforms. We look forward to working with members of both chambers to move these bills forward,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>\"The internet and its role in the lives of children and youth is vastly different today than it was at COPPA's passing in 1998. Congresswoman Castor's bill to amend COPPA is a necessary step to ensure the protection of this vulnerable population, especially in its establishment of rights to access, correct, and delete information collected on children and youth online,\" said Dr. Brandie Nonnecke, Director, CITRIS Policy Lab, UC Berkeley.

This line from Voltaire's Candide also applies to the advertisements that follow you from site to site on the open Internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So says JB Rudelle, founder of advertising tech firm Criteo. The Frenchman puts it this way: \"Is advertising just visual pollution or is it adding some real value? If people find it useful, then it's the best possible advertising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our purpose is to show the right ad to the right user at the right time and the right place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"New discovery - that's what we're trying to do. We have no interest in showing a banner ad to someone if we don't think there's a reasonable likelihood that they're going to click on the ad. We get paid only if there are true engagements.\"</p><p>One of the fiercest independent contenders in the ad tech space, Criteo has built a centralised platform where retailers can buy digital ad inventory programmatically to retarget online shoppers who have previously browsed their products.</p><p>Last year, Criteo's revenue accounted for 7.4 per cent of the worldwide market for digital advertising software - the top market share - according to market intelligence firm IDC. Google was the second largest vendor with a 6.5 per cent share.</p><p>But Criteo has since faced growth challenges, and earlier this year the firm's board sought out Mr Rudelle - who founded the firm in 2005 as a startup in a Parisian salad bar - to pick up the reins again, so he did.</p><p>He returned to the role of chief executive in April, double-hatting as chief product officer to accelerate product innovation. He had earlier tried to wind down his involvement in Criteo by moving from CEO to executive chairman back at the end of 2015, when the company was in a steady state.</p><p>Speaking to The Business Times during a visit at end-August, Mr Rudelle says: \"We got hit last year by a change in the set-up of Apple which created some truckwaves in the company. So there was some necessity to change the way we were doing things and to reinvent the company.\"</p><p>Apple launched iOS 11 in September last year, and followed up with iOS 11.2 in December. The new software includes a feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) that prevents third parties from tracking users on the Safari Web browser for more than 24 hours after a user visited a website.</p><p>So while popular sites like Facebook and Google avoided calamity, Criteo, a third-party system that coordinates cookies in the background, was hit hard.</p><p>In the three months ended June 30, user coverage limitations in Safari resulted in a 3 per cent dip in same-client revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs from the same period a year earlier, Criteo reported in August.</p><p>Mr Rudelle refers to last year's developments as a \"very good wake-up call\".</p><p>He adds: \"It took probably a bit too long for us to react on this. In the last 12 months we made a big re-engineering of our platform to be much less cookie-dependent.</p><p>\"In the early days of Criteo, 100 per cent of our ID (consumer identification) solution was based on cookies. Now a growing part of this is based on other type of IDs.\"</p><p>He won't say exactly how much Criteo has reduced its reliance on cookies. Instead, he notes that the company is now less vulnerable to surprise actions by any one browser manufacturer. Other factors are driving change too.</p><p>Smartphone users are increasingly spending more time glued to native apps, rather than the mobile Web. Mobile apps cannot share cookie information with each other, so cookie tracking can't be relied on.</p><p>\"Especially in South-east Asia, apps are already 60-70 per cent of our business. Everyone is on mobile, not mobile Web, but mobile apps. In those countries we run the majority of our business without any cookies,\" Mr Rudelle says.</p><p>App retargeting is now the fastest-growing area for Criteo. It also uses other technologies including hashed e-mails and login data from various client portals to get the job done.</p><p>In Asia, phone numbers are particularly important, Mr Rudelle adds: \"More and more users identify themselves with not e-mail, but phone numbers. A lot of service providers don't even bother asking you for your e-mail.\"</p><p>The man has other trends to reckon with.</p><p>Consumers, once unwitting cash cows who gave their data up freely to Big Tech, are starting to question the lack of transparency surrounding how their data is tracked and monetised by companies like Criteo.</p><p>In the European Union, this movement is embodied by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new legal requirement that governs how personal data is processed, stored, used and exchanged.</p><p>Though the impact to Criteo's topline has not been as bad as it had braced for since the new rules came into force in May, Mr Rudelle notes that GDPR could eventually influence privacy regulation around the world.</p><p>California passed its own digital privacy law in June.</p><p>Yet Criteo is up to the challenge, he says: \"You have to find the exact right balance between providing a safe, controlled environment for the user and at the same time you don't want to kill the browsing experience by forcing users to agree every five seconds about how their data is used.</p><p>\"(Consumer) privacy, this is something that started in Europe. We're building a lot of experience, and I think the experience we are gaining in Europe is going to help us get an edge in other markets. We already know what are the best practices.\"</p><p>Another question being asked is whether consumers should be better compensated for the data they generate, which companies aggregate and build businesses upon.</p><p>For this French boss, the equation is very simple. His reply is firm: \"You have two kinds of consumers. You have the ones that are highly sensitive to the usage of their data and they don't want anyone to use their data in any respect. Which is totally OK, you have to respect those users. The consequence for these guys is that you see ads that are highly irrelevant. There is no way to show them anything relevant. So it's a trade-off.</p><p>\"The vast majority of users accept controlled use of their data, and you have to give them something in exchange. Typically what they get in exchange is added-value advertising. I think this is the right balance. Especially when it is non-sensitive data like buying a phone.\"</p><p>Independent advantage</p><p>As tumultuous as it gets in the highly-competitive ad tech industry, Mr Rudelle is convinced that the dominance of Google and Facebook in digital advertising can be played to Criteo's advantage.</p><p>By most counts, media owners Google and Facebook are a duopoly in digital ad spending (not ad tech spending).</p><p>But Mr Rudelle has observed that brands and retailers are increasingly trying to reduce their reliance on the two giants, and are eager to work with Criteo strategically to do so.</p><p>He explains: \"Facebook is an ecosystem on its own with its own rules. In that closed ecosystem, they (advertisers) don't have the freedom to use their data, and they don't have any choice. This is the Facebook way, that's it.</p><p>\"We think there is a huge opportunity outside of those ecosystems for our clients. The open Internet is pretty much everyone else outside of social and search where there is empowerment of buyers to use their own data in the way they want.\"</p><p>Criteo's advantage is that it's seen as a pure tech partner, with no hidden agendas, he explains.</p><p>\"We are not in the business of replacing our clients with our own services. You've seen all the giants trying to control the direct relationship with the end user. They are themselves media companies so they are not completely neutral in terms of the destination for the end user. Us, we do tech and just tech, nothing else.\"</p><p>His pitch to small and medium-size enterprises is that Criteo will help them maintain control of their own \"destiny\", namely control over the relationship they have with their end users and control over their own data.</p><p>Basically, it's a power play. Mr Rudelle illustrates: \"Search is typically part of your marketing mix. If you are very dependent on Google for buying search, do you want to rely on the same company for your display buying? Do you want to rely on the same company for all your advertising stack'</p><p>\"You never know when these companies may change their policies. And I know numerous examples where a company gets crushed. Not always intentionally but when you are facing something very big and you are small, you are in an uncomfortable position where you don't have much say about how things are going to be.\"</p><p>This, in essence, is Criteo's new strategic direction. Google has cornered search and Facebook has cornered social media. So the open Internet is where Criteo is playing for keeps.</p><p>The right business model</p><p>Mr Rudelle is only at the beginning of the journey to reposition Criteo from an ad platform of choice into a strategic partner for the open Internet.</p><p>But he's no stranger to change and iteration. After all, Criteo had pivoted four times to find the correct business model before growth took off.</p><p>The company began in 2005 as a modest film recommendations site, with a B2C (business to consumer) model of traffic monetisation that was \"completely unsuccessful\", Mr Rudelle recalls.</p><p>He founded the company with two former Microsoft engineers, Romain Niccoli and Franck Le Ouay, while managing an organic salad bar with his wife in Paris. Criteo operated out of a spare room in the back.</p><p>Mr Rudelle says: \"We had a great technology but in the first place we didn't have a right business model. And you learn the hard way that you can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't have the right go-to-market strategy and the right pricing model, it's useless.</p><p>\"You see a lot of companies with good tech that just die, because they don't find the right marketing mix. We started to grow really fast three years later once we found the right business model.\"</p><p>Criteo made its initial public offering on the Nasdaq in 2013. At the end of June this year, it had 18,936 clients, with a retention rate of close to 90 per cent. It engages 1.4 billion users across the world, and sees over US$700 billion in annual e-commerce sales data.</p><p>He may have got into the business of ad tech through a rather indirect path, but Mr Rudelle is no less clear in his purpose.</p><p>He's an entrepreneur, he says, and therefore an optimist. So competition and regulatory risks are opportunities to him, not challenges.</p><p>\"Advertising is part of the business milieu of the Internet. There are a lot of services that cannot survive without advertising dollars,\" he adds.</p><p>JEAN-BAPTISTE RUDELLE</p><p>CEO and Founder, Criteo</p><p>1969 Born in France</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>1989 - 1991: Imperial College London</p><p>1991 - 1993: Sup\u00e9lec engineering school</p><p>CAREER</p><p>1993 - 1996: Engineer, Asia Pacific Export</p><p>1996 - 1999: Senior Consultant, Roland Berger &amp; Partners</p><p>1999 - 2004: Founder and CEO, Kiwee (mobile ringtone downloads)</p><p>2005 - 2015: Founder and CEO, Criteo</p><p>2017 - 2018: Founder and CEO, LESS (ride-sharing service)</p><p>Since April 2018 - CEO, Criteo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"New discovery - that's what we're trying to do.

This is important. Miss Bessant has just been named the most powerful women in banking by the American banker and that's the second year in a row. So, I want to ask about threepeats (ph), Cathy, but thanks for being here. It's good to have you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  We're always going upward, David. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So we've a lot of things to talk about Bank of America, about women in the workplace. But let's start with this Bloomberg story this morning, about this hardware hack as it were that really infiltrated some U.S. companies according to Bloomberg reporting.  </p><p>      I know that cybersecurity is right at the top of your list of priorities as Brian Moynihan's. What was your initial reaction when you read this? First of all, how do you know Bank of America doesn't have this problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, let's start with cybersecurity has to be at the top of every corporation's list. It's a ubiquitous risk and it's potentially systemic. So it's real. When I saw the news this morning my first reaction was, well, third party and fourth party risk is in fact I think the greatest source of risk to any supply chain for any company has. It's not just the companies that work with, but the companies they work with.  </p><p>      So, understanding the risk of the lineage of the hardware and software that actually goes to market, understanding where people are working with what vendors. People tell us all the time we're tough to do business with. I've actually become very proud of that on behalf of our customers and clients. I actually don't think it should be easy to put technology into the marketplace.  </p><p>      One thing I don't think has gotten enough conversation this morning, though, is we're talking about the chip and its detection. There are other mechanisms for prevention of risk that comes with that. We look at how data moves in our company. So, if somebody is a resident in our own hardware, could they actually get anything that was important to us? If the data moves, would we know?  </p><p>      And so, all of the emerging excellence in cybersecurity is really multiple layers of defense coupled with great tech investment which you know we do a lot of it and great talent. So, it's a multilayer defense strategy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  So has a hardware hack possibility been in your radar screen? Because we just haven't been covering stories like this. It's always been software, it's always been data access, it hasn't been actually something physically implanted in your machine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  I think that's really important part of the discussion. What this story reminds people or tells people for the first time his hardware risk is real. I think the risk is always been there but real manifestations of it that go beyond the hype or the fear that gets generated, those manifestations are very important. And this will spark a new dialogue.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So how you look at it in terms of protection? Because I was on a panel where I talked to three CFOs, three totally different companies, utilities, big tech and trucking. And then they're like, we literally can't spend all of our money on cybersecurity. We could but we can't. So you have to pick and choose what sponsor most vulnerable. How do you determine that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, what's good thing and challenge is our company gives us unlimited budget in terms of tech investment and people investment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  I see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  I always say the most important thing in cyber defense is caliber of talent, the team you actually put on the wall to prevent intrusion, to detect it, and then if or when that detected mitigated brilliantly. So, a lot of the success, in fact, I would -- to be all of this success we've had in this space in protecting our customers and teams to the talent we've got.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  What's the role of government in this and particularly your relations with government? When you hear that the FBI has been investigating this particular chip for some time, certainly it wasn't made publicly known, it may have been communicated to individual companies, but from your experience, you have a great relationship? Do they call you up? Do they say, boy, we think we have a problem here or vice versa? Do you share information with them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  it's a two direction and multilateral sharing. I would say the most important role the government has is to cause and mandate that sharing to occur. There is no competitive advantage to secrets in this space especially regarding risks and sharing is the key to prevention and detection.  </p><p>      People ask about regulation. I'm not sure regulation is the answer. I do know that government has a huge role to play in how we share data with each other.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Throughout the last hour and half we've been talking in different ways of sort of the next cold war say in technology for example. In your experience and expertise, how vulnerable are U.S. companies versus other companies in the world versus other countries in the world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, I think any company, regardless of where it's (INAUDIBLE) their headquarter that has a global presence and sources globally is more at risks than a company that's insulare (ph) and stays at home. So, I would say the risk of amped up for global firms in a lot of ways that scale that causes of global firm to be in existence is important to defense. Defense does take money and people and it takes really sustain investment over time. We've had a dedicated information security team centralized team with enforcement authority in the company since 2008.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  How is Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch position particularly when it comes to trade problems, international problems? Because you have very substantial domestic U.S. deposit taking base that you offer now. You have international operations to be sure. I know you had a China operation I think you actually shut it down at some point. Are you more or less exposed? And in fact we do end up substantial, can I say, globalization?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well our customers, no matter what jurisdiction or regulations or country by country regulation exist, our customers are global. And so we'll do whatever it takes in terms of innovation or business model to make sure we can serve their needs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Well, let's turn into your fabulous award you won. It's aw way to talk about gender diversity because it's not just sort of the buzzword, ESG (ph) thing, right? I mean look at California they're now requiring women on board. What do you think about that? Like that kind of requirement like Norway has which apparently hasn't really well for diversity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, I'm not sure requirements are the answer. I don't think prescriptions about where talent should be used or how talent should be applied. And as a woman, I would never ever want to think (INAUDIBLE) to the strong women I know want to think they got the job because of a law or a mandate.  </p><p>      What I do think is this, 50% of the people in the workforce are women. 50% of the people to join our company are women. As long as you get to higher levels of management, 50% of our people are women. When 50% of our CEO's aren't women we have a measure of progress we have got to make.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>:  We have to make but how do we make it? I mean you have this experience in the boardroom, in the C-suite. I mean how do we get there? Because we talked about it a lot. We don't seem to be getting there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  I'm very fortunately because its front and center in the conversations at the firm, 40% of our board is diverse, 40% women, 40% of our management team is women, 40% of our top 1000. So, I'm lucky and that it's an active conversation  </p><p>      I will say this, I don't think that the talk and action and dedicated smart people that have been working on gender diversity for decades, I don't think we're seeing the progress that all of that thought should produce. I've been thinking a lot about what should I be working on over the next year. I'm starting to have emerging theories about our women in power alley jobs. Jobs that take them to CEO roles. I don't know I know the answer to the next five years. I know that what we've been doing in the past hasn't been getting us where we want to go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  All right. Just one other question like what's the problem? Because now it's like CEOs are talking about it. There's a mandate in California. Like it's on there. It's up there. Shareholders want it. What's the biggest holdup that you see?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, I actually don't know the answer to that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Fair point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  I wish I knew. If I knew, more than one of my direct reports would be to a woman. I do know this. Three years ago, three of my direct reports where women, two hired way by other firms. We aren't doing ourselves as corporate industry and industry being, you know, helping create new pipelines of talent where approaching each others talent, for a lot of -- in some cases really good reasons. When I do think the focus -- our focus as a firm is ensuring that the pipeline is strong enough to produce the kind of results that take -- that get us to that 40% of our senior workforce being women.  </p><p>      Tech disciplines if you don't mind by saying that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Tech disciplines are really hard, right? We can say 50% of the entering workforce in general is women in U.S. colleges and universities this year. About 17% of the STEM, the engineering technology math graduates, 17% of them will be women. So, from the start in the tech disciplines we under index. And again, fortunate to work for a firm how's all over this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  So, to brought now here and it's great to get you here to get your focus on to the next year. As you look at 2018, what's the biggest risk? What will keep you up most at night?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BESSANT</emphasis>:  Well, the cyber reports to me, I focused every single day on cyber. And if the board was asking me, I would say third-party risks in cyber. So you've given us a great platform to talk about that today. I also think the pace of change, regardless of whether its cyber or technology in general, one thing I spent a lot of time thinking about is has the pace of change exceed in enterprise's ability to keep up with it. So, and I believe there are lots of solutions to that. That will be a huge focus for the firm as we move in to next year in my spaces.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>:  Cathy, so great to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Catherine Bessant of Bank of America, Chief Operations and Technology Officer. Great, great to see you.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDV-JJS1-JDPT-T0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

What's the biggest holdup that you see?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, I actually don't know the answer to that.</p><p>STEEL: Fair point.</p><p>BESSANT: I wish I knew. If I knew, more than one of my direct reports would be to a woman. I do know this. Three years ago, three of my direct reports where women, two hired way by other firms. We aren't doing ourselves as corporate industry and industry being, you know, helping create new pipelines of talent where approaching each others talent, for a lot of -- in some cases really good reasons. When I do think the focus -- our focus as a firm is ensuring that the pipeline is strong enough to produce the kind of results that take -- that get us to that 40% of our senior workforce being women.</p><p>Tech disciplines if you don't mind by saying that.</p><p>STEEL: Yes.</p><p>BESSANT: Tech disciplines are really hard, right? We can say 50% of the entering workforce in general is women in U.S. colleges and universities this year. About 17% of the STEM, the engineering technology math graduates, 17% of them will be women. So, from the start in the tech disciplines we under index. And again, fortunate to work for a firm how's all over this.</p><p>STEEL: So, to brought now here and it's great to get you here to get your focus on to the next year. As you look at 2018, what's the biggest risk? What will keep you up most at night?</p><p>BESSANT: Well, the cyber reports to me, I focused every single day on cyber. And if the board was asking me, I would say third-party risks in cyber. So you've given us a great platform to talk about that today. I also think the pace of change, regardless of whether its cyber or technology in general, one thing I spent a lot of time thinking about is has the pace of change exceed in enterprise's ability to keep up with it. So, and I believe there are lots of solutions to that. That will be a huge focus for the firm as we move in to next year in my spaces.</p><p>STEEL: Cathy, so great to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Catherine Bessant of Bank of America, Chief Operations and Technology Officer. Great, great to see you.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAVID WESTIN, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  We want to welcome Catherine Bessant,  she's Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch Chief Operations and Technology  Officer.  This is important.  Miss Bessant has just been named the most  powerful women in banking by the American banker and that's the second year  in a row.  So, I want to ask about threepeats (ph), Cathy, but thanks for  being here.  It's good to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CATHERINE BESSANT, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH CTO:  We're always going  upward, David.  Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WESTIN:  So we've a lot of things to talk about Bank of America, about  women in the workplace.  But let's start with this Bloomberg story this  morning, about this hardware hack as it were that really infiltrated some  U.S. companies according to Bloomberg reporting.</p><p> I know that cybersecurity is right at the top of your list of priorities as  Brian Moynihan's.  What was your initial reaction when you read this?   First of all, how do you know Bank of America doesn't have this problem?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, let's start with cybersecurity has to be at the top of  every corporation's list.  It's a ubiquitous risk and it's potentially  systemic.  So it's real.  When I saw the news this morning my first  reaction was, well, third party and fourth party risk is in fact I think  the greatest source of risk to any supply chain for any company has.  It's  not just the companies that work with, but the companies they work with.</p><p> So, understanding the risk of the lineage of the hardware and software that  actually goes to market, understanding where people are working with what  vendors.  People tell us all the time we're tough to do business with.   I've actually become very proud of that on behalf of our customers and  clients.  I actually don't think it should be easy to put technology into  the marketplace.</p><p> One thing I don't think has gotten enough conversation this morning,  though, is we're talking about the chip and its detection.  There are other  mechanisms for prevention of risk that comes with that.  We look at how  data moves in our company.  So, if somebody is a resident in our own  hardware, could they actually get anything that was important to us?  If  the data moves, would we know?</p><p> And so, all of the emerging excellence in cybersecurity is really multiple  layers of defense coupled with great tech investment which you know we do a  lot of it and great talent.  So, it's a multilayer defense strategy.</p><p> WESTIN:  So has a hardware hack possibility been in your radar screen?   Because we just haven't been covering stories like this.  It's always been  software, it's always been data access, it hasn't been actually something  physically implanted in your machine.</p><p> BESSANT:  I think that's really important part of the discussion.  What  this story reminds people or tells people for the first time his hardware  risk is real.  I think the risk is always been there but real  manifestations of it that go beyond the hype or the fear that gets  generated, those manifestations are very important.  And this will spark a  new dialogue.</p><p> ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  So how you look at it in terms of  protection?  Because I was on a panel where I talked to three CFOs, three  totally different companies, utilities, big tech and trucking.  And then  they're like, we literally can't spend all of our money on cybersecurity.   We could but we can't.  So you have to pick and choose what sponsor most  vulnerable.  How do you determine that?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, what's good thing and challenge is our company gives us  unlimited budget in terms of tech investment and people investment.</p><p> STEEL:  I see.</p><p> BESSANT:  I always say the most important thing in cyber defense is caliber  of talent, the team you actually put on the wall to prevent intrusion, to  detect it, and then if or when that detected mitigated brilliantly.  So, a  lot of the success, in fact, I would -- to be all of this success we've had  in this space in protecting our customers and teams to the talent we've  got.</p><p> WESTIN:  What's the role of government in this and particularly your  relations with government?  When you hear that the FBI has been  investigating this particular chip for some time, certainly it wasn't made  publicly known, it may have been communicated to individual companies, but  from your experience, you have a great relationship?  Do they call you up?   Do they say, boy, we think we have a problem here or vice versa?  Do you  share information with them?</p><p> BESSANT:  it's a two direction and multilateral sharing.  I would say the  most important role the government has is to cause and mandate that sharing  to occur.  There is no competitive advantage to secrets in this space  especially regarding risks and sharing is the key to prevention and  detection.</p><p> People ask about regulation.  I'm not sure regulation is the answer.  I do  know that government has a huge role to play in how we share data with each  other.</p><p> STEEL:  Throughout the last hour and half we've been talking in different  ways of sort of the next cold war say in technology for example.  In your  experience and expertise, how vulnerable are U.S. companies versus other  companies in the world versus other countries in the world?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, I think any company, regardless of where it's (INAUDIBLE)  their headquarter that has a global presence and sources globally is more  at risks than a company that's insulare (ph) and stays at home.  So, I  would say the risk of amped up for global firms in a lot of ways that scale  that causes of global firm to be in existence is important to defense.   Defense does take money and people and it takes really sustain investment  over time.  We've had a dedicated information security team centralized  team with enforcement authority in the company since 2008.</p><p> WESTIN:  How is Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch position particularly when it  comes to trade problems, international problems?  Because you have very  substantial domestic U.S. deposit taking base that you offer now.  You have  international operations to be sure.  I know you had a China operation I  think you actually shut it down at some point.  Are you more or less  exposed?  And in fact we do end up substantial, can I say, globalization?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well our customers, no matter what jurisdiction or regulations or  country by country regulation exist, our customers are global.  And so  we'll do whatever it takes in terms of innovation or business model to make  sure we can serve their needs.</p><p> STEEL: Well, let's turn into your fabulous award you won.  It's aw way to  talk about gender diversity because it's not just sort of the buzzword, ESG  (ph) thing, right?  I mean look at California they're now requiring women  on board.  What do you think about that?  Like that kind of requirement  like Norway has which apparently hasn't really well for diversity.</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, I'm not sure requirements are the answer.  I don't think  prescriptions about where talent should be used or how talent should be  applied.  And as a woman, I would never ever want to think (INAUDIBLE) to  the strong women I know want to think they got the job because of a law or  a mandate.</p><p> What I do think is this, 50% of the people in the workforce are women.  50%  of the people to join our company are women.  As long as you get to higher  levels of management, 50% of our people are women.  When 50% of our CEO's  aren't women we have a measure of progress we have got to make.</p><p> WESTIN:  We have to make but how do we make it?  I mean you have this  experience in the boardroom, in the C-suite.  I mean how do we get there?   Because we talked about it a lot.  We don't seem to be getting there.</p><p> BESSANT:  I'm very fortunately because its front and center in the  conversations at the firm, 40% of our board is diverse, 40% women, 40% of  our management team is women, 40% of our top 1000.  So, I'm lucky and that  it's an active conversation</p><p> I will say this, I don't think that the talk and action and dedicated smart  people that have been working on gender diversity for decades, I don't  think we're seeing the progress that all of that thought should produce.   I've been thinking a lot about what should I be working on over the next  year.  I'm starting to have emerging theories about our women in power  alley jobs.  Jobs that take them to CEO roles.  I don't know I know the  answer to the next five years.  I know that what we've been doing in the  past hasn't been getting us where we want to go.</p><p> STEEL:  All right.  Just one other question like what's the problem?   Because now it's like CEOs are talking about it.  There's a mandate in  California.  Like it's on there.  It's up there.  Shareholders want it.   What's the biggest holdup that you see?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, I actually don't know the answer to that.</p><p> STEEL:  Fair point.</p><p> BESSANT:  I wish I knew.  If I knew, more than one of my direct reports  would be to a woman.  I do know this.  Three years ago, three of my direct  reports where women, two hired way by other firms.  We aren't doing  ourselves as corporate industry and industry being, you know, helping  create new pipelines of talent where approaching each others talent, for a  lot of -- in some cases really good reasons.  When I do think the focus --  our focus as a firm is ensuring that the pipeline is strong enough to  produce the kind of results that take -- that get us to that 40% of our  senior workforce being women.</p><p> Tech disciplines if you don't mind by saying that.</p><p> STEEL:  Yes.</p><p> BESSANT:  Tech disciplines are really hard, right?  We can say 50% of the  entering workforce in general is women in U.S. colleges and universities  this year.  About 17% of the STEM, the engineering technology math  graduates, 17% of them will be women.  So, from the start in the tech  disciplines we under index.  And again, fortunate to work for a firm how's  all over this.</p><p> STEEL:  So, to brought now here and it's great to get you here to get your  focus on to the next year.  As you look at 2018, what's the biggest risk?   What will keep you up most at night?</p><p> BESSANT:  Well, the cyber reports to me, I focused every single day on  cyber.  And if the board was asking me, I would say third-party risks in  cyber.  So you've given us a great platform to talk about that today.  I  also think the pace of change, regardless of whether its cyber or  technology in general, one thing I spent a lot of time thinking about is  has the pace of change exceed in enterprise's ability to keep up with it.   So, and I believe there are lots of solutions to that.  That will be a huge  focus for the firm as we move in to next year in my spaces.</p><p> STEEL: Cathy, so great to catch up with you.  Thank you so much.  Catherine  Bessant of Bank of America, Chief Operations and Technology Officer.   Great, great to see you.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.
